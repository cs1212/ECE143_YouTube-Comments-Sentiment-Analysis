Thanks for showing off Surviving Mars with us! Let's collab again sometime ;)
Earth: stop greenhouse gases

Mars: support greenhouse gases
I love these videos they make applied Science and Mathematics fun
you should do a video on "don't starve"
If we ever see another Paradox game getting SCIENCE'd, could you maybe consider the terrifying implications of the crisis events from Stellaris? Most specifically the Prethoryn Scourge and the Contingency, which I think are the more possible of the four crises.
I still see no richest video game character ever episode.
On earth: we must protect the planet 
On Mars: nuke it
10:00
Just use a bunch of thermoelectric cells.  It'll be fine.
Game: hey wanna put our game in your video.
GT: Urm..
Game: We'll pay you.
GT: YOU FOOLS
Elon Musk better Get a Pen And paper While Watching this video
I just wanna know who the richest videogame character is.
Flat Earth Believers : Um, actually we cant possibly colonize Mars. We'll just fall off the bottom
bionic colonists...
synths..?
sYNTHS..?!
SYNTHS !!!!!!!!
We Finns actually created a super lichen for this very purpose
"Bombard with green house gases."

Companies that burn stuff: "PERFECT"
Video:How to colonize mars.

Elon musk wants to know your location
This is alsome do more videos on this topic this was ALSOME.
Um I think running nuclear reactors 25 hours a day is still a problem.
The magnetic North Pole is located at the geographical South Pole not the geographic North Pole...
At first I was like, wait, he doesn't sound like MatPat, wait, this isn't MatPat!  Then he won me over. :)
I've been playing Surviving Mars for the past 2 months, what is this glitch in the Matrix?!
U.S. Army: Alright boys lets bomb Mars with Nitrogen and Argon!
‚Äú25 hours a day‚Äù

You realise both Earth and Mars days are only slightly more than 24 hours right?
in a single one of your videos I learn more than I did in my science class this whole year UwU. Congratulations.
No one:
Absolutely nobody:
Literally not a soul:





Game theory: kRaToS fRoM gOd oF wAr wAs A nAzi
This is basically a cook book for planets.
5:46 I love how the time in the background is linked up to the time of the video nice feature man!
1.18 Dwarf Fortress refference LOL I LOVE DWARF FORTRESS TRY IT
You posted this the day I beat ultimate nightmare mode with only a pistol.
I love you.
Oh. This WASN'T DOOM.
OOPSIE
I like the Classical music in the background... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
But the biggest question still stands: if we colonized Mars and there were earthquakes in there, would they be called MARSquakes instead?
You should make life theories
Otherwise conspiracy theories
Would it be more practical to just mega dome Valles Marineris, enclosing it and in effect just terraforming a small part of the planet?
Terraforming Mars (board game) creator should be proud. Insanely accurate xD
Just call Weyland Yutani. They'll do the entire program for the low low price of your soul.
I love that you use the invader zim as your crazy personality
I bet most of you who watched this thought ‚Äújust plant trees lol‚Äù before realizing it‚Äôs super hard
Y'all out here racking your brains for years to get an atmosphere on Mars while Phineas and Ferb did it on the moon in one day smh
10:05 or you're effici√´nt and get multiple weaker magnets to follow the same path, so the distance increases the needed power less expensional
Woh he said conservative, AND wore a make the air breathable again hat.
But that's just a theory a political theory
This. Game. Looks. Amazing.








That‚Äôs how you make an ad
Just read The Martian
(Please it's my favorite book ever)
Carmen starts playing

"Dear Austin,

HI! It's me! Paradox Interactive..."
nasa: austin we need you to add a bit more co2 into the atmosphere about 0.3%
austin: (adds 0.4% of carbon) 
screams outside 
nasa: austin what was that
austin: i added too much co2 now the atmosphere is on fire
Game theorist: Being flooded by oxygen could be very deadly!






Olimar from pikmen: You got that right......
Hey, Austin when will you continue the richest videogame character mini-series that you started? and never continued? :) good video btw
95.32% of mars‚Äô atmosphere is carbon dioxide? Jeez if plants could grow there they would thrive
comawn, it's obviously 'asdf - X'
did you not grow up on the internet?
Welcome to game theory, where unofficial scientist tackle real problems.
Just letting y‚Äôall know it‚Äôs 66% off on steam rn. 22 bucks for the game and season pass
This really makes you think

We as life, are really just an elaborate cancer meddling with other cells (planets) 

Turning them into this weird humid moist ball that suits us
13:52


>Allegro Con Fuoco starts playing
I am going to make the same point in Matpat's new video and it is that England does also use mph not just America. GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT! 4:18
3:40 it's not only that. It's also radioactive fissable materials decaying, raising the temperature, creating magma currents that help maintain the spin.
So, no, I don't beleive that. And you shouldn't either.
I say we just f*kin‚Äô yeet some asteroids at Mars to make it bigger and possibly reheat the core.




That‚Äôs scientific speak, btw.
i have a question :
wouldn't humans living on mars evolve different than those who live on earth due to difference in gravity?
like the specie itself having weaker muscle in 50.000 years or so?
Aliens: We need help heating our planet
Humans: We got it
Why does the thumbnail look like Lewis Brindly of the Yogscast?
lemme just contact spacex and nasa because someone  needs to hire him
Not gonna lie, all I was thinking about was Stellaris at the start of the vid
"bionic utopia built upon the bulging corpses of dead strangulated organic humans"
Why don't we just take our Co2, and put it somewhere else?
Paradox working with Austin just works too well LOL
Sax Russel would get PISSED at your two stage plan for Mars' atmosphere
This bubbels could also fix your solar problem if they're from a material that absorbs or reflects in every spectrum except the visual and some shades of blue.
Painted glass might be really effective in that regard.
Mars is the red planet, that makes it our planet comrades
Can Matpat please cover Markiplier's DAMIEN??
wait. . . Austin will judge ?
MOM CAN I BORROW YOUR CREDIT CARD ?
25hrs a day huh?








Sounds like we may need three nuclear power plants
If tut was DOOM we'd have had mars colonized and owned in a day
Mars is easy

Now Venus... Thats a challenge
Another planet where humanity will soon destroy...

Humanity: So, What planet next?
THIS YESSS!!!! More of this please, but on ur page maybe? so i can dump this one?
hi internet! though generating a magnetic field, survivable o2&co2 levels, and warming up mars seem quite do-able, what are we going to do about dem perchlorates?
Austin: Can I explain lagrangian points?
Me: Getting that watch time up, eh?
Just when I thought I was finished with Astronomy, I get this jewel. Thanks Austin üëç
Thing is, the dust on mars is incredibly fine
The Omnissiah approves of your colonization methods.
I JUST GOT THIS GAME ON XBOX TODAY WOW
SUCH A GOOD GAME THANK U PARADOX INTERACTIVE
(Before this video) But good Game!
I wonder what it's like to live on Mars.

It wouldn't be easy.
Why do you always have classical music in the background at some point in at least 1/3 of you  videos? Also, there are only 24 hours in a day. (9:56)
Ahh, the Dvo≈ôak on that last segment... sighs deeply with contentment
Austin how dare you tempt us with DOOM. At least we have Roanoke
11:22


also plants don't photosythesize during night due to the lack of light so they actually "breathe" like we do...
What about surviving Oddworld, though?
"Deal with our problems like grown ups."
looks at our politicians
.... .... ....
Trust me, I saw toddlers with better ideas...
You are always playin' mah boi Antonin Dvo≈ô√°k when the time is right, and I'm loving it. The New World Symphony will always be a classic favorite to me.
I used to enjoy Oxygen not included, that was my survive space game
To quote a very wise man, ‚Äúthe imperial system of measurements makes NO-GOD-DAMN-SENSE‚Äù
What‚Äôs the classical music that starts playing around 6:20? Sounds super familiar but I can‚Äôt figure out why
"launches 500,000,00" minuteman III nukes"-For our survival :P
Plans to talk about game but actually changes everyone's life as we know it
Partial Dyson spheres are good for heating up planets. It would also make energy for the magneto-sphere a non issue.
For a second I thought the game was DOOM but I was shortly disappointed
We could use crispr to speed up our evolution to help us live on Mars or even breathe in co2!!!!!
I just noticed,



The longer i watch, the more likely This is like a sponsor videoüòÇ
Austin: Step by step
Me: ooh baby, gonna get to you girlllll
You: what.
Austin Btw I have 700+ hours on gmod

IM NOT ADDICTED YOU ARE !
My first thought about the atmosphere was, needs more nitrogen.
James Charles is taking down game theory and is touching mat





Like to use uno reverse card
The title had me askin "and exactly how is this a GAME theory?"
I thought this was gonna be a video about kerbal space program lol.
Please tell me the service battery backup and the magnets to mess up crashing into earth and killing a soul
Mm
fun to know that by the time I'm an adult, Earth will nearly be dead because of us.
Hy
I played surviving Mars when it was free to play back a couple of months ago I loved it but was never able to buy it. NOW ITS BACK
Dear NASA
you should have paid austin for this video
sincerely A FAN ;)
Sooooo... Terraforming Mars should just be a project for the future when we're trying to figure out how to terraform? Ok!
100,000 years, don't make me laugh. I'll definitely live to see that. definitely...
Wow 40 seconds...
Really...
33 views and 50 likes
YouTube really needs to lay of the alcohol
I thought this would be a Destiny 2 theory...

:(
Wait, can you put magnets that powerful right next to fission reactors? I feel like that shouldn‚Äôt work
Humans: Chlorine in Pools

Mars: Chlorine in Soil
This video is fake because every planet is flat. JK
"toddler" and "molested" in the same sentence and still monetized üëè
You said that the magnetic field strength drops of exponentially, rather than linearly, but this is false. 
For a point charge it drops of cubically, or following the inverse cube law.
Stop Haveing SO MANY BABY'S...






Damn hitting it raw
Austin do yous till plan to finish the rich video game character series? I was very interested in the final result. Great video! Much love! <3
10:04 i thought austin was about to say science b**
Wouldn't it be easier to build an atmosphere below the surface rather than above while building the co2 levels over time.
Climate change, not Global warming.
How to terraform Mars:

Heyyyy isnt silver actually the best conductor and would work better?
Can I suggest the game theorists to theorize the science of gravity cancelling in Brawlhalla? I'd really like to see thatüòÑ
15:30 nearly spat out my cereal, "Hey, I needed that, OH GUESS IM DEAD NOW!"
it took me till 14:20 but that music
is it really
are you really playing
Rhapsody of Fire?
Emerald Sword Saga? 
The Wizard's Last Rhyme????
who else recognized the soundtrack from the Harry Potter Quidditch game?
Glory to Robotica! Mars is mine not yours Austin!
This game is amazing.  It's your basic city planner, but it's a hell of a lot more complicated from the start, with just the base game.  Haven't played the expansion yet, but excited to after watching this.
I heard TSO in the background of the first couple minutes, anyone else?
Now I'm imagining a video on the historical consequences of Ulm taking over all of the Holy Roman Empire
Thanks Austin
Hi Austin don‚Äôt have any good theory‚Äôs for you but just thought it would be nice to say LOVE THE VIDEOS
Now we got to warm up this planet
Me: Global Warming!
MatPat, do you think you could do a game theory about black ops and it's storyline? :)
I would love a collaboration between the theorists and V-sauce 3 !
God damn, the game is only like 10‚Ç¨ right now. Definitely picking it up!
nice catch. Was always eyeing this game. Your video and the spring sale was golden; $25 CAD for the whole deal (season pass that includes all DLCs up till now) :D
Why don't you just explain things?

Just do what GLADOS did and speed it up really, really fast and let us slow it down.
1st. I thought the biggest problem with teraforming Mars were the super powered roach people
2. Dvorjak Symphony No. 9 at 14:00 one of my most favorite songs thank you
aw man
I wanted to learn about the L1 Lagrangian point
wish they wouldn't edit stuff out like that
Watching the video casually, then suddenly...
13:52
ARGUS!!!!
Oh wait that was the moon...
Hey! I played the song in the background in my orchestra! (Day of Wrath)
I think it's awesome that they used Dvorak's ‚ÄúNew World Symphony‚Äù in a video about conquering a new planet - quite literally, a new world.
Warhammer 40 k has taught us everything we need to know.
"Hey, i needed that 
Oh no i'm dead now" so funny ü§£ü§£
I have another idea to restore Mars¬¥ electro-magnetic field: Drill a hole to the core and melt it. :) 

In my defense, I never said it was a good idea.
Scientist 1: Greenhouse gases are destroying Earth and we need to move to Mars. 
Scientist 2: How do we terraform it?
Scientist 1, snorting coke: With greenhouse gases
can you continue " The Quest For Find The Ritchest Game Character Or Something. . ."
i even don't know anymore what the tittle
We should start doing this now, and fixing other things, so we have a backup plan if earth gets hit with another extinction asteroid.
Magnetic coil could less unreasonably be made of a superconductor.

Liked the point on cyanobacteria and lichen.
Hey Austin, I know this is sorta off topic, but I was wondering if you‚Äôd be interested in doing a video on how the Ion Cannon from the Command and Conquer series works, (and/or the rift generator and mothership)
I've never been so exited about global warming before!
With the giant magnet in the middle of space, wouldn't it affect the earth's magnetic field as well?
Ah, so the solution is to make a dyson sphere and beam the energy to the magnet thing
Doubt: Atmosphere makes a difference in gravity? I mean the gravity as it is now will be the same after terraform mars?
So global warming ruins society and fixes it
Nice
What if we doubled and tripled down and produced 4-5 times the amount of CO2 and Lichen on mars?
freaking awesome! keep on going Austin, your brain is amazing!
How about Phobos and Deimos? How would the tides if we managed to create an ocean on Mars?
Did you steal the idea from Kurzgesagt? Or rather. Borrow I should say
(sigh) If only we had Lava Elemental's.
Wow... I littearly just started playing this like 2 days ago. The game is really fun!
This is probably dumb but since Marses core froze, (ignoring financial support, labor and time) could you reheat the core?
what do you think post-cyanobacteria creatures looked like...?
who else was expecting doom t the beginning? like if you were... ;-;
Austin, I have watched you for years and will watch you for many more years to come üòÄ
T R E E S   D O   N O T   P R O D U C E   O X Y G E N   in volumes that matter.
Stop with that crap. Oxygen is majorly produced by swamps and oceanic microorganisms.
Move cattle production to mars, 2 birds with 1 space stone
Did a youtuber just figure out how to survive on Mars

mostly...
"unmolested dandelion in the grass" I've never thought of it that way.
HEY YOU if your reading this i appreciate your being
Sub to game theory and film theory for more SCIENCE and lore explanation 
Cya around people
It‚Äôs one problem with that you said 25 hours a day
Unrelated but Could the l1 point be used for a space elevator?
Considering your musical tastes, it's surprising that nothing by Holst ended up in this video.
I was getting ready for school and heard about how these nuclear and global warming problems will happen in decades. Well fudge.
Who else thought of Total Recall when he talked about releasing the CO2 from the ice packs?
Are you working on part 2 of the richest characters video? I really enjoyed and you do did you so I want to make sure you'll release it.
I just started downloading this game before I checked my subscriptions and saw this
What if we mix genres here like using human modification from Halo and cybernetics from Deus Ex Machina to solve the human evolution part?
I love these videos but he actually sounds like a psychopathüòÇ
Dude, effective advertising. I'm gonna go get this game now!
Born too late to know nothing and live happy, Born too early to know everything and live happy...
Austin can we talk about classical music sometime, I love your taste
thanks for letting me down that i want be seening a green mars in my life time, my will to live is now at 000000000.1 %
Any other Suzuki Violiners taken back to the days of sawing out Humoresque at 6:19?
I do have to add a correction: the energy of the core is not primarily from residual heat. It is from the radioacive decay of those dense metals like uranium.
The hellscape that is Venus is quite literally a better option than Mars. If you high enough in its atmosphere all you'd need is a O2 tank and hazmat suit.
I thought that was matpat in the thumbnail
Now all we need to do is slow down or halt global warming, while making sure our economy doesn't flop, while also keeping the world happy... oh boy...
Ah yes, all the complex moving parts of a tree
I came expecting a book review on the Martian... I don't know if this is better or not
Game: Adds an option to torture people
RTGame: Let me introduce myself
I feel uncomfortable watching this without hearing Austin say "Dear whateverthefuck....!"
In 200-500 years we may be able to somewhat pull this off
Anyone leae noticed the asuras wrath music? I LOVE IT!!
we watches vid
yep this only reinforces me getting this game
9:56 25 HOURS A DAY? According to which planet?
So... we'd get close to needing...


1.21 GIGAWATTS!?!
" STOP HAVING BABIES, I CAN ONLY BUILD SO FAST!!! "



yeh and they reproduce even faster.
This video:
Elon Musk: Hold my beer
Why don't we bring a Oxygen pipe from earth to Mars. üòâüòä How much plastic would we need.
Something about you having toddler and molest in the same sentence bothers me
But I'm not sure why
Your a red he‚Äôll scrap of inizing radiant for saying bad things about mars
I knew the basics of the stuff he mentioned... I'm a major nerd everyone üòÇüòÇüòÇü§ìü§ìü§ì But I find this topic incredibly interesting and I'm glad Game Theory discussed what it would take to rebuild and maintain Mars' atmosphere!
9:57 WOW running it 25 hours a day that's a lot of work
6:00 just realised the stop-watch/timer lines up with the video timer
I have a fnaf theory,

If the crying child and michale are the smae person,then the bit of 83 would of never happend and neither would of any of the events of fnaf 1,2,3,4,5,6 and ucn
Please make videos on shoddy cast so you can swear more
How to Build

1) Moon Base
2) Dyson Sphere
3) Mars Base
We only have to be Running the reactors 25 hours a day he said. I cried as I yelled back at the screen, WE ONLY HAVE 24 HOURS AUSTIN, 24!!!
And here I thought the topic would be Doom's mars... sigh
Surviving Mars is a game where you survive on Mars. Who would've thought
during the watching of this im in the back of the room going cores are already solid due to the intense pressure
Then once we terraform Mars we can start the building of manufactorums and the creation of the Mechanicum. Praise the Omnissiah!
Shouldn't this be a film theory?
I WANT SOME TO DO A THEORY ON [FURRY] CHANGED!!!
I love how this is just a game but you made it into a Science ShowüòÇ
There's too much C02 in earth's atmosphere earth is going to die. Let's go to earth the atmosphere is 95% CO2 and we only have to heat the entire planet up to make it livable, wait what?
I should use this video for my science project
What if the game is using Austin's science to give this info to the government because the earth is ending and we don't know it?
Or we could just use global warming and you dehumidifiers to have oxygen because mars is very well humidified
I know a lot of people were bothered by it, but I really miss the screaming. It made Austin really entertaining to me.


Not that he isn't still.
Exponentially? Don't you mean quadratically?
1. Great vid 
2. If I had money I'd totally get the game
I honestly thought the intro would be an Elon musk reference
How coincidental, as I buy the game, game theory releases an episode on it
whats funny about this video for me is that for research project last year, I decided to do it on the magnetic shield, its so cool, and interesting
OK this is a very in-depth Austin video to ask this, but it's been perplexing me for quite some time.......

Why does Austin have sand in his hair? (And if it can be explained why he uses the small stripy child, I'd love that, also!)

Thanks! x
Is it bad that I always seem to enjoy Austin's videos more that Matpat's?
Geothermal energy actually comes from the radioactive elements too not just residual compressive heat.
Calculate the amount of possibilities in super Mario maker 2
Maybe the NASA help make this game kinda realisticly and logically by with the plans of terraforming Mars in future (IRL).
Hey... You forgot the moon.



Austin: Hold my beer.
Do a stellaris video and try to work out if the technology is physically possible
25 hours a day?
Math checks out.
need the name for the last 5 min sound track
its to epic
The science behind Bolters from warhammer 40k, how the hell you you maintain exblosive ammo like assault rifle mags without the risk of it exploding in your hands
Cool? Am I supposed to be happy? (Also, that last video got me hooked)
We should probably get started on this project now, you know, in case we accidentally kill our planet.
Damn i thought this was about red faction armeggedon (probably misspelled that ) or at least the hammer physics of what i think is the most destructive hammer ive heard of or read a blue print for.
A youtuber would probably be better at making Mars livable than government scientists
Where is matpat? I only watch this channel when matpat is here. You're just not as entertaining.
Please make  a sequel to the richest character video thanks (please no a who 3 situation dude)
OK Elon, pay attention now.  There's going to be a quiz.
Is it coincidence that I'm learning about planets and stuff in science rn? üòÇ
4:15

You deserved a dislike for that

Metric system is better than that crap
Lol just came back from Kennedy Space Center.
Awesome game concept, definitely. But a word of warning: DO NOT PICK IT UP ON PS4. Why? It's a buggy mess there. From what I can tell it's far more stable on PC.
Yo mat pat I have a question to make: why did purple guy killed Henry's daughter at the first place?
awesome video as always, but, I REALLY appreciated the post editing for the time code in the recording booth segment. Great detail... I check it every time someone tries to pass it off in a video as real. Obviously, you nailed it.
I learned that the ‚Äúatmosphere stripping‚Äù happened to Venus too. So... 3 Earths
Actually, it's been theorized that Earth's core houses enough uranium and plutonium to make a natural fission reactor keeping the planet's core heated.
Mars: *Exists




Elon Musk: Let me in! Let me in!
Welp, you just did NASA's homework
THE SCIENCE! Is why im still here, even as a robotics engineer i am so happy to learn new things from austin, thank you for teaching me too much physics, and enough chemistry i got my masters.
Yay wee are gona go to space wait 

A pysco will handle us
Nvm
yooo, Austin can you make a video on dark forest? like what caused everything or what it takes to survive in the forest.
When you hear Symphony of the New world so you imagine Asura Wrath terraforming Mars with fists
Not a physicist, but couldn't we use a few satelites in Mar's own orbit to create the magnetic field? Unless you're say that the Lagrad point is an orbital point.

Also, can't we eventually exhange the co2 for nitrogen?
Alternatively you could make a network of smaller electromagnetic satellites in near orbit around mars.  See Isaac Arthur's Outward Bound Series on Colonizing Mars for more info on that.
Send this video to all the scientists.


All of them.
Just wear a spacesuit and you won‚Äôt die, did you really have to make this vid lol
11:42 "Warming planets is our speciality" dam it be like that
Hey this is way Neil Tyson degrasse  says whatever we need to fix the earth will be easier than taraforming
There is still the energy problem combined with transportation. I'll buy it if I have time though.
eeeeehm, why don't we just make a magnet shield for the earth when she gets to cold, mars sounds cooler though but.... we're talking about the survival of our species here :D
Do you ever come to a moment in videos like this where you think to to yourself why you are  watching this
I asked my husband to explain the inverse square law and he gave me a great demonstration with his flashlight üòÑ
Did he say run the nuclesr reactor 25 hours a day?
stop using the same tone in every vid like jake R.
austin: how about liquefying the core of mars again? what would that take?
By the way co2 isn't toxic, it's just anoying.
Sure, the giant coil will stay in between the sun and Mars, but what about the gravity of other planets and celestial objects?
where was this video 2 weeks ago!!!!! I couldve used this for a paper I wrote
Richest people in games?
WE NEED IT
Can we just credit Austin because this video is 19:00 minutes long.
Still waiting for the richest video game character pt. 2?
okay there is a tf2 you tuber goes by sound smith and he left us a riddle/puzzle though out this vids with his permission(from him) could you connect the pieces
Now talk about Venus cloud cities...
*that is KMPH if your nation never went to the moon
Did you know your video is in the main menu of surviving mars that‚Äôs pretty awesome and  your ego was at first 87 and now it‚Äôs at 279
Any word on who the richest video game character is?
I need this guy to help me with my math homework üòÇ
1 or 2 nuks for testing and to stop world wold 2 but 14000 wath doz north corea do?!?!
What are you gonna do about the soil being toxic to the touch? the dust is 100% poisonous and will kill us if we touch it or breathe it in, and that wasn't addressed at all.

Edit: Nvm you just mentioned it in passing
Yep, thats why we need to invest in saving this planet rather than investing in experiments that, by the time they¬¥re useful, we wouldnt even by alive by then...
Here's how:

Grow some potatoes and science the s**t out of it
Woah woah woah, this game looks incredible? And it's by Paradox Interactive? It's gotta be good... need!
I love terraforming games.
Terragenesis is one of my favorite games.
Isn‚Äôt there a film theory episode about the Martian soil?
I would love to watch Austin play surviving mars! Just seeing him scream when his colony starts dying or him celebrating when he finally manage to make the air breathable!
Hmmm, the way Austin talked about this as well as show off gameplay made me think of purchasing the game. It's looks fun, and as someone who enjoys base building and space/cyberpunk stuff I can see myself getting the game a few years time. 
Thanks for the fun brain experiment Austin and the cool game idea Paradox Interactive :3
love that you use The Planets: Mars in a video about Mars.
it is probably easier for the 1st magnet solution.
I hope the flat earth society doesn‚Äôt start thinking about mars....
I feel as though games with a terraforming theme has great potential. A mobile game called terragenesis became one of the top apps on google play, is still being updated and supported and is actually quite enjoyable.
The new surviving mars expansion is being talked about to a great extent, with great praise about it so far.
Just don't tell EA about it.
Love ZZ Top in the la Grange (sp) model
Please turn the background music  way down next time please. There were moments i could barley hear what you were saying cause it was too loud.
Check out the Red Mars trilogy of books. Kinda dry narrarively speaking, but they damn they did the science.
I just spent 200 mexican pesos in a game i am probably never gonna play....
Hydrogen bombs don't really release much fallout only as much is produced by the needed fission starter
For the first couple words there I didn't even realise it was Austin
oh you forgot earth magnatic field seems to reverse soon, making wayy more radiation coming to earth and overall weakening for a whale 10000 years earth magnatic field
Is no one gonna talk about the fact he said 25 hours a day
5:09 should probably be on the poles since they are much cooler so it's easier to keep the magnets cold?
If the core of mars is a giant HUNK of iron like the earth's couldn't you run a massive electrical current through IT to make a supar giant magnet the size of the core of mars? And if you did would that create a artifical magnetosphere?
your very smart you know alot about mars these are not lies  my ser
Warming up the atmosphere shouldn't be so hard since humans are already very good at global warming :/
I see blue writing on the thumbnail,
I click
Lol. How are you going to cool nucleair powert station?
This video is amazingly (almost creepily) well timed for me.
Literally yesterday I was trying to figure out what it would take to terraform Mars 'cause I was considering running a futuristic D&D campaign set on a terraformed Mars.
Thanks for the explanation, I would probably have never figured out the electromagnetic "shield" thing otherwise.
I kind of wish we had more Theorist channels to be able to fill the four spaces in the logo
Hey mat how much value are the rings in sonic games
How about a fusion reactor to the magnetic shield
what happened to richest video game character!!!!!!!! are you bored with that? is the richest character unknown??
I thought the sadistic evil Lord will be Elon musk
Plankton produce more than 50% oxygen on our planet so that would be better than trees.
‚ÄúLike the sun is the biggest toddler in the universe and Mar‚Äôs atmosphere is an unmolested dandelion in the grass‚Äù that had me dying lol

WHO YOU GONNA CALL
psychic friend FREDBEAR!
BURY ME! BURY M- Oh wait this isn't TSTM
It was difficult to tell by the thumbnail that you were referring to a video game.
"Bulging Corpses", huh?

OwO
Not gonna lie....I was expecting doom....I am not ashamed to admit this
Why couldn‚Äôt you have posted this last year so I could‚Äôve used this for research for a project
Hmmm. This brings another problem... I remember an interesting tidbit that mentionned that maintaining our orbit around the Sun is, in large part, due to the mass of the Earth.... Which means it will take a lot of Earth's resources to colonate Mars, resulting in an increase of weight on Mars and decrease of weight on Earth, changing their orbits quite drastically. 

How does that factor into your equations?
Actually, the temperature of earth's core is not all remaining kinetic energy. If it were this way the core would have cooled long ago. A good chunk of the energy gets created by radioactive decay in the core
Austin: Provides a simple solution on how to deflect solar rays (create a magnetic pole)
Me: Oh, that's cool and simple!
Austin: Spends another 6 minutes on creating a giant magnetic shield in space.
Me: But you had already provided a solution.
Austin: "I've spent too much time talking about magnets?"
Me: Oh. You were just trying to pad out the run time. I get it.
That sounds like a big, big investment... are we worth it?
The water in your body won't immediately boil away!!!
Austin you need help
@TheGameTheorists
Please for the love of god figure out how big J√∂rmungandr (God of War) is. I really want to know but don‚Äôt have the ability to work it out myself. Thanks
I have always loved Austin's videos because of the way that he tears them apart, it's absolutely hilarious, and somewhat educational.
Well, we're humans, we can do anything if we put our minds to it
Your magnetic wires does not need to be full, you don‚Äôt need that much, it will be dictated by eat decipation of the cable vs current
Plants need lots of nitrogen to grow. Mars has less than 2% nitrogen on its body. I can see why colonizing Mars would be hard.
You know what's funny? I was wondering what would happen if the earth's core cooled. And what would cause it. I think I'm good now
if we can terror form mars, then how come we can't solve problems on earth
One of the other problems with creating an atmosphere is that the gravity of Mars is so low that it is entirely possible that any atmosphere we create would just float away.
Suggest just restarting the planets core by dropping several dozen nukes in.
Can you do a game theory on rusty lake series
i haven't been subscribed to this channel for years, but i got a notification for this video. i clicked the notification and it showed that i was subscribed with notifications on. what's going on, youtube?
Everybody gangsta til the coal factories walk to Mars
Don't mean to rush you or anything, but are you still gonna do Richest Video Game Characters Pt 2?
We have the tech to pull co2 out of the air and convert it back to fuel now so that would help.
Please tell me this game is coming to switch.
Could you possibly by any chance restart the core?
In space no one can hear you scream........... Unless your Austin, he could be heard from earth to mars.
If there is any update on the conversion rato on the cyanobacteria, please let us know!
complex MOVING parts of trees?
Can you do What Remains Of Edith Finch plz?\
running 2 thermonuclear powerplants 25 hours a day..., last time i checked a day had 24 hours. how do you plan to fit in 1 extra?
So what you're saying is that Elon Musk should give up his efforts on trying to make Mars colonization easier for us?
Why not create a floating city high in  Venus sky?

Already we don't need to worry about gravity, or atmosphere pressured!

Sure we gotta cool down the upper level but do some science gas covertion and boom Africa hot sky
Just incentivize the businesses to move production to Mars with no taxes. They'll pump out all the greenhouse gas we need, and all the useless crap we seem to want.
My brain collected nothingüòègood luck guysü§ó
Plant trees in the biomes, filter in the carbon, release the oxygen! Simple!
So, noone is talking about the Brewis Ginley lookalike in the thumbnail.
Are you using Mantra to terraform mars?




I make this comment because Austin used the boss fight music of Asura vs Augus.
i've seen more dead memes on this channel than google images
Dude review markipliers new vid Damien 
I think it‚Äôs the finale to who killed markiplier
Go check out Waking Mars. I think it may have some theory material.
9:56 25 hours a day?????
Last time I checked there were only 24 hours in a day!üòÇ
9:56 25 hours a day? Guess we also invented time travel
"Warning planets is our speciality" -Austin
Game Theory... The Show That's Smarter Than Science Itself
Simple, just don't open a portal to Hell in order to produce an otherwordly energy source for profit.
Spongebob:Remember licking Doorbells on other planets is illegal!!!
Let's try to colonize a planet that will without a doubt kill us, instead of taking care of the planet we currently inhabit.
You'll be fine as long as you don't ever teleport.
Never ever teleport.
Please.
Just do not teleport.
That dimension you go through?
That's Hell.
And it's full of demons.
Just...
Do.
Not.
Teleport.
It makes me sad that inhabiting Mars is so far away and I won't see it in my lifetime, still believe in Elon tho.
What if you could build a kind of space filter that filters out the deadly radiation, and extremely concentrates the sunlight and heat up the planet that way?
I appreciated the ZZ Top references inside of the Legrunge point
No "Hi its me, AUSTIN"

Me sad
you're the reason I still watch Game Theory
Or with a terraforming device we could do it in days/weeks if we advanced enough technologically as a civilization
So, the cyanobacteria needs water and carbon dioxide. And, we need to find a way to release all of the carbon dioxide from the ice caps, and transform as much of it as possible into oxygen.
Seems like all of these problems can be solved by growing lichen on the ice caps...
It would be easier to GMO the hell outta humans, rather than painfully try to ogment everything.
I may just be a stupid American, but is 2.5 kmph really that fast?
I hope Nasa watches this video and learn something about their absurd actions.
Our planets core is acctually liquid and hot because of radioactive decay processes, not from leftover kinetic energy. Otherwise we would allready have a cold core.
G R O W P O T A T O S W I T H Y O U R F E C E S
Ummm... How would you keep the shield in place?
I love the reason we would need to go to mars would make mars livable
Ngl but I honestly thought that it was Lewis brindley from the Yogscast in the thumbnail

But cool video anyway
anyone know if the game is available on steam?
Next thing we know this dude is the man that sends us to mars
Omg my class is talking about this right now so this is so helpful thank you so much!!!
At 14:00 who else can only think of Asuras wrath?
Do a theory on quintessential triplets because I want to know. Who married futaro at the end please I beg you tell me!
This is why humanity should focus on bionics instead. why terraform if we can become part or fully mechanical to withstand the planet?
My personal favorite way to restart the planet's magnetic field is to liquify the whole planet then steal moons from the gas giants to add to it's mass
Only a 150h? And you call that addicted. I've played a game on steam for 1500h and don't call it addictive. It's tf2
What if we were martians trillions of years ago before Mars cooled down and moved to earth?
I think you have just sold a fella a game.
Football field for measuring, Nice.
Dealing with the problems that we created like adults... Now THAT is science fiction.
I have a question
so if magnets loose their magnetism when they are hot how does earths hot molten core produce a magneto sphere?
Please try a video where you explain how little ol‚Äô Kirby can turn into a 100ton weight? How dense would that have to be?
See I mean you say that but...Thomas Jefferson did predict that it would take 200 years from the Louisiana purchase to fully settle Ohio, and then we could expand further westward, so...ya never know. For all you know, we could figure out some magic space dust or something that lets us do it in 50 years instead of 500.
About the atmosphere, why can‚Äôt we just live in a completely indoor area, and in suit when you actually need to go out of that
I didn't think anyone else played this game besides me, holy crap
HOW DID YOU DO THAT REFLECTION EFFECT? 
(The one where your wife is on the shiny  CGI surface of that coffin-joke) 
MY MIND IS EXPLODED!! 

HOW CAN I DO THAT (...but not with your wife, don't get the wrong idea, I mean the CGI reflection thingü§Ø)
Why dont we just take care of our planet?
He's.. actually calmer.  I like it now.  Good change
Wait are you saying the core is hot from pressure and not radioactive decay? hmmm...
Langrange points aren't difficult or tedious to explain though lol
okay so Austin + space colonization + science? I dont what I did to deserve this but I hope I do it again!!!
9:47 why not just put your massive solar array in orbit with the magnet array? I.e. SUN > Solar Array (to get enough power to power the magnets) > wire/microwave laser power transmission to magnet array > Magnet Array > Mars.
Forget Mars. Let's just terraform Venus instead.
This is gonna be my campaign slogan ‚ÄúMake Mars Great again‚Äù
Another banger Austin, keep up the great work
It'd probably be easier just to kick start the core....
New World Symphony, huh? You‚Äôve really done me proud, kid
Could you do a theory on the Duolingo owl?
The devs are really smart having you make a video and then a free weekend on release
Wait so our planet is going to eventually end up like mars
But what about that deadly static thin dust?
Just... Look up Glitterhoof. This is in character for PI.
humoresque by dvorak great violin little tune....great choise
Who else thought he was going to say Elon Musk at the beginning?
0:25 literally me when I start most games for the first time
9:00 personally I'm thinking a different shape would make this way more achievable.  

I.e. a series of smaller fields shaped in such a manner to funnel the particles around like pinball.  

Or maybe go another route and redirecting particulars from outside the envelope and colliding them with other particles to redirect their path.

Although the math behind both of those would be.... horrifying.
How large would the magnets at the poles have to be compared to the massive one shielding the planet from a far?
Beat the whole planet with massive asteroids until it's as big a earth.
You should‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT ADDICTED YOU ARE*
I love shoddy-cast videos despite the extreme science . . or maybe because of it
This video is really cool! I hope you don't mind if I use it for a school project. I promise to credit you though! Thanks
a yes, a full 25 hour workday 9:56
The magnetic shield looks awesome, and the giant magnets at the poles also. But I've always wondered if it would be possible to just find a way to heat up the core of the planet and make it spin again. I know absolutely nothing about this, just curious if it would be possible on the long run.
God damn Earth. Man up and sort out your crap so we can leave
OMG what sid he do to light the atmosphere on fire isn't  mostly CO2 what did he do
Now this is how you market a video game!
No one:
Me: IS THIS FREE!?
3:03 sorry to get sciencey but that magnet is wrong... it's actually north on bottom and south on top üòÇ sorry lmao
This youtuber is trending...  This youtuber üòÇ üå∏ üåö üòÑ üí©
Anyone else think he should create a channel called ‚Äúlife theory?‚Äù
I see what you did with that end song and I approve.
I'm guessing that your loving this game Austin... at least till you wiped every colonist out that is.. guess that went south a bit fast. Better luck next time.
Is that Verdi's Requiem? And Humeresque!
elon musk has 100% watched this video.
Wouldn‚Äôt the magnets pull the soil to them? *not trying to destroy the theory I‚Äôm just wondering
Wait, if we got rid of the carbon dioxide the planet would get cold again, and become inhabitable... Right?
Nice ZZ Top Easteregg with that Shield
What's the song at 4:20 ? (heheheh) but seriously
*clicks on video*Realizes it‚Äôs not Matt*Clicks off video *
After you increase the o2 levels put down trees?
I thought that i clicked on the wrong video in the first few seconds
Venus Is The Better Pick. Or The Moon Europa.
Elon musk wants to know your location
a Dyson sphere could provide the power for the electroshield
me living in the same state as the giant supervolcano wow another reminder of the human races overdue incineration
Yeah... Relying on such totally reliable component as nuclear station, placed in a such totally accessible place as space with a mass only about several thousands tons responsible for sustaining life on a whole planet is a great design
Anyone remember the song that is used in the making the atmosphere breathable section ik I've heard it but can't remember where though
Tell us more about Lagrange points!
2:30 Or not and invite the doomslayer for some tee and biscuits every now and then
Who else thought the sadistic evil overlord was Elon musk?
Elon musk wants to know your location
By "nigh-unstoppable sadistic evil demonic overlord", I assume you mean the Union Aerospace Corporation?
4:14 Austin don't forget that science is done in metric units. You sad it.
25 hours a day?! I guess not earth days. Unless your hour is different to mine.
hey as long as there is coal seams on Mars we can well and truly set those on fire
I dont know if you will see this, but in the start, we would be paying for oxygen because we would be oxidizing the iron on Mars
2 and a half kilometers per hour,  it doesn't sound that bad

I have a question for you guys....so in the new super Mario bros for the Switch there us a way to play a like Luigi version. In the beginning cut scene there is no mario....just his hat sitting kn the table. Wonder why?
That magnet at 3:20 is upside down, the magnetic north pole on earth is the south pole
Great video! Can you do a theory on DOOM?
I already learned about this in science!
Id say "dangers to ones biology" shiuld be pretty high up in their list of Preocupations.
Its just orbiting in a space station around the earth an astronauts still lose bone mass, problems with blood circulation among others.
Id say keeping your settlers alive would be # 1 xD
Or thats billions of dollars of equipment just lying on the surface of mars.
Hi can u make a new fnaf theory I'm really interested
Too bad we won‚Äôt be alive to see colonization of space

scratches head i would have loved to see a solution to heat the core up again more
Really cool video, I would also just like to take a moment to appreciate the background music you to your videos. It seems like a small thing but really I love what you do with it.
You do not need a spacesuit you will die any ways by old age
So just die in a few seconds without a space suit
Would this be a viable terraforming solution:  set up powerful magnets along the equator, spinning the magnets around the solid iron core in hopes of melting it with eddy currents?  If you could get this to work, it might solve the magnetic field, temperature, and atmosphere problems at the same time.
Another awsome episode. Can't wait for the next one.
I just hope this happens someday
Lol could you imagine NASA watching this
I love this game and it‚Äôs free on Xbox live for now

Or just colonise smaller parts, so you don't have to alter a whole planet.
Just so everyone knows its also on xbox and ps4
50000 nano teslas is a lot of small electric cars
Devorak's New World. Very appropriate.
man the orchestra music is so good to the ears with him ranting about mars
the game is free through xbox game pass for now
You forgot to mention the Tharks at the start of the vid.
didnt your mother ever tell you to use your indoor voice? why do you gotta shout so much, the 2012 shouting lets player days are behind us
when ur polar ice caps are literally dry ice
Did you say raising the temperature... it's Mars closers to he sun. Oh you meant the core.
fun fact, lichen also filters out carbon dioxide
First, we have to decide there was never any life on Mars which since scientist hate being certain of anything would be harder than anything you said. I love the asteroid bombardment. 
One. It is a lot more efficient than Nukes even the Tsar Bomba is nothing compared to a 100m¬≥ of an asteroid. 
Two. We should start practising Asteroid redirection anyway so sending them to impact Mars uses an orbit distant enough where it's safer. 
Three. If we went crazy and vacuumed up every inner solar system rock we might even increase the Gravity.
WHAT! 
1.21 JIGGAWATTS WHAT WERE WE THINKING!!!
Nice to know that the northern lights is actually the sun attempting to kill us.
3:33 This is false, about half of the earth's heat output comes from the decay of radioactive isotopes inside, probably some actual fission too with just how much there is.
How about instead of colonizing mars people in the future learn how to move massive rocks from mediator belt and form new planets from scratch it may be impossible but maybe from crashing them together you can get a magnetic field ready to go
I heard you can rewarm the core with sending nukes to the center, is that not an option? (getting to the center would be difficult of course) but it may be cheaper depending on how we get to the center, maybe a trail of amonia leaking to the core to facilitate? just thinking of other ideas,   want more on this topic for sure
HeYYYYY iT<S meEE AUsTIInnnn  and welcome back to another episode of any thing but the second episode of "who is gaming richest"

Can you try to explain how the song ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget‚Äù is connected to undertale, because in undertale if you go behind sans‚Äô house and go to the lab, then open the drawer it says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a picture of three people you don‚Äôt recognize (maybe kris, Susie, and ralsei?) with the words ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget‚Äù ‚Äú so there‚Äôs more things for you to find out, good luck!
So you‚Äôve been playing this game a whole week straight?!
I bought the game halfway through the video, but didn't use your link - Sorry!
I subed because you seem like you can teach me a thing or two
Is it possible to maybe turn down the music just a tiny bit. My ears are bleeding
It's more likely we need to keep our planet safe we can't go to Mars because we don't have the technology yet we just got to keep  our Earth but no we're idiots
There's a proposal to use argon, instead of nitrogen, to provide for that extra mass and pressure, even with the lower gravity. Only problem is where to get all that argon.
How about we let humanity die. If our track record of missing up the earth is anything to go off, we don't need to ruin the rest of this beautiful universe
I just got this game today and this appears what the hell
Hey Austin where is the mini series :who is the richest video game character?
25 hours a day... was that on purpose?
Terraforming make the atmosphere warmer we are great at that
Honestly easy solution to the CO2 problem and evolution taking too long to fix it: Don't wait for evolution. Simply modify the people themselves, be it via genetic engineering or otherwise. Untill we can do that protective equipment will still be needed.
When he said sadistic evil overlord that wanted to colonise Mars, I thought he was talking about Elon musk
I'd like to see the moon get terra formed as it be kinda cooler to me
Unfortunately, you'll never be able to warm the planet with green houses gasses. They arent that effective at retaining heat. Simply retaining the atmosphere would be all you need to start building up heat. It's because the solar wind rip away what air their is that makes the planet so cold. Being able to keep any sort of gas atmosphere will warm the planet.
First, you close the Hell Portal
9:57 ‚Äú... and run them 25 hours a day,...‚Äù Hmmmm.... I thought it was 24 hours a day.
Austin lit the world on fire......BIG OOOOOOOOOOF!!!!!!!
mars will never happen though you cant restart a planet's core that's like trying to start a truck with a potato for a battery. it's a fun fantasy though. but please focus on taking care of your only home earth.
Elon Musk Would Like To Know Your Location
No mention of using super conductiong magnets?
why are you screaming so much, cant watch that.
Just don't get too overboard with the greenhouse effect. We don't need another venus.
13:57 Did you just make an Idiocracy reference?
That intro reminded me of stalins rule
what song is he using for the epic music towards the end?
25 hours a day? when did that happen? as if days weren't long enough already.
don't forget the radioactive decay of the uranium in the core, it accounts for more than half of the temperature of the molten core
China can't even make their atmosphere breathable.
space travel, colonization and terraformation are liberal fantasies they are not financially viable at all humans are stuck here on earth, its here where humanity was born and here where we shall die
Maybe cockroaches can survive Mars ü§£üòÇ
Ok so umm I‚Äôm lost when he said 25 hours a day when it‚Äôs only 24 hours a day 9:55
or just continue after the electro magnet by BOMBARDING THE ABSOLUTELY LIVING H*CK out of mars with comets and asteroids no factories needed to increase the mass to subside the problems that human evolution might have to go through

Why the f did u have to go into evolution and it‚Äôs back story
Too much screaming and over the top drama music.
Why not use mirrors instead of so many solar panels?
or just use an asteroid and build a moon.
Is it possible to heat up the core? ü§î
Hmm, it would be much easier to build giant geodesic domes on Mars that are several km in diameter.
Another technological hurdle that he did not mention was a space elevator as one would be needed if you wanted to do large scale construction in space.
Oh i was playing that game its quite good
9:56 huh 25 hours a day???  Ummmmm Austin there is 24 hours in a day
Dude am i the only one who thinks this looks really fun?
2:40 damn what's that song? It sounds so damn familiar but can't put my finger on it.
You can turn off child birth in a dome... you know that right?
I think that this is what most of the fans want. Not Lore, not some theory on something related to lore, but science experiments and theories as such. I like where this is going.
Or we just have to find total recall machine, gg easy
PSA Free weekend on Steam right now if you want to try.
When does richest fictional characters pt 2 come out
Well actually no. Solving the problem of electromagnetic field is just one part of the equation. 

The issue comes from low Mars mass. There's 0.4 gravity (not 0.1) which would require crazy polluted atmosphere to maintain 1 atmosphere of, well, atmosphere. In other words that atmosphere will be unbreathable. Once you make it breathable, temperature drops, pollution drops, pressure drops and you're where you started.

So no, you can't make Mars atmosphere breathable and the right temperature both at once, ever.

It goes down like this:
If composition is ok, pressure and temperature is low.
If temperature and pressure is ok, composition is wrong.

Solution: Increase mass to equal the one of earths OR build a Dyson sphere, removing the need for magnet. But then, why not moon? It's smaller so it will be easier to build and anchor the Dyson sphere, it will also take less time to build up the atmosphere. With good enough material, you can inflate the sphere like a baloon. Sounds crazy? Yes it is, still less mad though than an attempt to terraform Mars.
Hey can I speak to mappat please cuz I have something that he may or may not like
might be able to mine some asteroids from the belt to get the copper easier and faster as it would already be in space and easier to move around. If you used thorium reactors in ships to get around, it would be faster too.
Use methane instead of co2 , it‚Äôs more toxic but by a lower factor to co2 than its efficiency. Get rekt
One way

No theory

Just death
*Elon Musk wants to know your location *
Please explain Fran Bow to us!!!!
So I was talking to my brothers about this earlier, but given that signals can only travel as fast as the speed of light (at most), that would mean that Mars would have to create its own internet infrastructure separate from that of earth. The Earth would be too far to create a stable high speed connection, much less create one that could work as efficiently as the one on earth, meaning one important thing: information isolationism. 


Historically speaking, communication between disparate territories is what creates a sense of unity. The Romans united the areas in their empire through a network of roads and their mastery of incorporating conquered peoples into their nation. For a more modern example, the United States Postal Service served not only as an outpost of the federal government during the 1800s, but served to link the eastern United States where mostly everyone lived with the people out west, creating a link. 


Taking this into consideration, the moment a Mars colony becomes self-sufficient, a timer will be set off. Due to the nature of information isolationism, each planet will develop its own distinct cultures, one that (as historical precedent shows) will cause a schism, and the eventual independence/revolution of the Mars colony. 


Then again, I could be completely wrong. This above scenario works best when it is one group/organization that colonizes Mars. If multiple nations due it, particularly nations that don't have the best of relations (i.e. US, Europe (I know this isn't a nation, but I am like 90% confident they share a single space agency), Russia, and China), it can be argued that no colony will ever be self-sufficient, as they will be constantly threatened by the existence of other colonies. 


Or I could be wrong about this, with all the colonies slowly drifting away from their parent, or for once in humanities existence, people being more concerned with not being murdered by the environment than not being murdered by other people. 


What do you all think? 
I want to see Austin's playthrough now
Elon Musk wants to

I absolutely love this video man
we need to show this to Elon musk
what is the music that is playing over the outro

Austin : 25 hours a day
Austin- once again proving that yes America, technically you CAN solve your worst problems with nukes, but you probably shouldn't.
9:56 25 hours a day? You do realise there are only 24 hours in a day right?
Hey that cod referance hurt man that scene was powerful
13:52 i lost like 50% of my concentration to the video as soon as that music started
Mars, home of the Adeptus Mechanicum...
I learned about lagrange points from Gundam
Dear sweet Jesus, I love your videos.
I thought that Mars was too small to keep any atmosphere in because of its poor gravity. That would mean that the CO2 that was released from the ice caps would just seep out of Mars into space.
Perfect! Now get the rig to space...
So what you are saying is that I will never live on Mars?
So we keeping the demon portals ?
......where was this video when I had to write a report on this topicüò≠üò≠üò≠
I was hoping it was Doom external hip
Why am I not surprised someone who thinks the Earth's core is being heated by left over kinetic energy from the planet's formation, rather than radioactive isotope decay by this point, also is still stuck on the concept of Global Warming or CO2 being a driver for such a phenomenon.
I hate to say this mate but you got paid for this and you did a poor job. I mean you don't even contemplate the fact that a 95ish % CO2 atmosphere, no matter how thin, using the Global Warming model could still be used to kickstart that initial heating phase as well, chuck enough CO2 into the mix and output heat and that should do a good job as well...if CO2 did have the effect of a greenhouse gas but that link is tangential/correlative at best.
25 hours a day?  Sounds about right.
Do a game theory on the desolate hope if you even know what that game is or if you can get your hand on the game

13:46 that hat is a good idea though, it gets your attention by looking like a maga hat, but then you read it and bam thats how you inspire environmentalists
It is cool game, but is it realistic? Hell no!


First of all concept of terra-forming is debatable itself. Usually investment of resources doesn't justify gigantic costs of this proces, what make closed habitats valid alternative. And idea of terra-forming more a dangerous pipe dream. Still it is a game, so what ever.


Otherwise game is well prepared. Only mechanics I dislike are:
- Crammed resource issue. I would preferred if on beginning of the game we would focus on several outposts providing separate resources for own global project (especially as we have interplanetary transport). Yes, we could get oxygen and water with MOXIE's and Water Vaporizers. But they should be inefficient sporting only basic staff. In order to build town we should need build Water Plant, what also would produce oxygen and fuel (that last is included). Anyway I would focus game balance on cost reducing. 
- Also oxygen shouldn't really be used up that much thanks to purifiers. It should used mostly to fill our oversize domes and later atmosphere what shouldn't be too easy task.
- I also would expand orbit mechanic, with survey rovers and space supply depots. Tanking witch fuel made on mars also would be nice cost reducing mechanic.


But that is just my..

So what stops us from using solar energy to power the field instead of nuclear power plants? Maybe some type of reverberation technique to make the most out of the field for the least amount of material?

What was your thought on using white prosperous or napalm to melt the ice caps?

Would certain natural diseases help with the oxygen problem?
Here is an interesting contradiction: Climate science today on earth: "We have to reduce the greenhouse effect by reducing CO2 production to save the planet!" Game Theory: We have to pump Mars, that have a 95% CO2 atmosphere content, full of greenhouse gases to warm it up!" Sooo on earth CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but on Mars it is not a greenhouse gas?? I'm confused.
Ahh Austin likes paradox too
We dont need to make it like earth to live on it
If I were to appear on a planet identical to earth and uninhabited by any other sentient species with 49 hoomans, what would be the fastest way to explode, freeze, burn, make uninhabitable via radation, turn to dust (somehow) or basically anything to make life impossible? My hooman friends were scientists and know how to make anything they just need to know what to make. 

Simplified question: What can we do to destroy the planet in the shortest amount of time?
So.... they turned mars into... Morrowind?
YELLOWSTONE monkaW CHAT WE FORGOT monkaW
But what about mars' soil. It doesn't have any organic material from which plants can grow. We would have to bring our own soil from earth and interplanetary soil transports would be crazy expensive thinking about how much it costs to transport a few tons in a single trip compared with the literal mountains of earth that we would have to bring there.
So on mars... we encourage global warming.

4:13 did you put that there, bottom left corner
The gravity on Mars is a much larger issue than you might think. Atmospheric pressure is basically just the weight of the atmosphere on you. On Earth it takes 39,000 feet of atmosphere to get the pressure right, on Mars it would need to be over 120,000 feet (36.5km). This extreme thickness would mean it would take a lot longer for the atmosphere to heat up and a lot longer to cool down. Basically you would have to perfectly balance energy in vs energy out. Not to mention it would take a lot less energy to strip the atmosphere away so you better make sure that magnet is powerful.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO, WHAT IS THE RICHEST VIDEO GAME CHARACTER
RIP Austin's wife in the game
1:15 Invader Austin!!!
You could increase Mars gravity the same way you are adding new material to the surface for the atmosphere. Dumping thousands of asteroids on the planet. However, if I remember correctly, the entire mass of all the asteroids in the asteroid belt wouldn't add very much. Mars is roughly a tenth of Earth's mass, and the entire asteroid belt is barely a few percent of Moon's mass. Would have to go looking for mass to dump on Mars, and that's not even accounting for it potentially changing it's orbit.
What were the first couple songs he used?
One thing i've learned from this video. Magnets at the poles is a much simpler idea. But then you'd have to take in account how easy are these things to destroy, how long would it take to get an atmosphere up and running. And how the hell are we gonna get it there to begin with? AND ON TOP OF THAT, how in gods green hell are we gonna get people there anyway? Some kinda cosmic space taxi?

My 1 year old son and I love watching your videos together, I don't know what it is be he loves your videos. Thanks for giving me a medium for bonding with my son while being able to relax and enjoy something with him I've enjoyed for 6 years. Thanks Matpat, Steph and Austian, and everyone else that helps behind the scenes, you guys are amazing
Guess people should stop ignoring and small talking problems and actually solve them instead of just laying everything in someones else hands, just out of convenience. Maybe science finds ways to utilize what Mars already offers for colonization before our planet blows up or we just all die in catastrophe or due rash environmental change we caused ourselves.
Wait a minute why would they need oxygen if trees basically excrete it. I mean aside from humans needing to breathe they would have a nice abundance of CO2 to go around.
What if mars is like the earth before, inhabitted by humans, then plants died because of humans then after the plants died  the planet lose its athmosphere by being blown by solar winds and then they moved to another planet which is earth and the goverment keep it from us by creating theories
Maybe there wasnt enough uranium in mars and that whys it died so fast along with its size. Earth has been helped to stay warm by the breaking down of uranium witch then releases heat so yeah.

We've actually accomplished enough on the climate change front that the climate doom deadline has been pushed back several times (not that the alarmists will ever admit it) that total nuclear apocalypse is a much more pressing concern.
THANK YOU GAME THEORY!! Y‚Äôall inspired me to write My American government paper on Global warming because it‚Äôs scientific rather than something that‚Äôs just straight up laws. All because I wanted to be like you guys and sciencey. Y‚Äôall are awesome, I love you guys. Keep up the FANTASTIC work!!
Yeah, CO2 isn't doesn't really hold a lot of energy. In fact, it is highly inefficient to do so. A chemist, someone who knows chemistry, and a physicist, someone who knows physics, got together and actually wrote a LOT of information on CO2 not being a greenhouse gas as the bought by government "scientists" would want you to believe so that they can keep getting grants and false prestige via government.
Anyway, all you have to do is go to the geology dept of the University of Leicester and other sources to find out that CO2 levels were 800-900 ppm at the beginning of the last ice age. Yes, that is correct. a little more than twice our current level of CO2 at the beginning of our last ice age. In fact, other ice ages that occurred before our last ice age had even higher levels of CO2. Funny thing that.
In fact, it was this little bit of information that brought a couple of wanna be scientists back in the late 1920's to scream that we were going to bring about an ice age with our industrial activities and that reached it's peak back in the 1970's where it finally dies out because none of the predictions about CO2 came true.
Fast forward a bit and we have vp algore (I do no capitalize the names of charlatans and scam artists) going on about global warming in the mid 1990's (I was in high school for that) and he was laughed off as some kind of kook. Unfortunately, there were other snake oil salesmen who saw the potential in promoting this lie and they jumped onto the bandwagon in promoting it and sadly, it has been propagandized to many and has become a cult like movement based upon altered data (see noaa altering historical meterological data and then quietly changing it back in order to push the global warming/climate change lie and get caught doing it) and full blown lies.
Hell, in 2009, algore even repeated a "scientist's" claims of there being no polar ice caps five years later unless the United States and all or most of Europe (take notice that both China and India have been putting out FAR MORE CO2 into the atmosphere before and after that date than the USA and Europe and continue to do so) go for a full on carbon trading program. It is also to be noted that algore setup a company to trade carbon credits and net himself TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS through this scam. Long story short, the whole plan got scrapped and algore's company never got to take off and rake in all the dough through a scam that would have driven the prices of goods way up in the USA and Europe while Russia, China, and India would be left virtually untouched and become the only major world powers.
I could go on, but I don't think that I could type out all that I would like to. Honestly, if you think any of what I posted is untrue, go do some research and tell me if I'm incorrect on any of this. Do not cite government sources as they LIE. Yes, colleges and other "educational" centers that receive money from government will lie today for it and I will not trust such information as they are bought and paid for.
If you want me to produce my information, I'll have to go and dig it back up. It is out there, just buried in order to keep pushing this lie of a man made global warming/climate change/whatever-the-next-big-scary-thing-humanity-is-supposed-to-be-the-source-of-thing in order to have us give our money and property to government to in order to combat this thing with no plan laid out in any way and will not be given to us under the auspices of "you wouldn't understand it" in order to keep us in the dark and losing our freedoms to the power hungry.

P.S.
In order to make Mars habitable in any amount of time would be to slam two fair sized asteroids made of iron and nickel into Mars at just the right angles in order to keep the proper orbit, heat it up, and after a few million years, colonize it. The heat of the impact could, in theory, make a nice molten core similar to that of Earth's. After the planet has more or less formed to a good point, start raining down comets made of water in order to get rivers, lakes, and oceans and then let loose the cyanobacteria.
Yeah, it is a long process, but it could work.
you should just play stellaris instead.
so... throwing a crack theory out there but couldn't we, we had the technology, throw an asteroid at mars? if i recall an asteroid of a significant size hit mercury and briefly restarted its core, unfortunately for mercury it's literally right next to the sun so this did nothing overall but astronauts did say mercury briefly had an atmosphere again. so... couldn't we do that to mars?
Instead of nuking the ice caps, we could launch H-bombs on them, this creating less radioactivity in the water and air, because h-bombs create more radioactivity in creation then they do after the explosion
Why not go with the giant magnets on the planet again?
couldn't you just remelt the core?

Why would they be dissuaded from sponsoring you? Your videos are the ones I try to watch as soon as they come out (sorry Matpat, you're cool, but Austin's screaming, self-induced aneurisms are hilarious)
Also, wouldn't it be theoretically be possible to restart the magnetic field of Mars by slapping a metric mcf*ckton of rockets to the surface, all pointing the same way, then redirecting a bunch of asteroids from the asteroid belt to slam into it, to increase the mass until it's large enough to sustain the newly molten core? I mean, it would probably be impossible to get enough fuel/materials for said rockets, but THEORETICALLY...
Do a disenchantment theory
We need to crash comets on to mars to add water.
START A TIRE FIRE AT THE POLAR ICE CAPS
What about the soil and that extra
You only need two things to terraform Mars: moss and cockroaches. You see, the moss will absorb sunlight and the cockroaches, barely able to survive by eating the moss, will die and spread the moss around everywhere and Mars will heat up and release the carbon dioxide inside itself. After 500 or so years, BOOM, you got yourself an atmosphere. I mean, of course the cockroaches will be influenced by Rahab's Legacy and evolve into superpowered Homo Erectus-like creatures who kill humans on sight, but just don't worry about that part and it'll all be fine.
So only if earth turns to mars mars will turn to earth and still have lots of problems

Sorry dude but some of your theories have flaws. For one thing "global warming" is a conspiracy theory perpetuated by those in power who want to keep the little man down and fearful. How many of those out there advocating for the world's destruction by the hand of man or eoman drive super expensive gas guzling cars or fly their airplanes all the time thousands of miles just to give a speech on how vehicles are gonna kill us all! Go down here to the links provided and tell me what you think. One of them shows data that back in the dinosaur times CO2 was FIVE times the concentration we have today. Guess all those dinos became extinct cuz they were all driving gas guzzlers huh... Please prove me wrong using this new information as a base line.

ELON MUSK WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
I think the gravity issue is the biggest hindrance.  At least, as far as we, humans born on Earth, would be concerned.  I think Venus would probably be the easier to terraform first, because of this.  If we tried to smash something into Mars that is big enough to increase its mass by enough to generate Earth-like gravity, it would take a REALLY long time to cool down, but it would probably solve the problem of a magnetic field.

What's the song that's playing on 10:07?
The idea of terraforming Mars to escape climate change on Earth is wrong on a fundamental level: If we have the technology to terraform a dead planet, we can as easily use it to fix our own. No need to build up a workable atmosphere and usable temperatures, no need to deal with solar winds, no long wait to cultivate and spread organisms to get working and stable ecosystems... We're 99% there even if the worst case happens. Fixing Earth is ridiculously easy compared to terraforming Mars...
Hey Austin I wanted to point one thing out to you if the wire was as thin as you suggested at the power you suggested then the wire would get so hot that it would likely melt I understand space is a very cold place but i don't think it's cold enough to keep the wires from melting. In addition you mention building nuclear reactors to produce the energy but surely conventional cooling methods would not work and unless something else was built to cool it surely the reactors could produce heat that could potentially cause problems. Essentially I'm saying everything is going to be too hot.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong

"And since our own core is cooling at a rate of 100 Celsius every billion years, this MAY be something we want to keep in our back pocket", you sure? I mean the sun is estimated to go supernova in the next 4 billion years, or so? And our core is over 5000 degrees Celsius.

Would there be any way to essentially melt Mars' core, restore it to the moving, molten iron needed to generate its own magnetic field again? Like, theoretically speaking, what would be needed? Making Mars rotate faster? Nuclear bombs in the core? Or even using theoretical, likely even exaggerated methods, would it be impossible with modern knowledge?
Mars is my favourite video game
Another Austin video, another easy pass.
Ok, I know magnets are more fun, but making soil from scratch is a way harder problem than the solar wind. We know how to do giant magnets, it's not a complicated engineering problem, it's just time consuming to get the materials. Soil, on the other hand we only barely understand. There is an absurd amount of life going on in a small handful of soil and it is not as simple as putting the components in a mixing bowl.

One question. Could we take a solid chunk of the nuclear bombs on earth and dig holes deep into the core of mars, setting them off in sequence to liquify and spin the core, creating a cosmically temporary magnetosphere? You could dig one large hole with many branching paths once you get closer to the core, which would reduce the needed work as it would reduce the distances needed to dig to place the nukes, which would also provide a large amount of metal and stone for building on the surface. Then, once the nukes went off, most of the radiation would be contained deep within the core of Mars, as long as we capped the hole properly, and bada bing bada boom, no need for a space coil which could be destroyed by asteroids or terrorists and undo all of our terraforming progress.

Hmmm.... About your carbon dioxide addition, there actually isn't any solid evidence that more carbon dioxide means our temperatures rise. We're definitely putting a lot of it in our atmosphere, but that doesn't mean it is the culprit. Correlation does not mean causation, even if carbon dioxide is one of many reasons behind our warming, it might not be the biggest culprit. Oh hi, people calling me a climate change denier!

Relying on human evolution isn't a way I would adapt, especially since that requires letting those unfit to survive, die off. Trans-humanism is the only real way you're gonna get that to work, make humans able to survive there. That'll still take time to develop, but not 10,000 years type time.

Dear Matpat,
I have a legit theory on the basis that IRON MAN WILL COME BACK. I really hope that you make a video on this theory. I'm a huge Marvel fan, and have read tons of comics, and watched tons of Marvel movies. My theory is based on the Secret Empire series. If you look closer, many points are connected between the Secret Empire and the Marvel's Endgame. I'm not gonna list my reasons here, just in case someone else takes it, but trust me. I have lots of evidence. And, you'll probably find more when looking deeper into it. If you are interested, email kogipetunia@. Please don't reply to this comment, because I'm gonna post it on a bunch of episodes. Thanks. Even though you're probably never going to read this.  :(

Would making a moon work? The tidal forces would heat up the core, making the magnetic field. We could use passing asteroids to make it, by putting them together. I am actually interested is whether this would work, please leave a comment.
Screw Mars I'm going to Venus instead, a magnetic field, an actual atmosphere, and much more tolerable gravity... though I'd probably need a gold plated habitat there.

What abtou mars gravity?
Also, yes these time scales sound long but remember, it took earth way longer to reach this state naturally. About 4 billion years from the first appearance of simple life to the appearance of hominids. Bearing that in mind, 500 years to teraform the planet is really impressive. Even if this is pretty conservative this would still be pretty incredible. The reason we would be so much faster is the slowest process in the development of Earth's environment was evolution. From the first appearance of life it took about 1 billion years for photosynthesis to begin, and another billion years from there for photosynthetic life to become common enough to make an oxygen rich atmosphere.  That's 2 billion years of stagnate progress we can bypass because such life has already developed back on Earth and we can simply import it.  From there the environment was already suitable for humans (more or less) and the remaining 2 billion years was once again evolution (spurred by some mass extinctions). (The evolution time scale he gives is much shorter because humans can use technology to compensate for our deficiencies while evolution catches up, so less of us die off, accelerating the process somewhat.) The biggest problem to all of this is probably the toxic soil. I know of no existing technology that can clean an entire planet's soil of these toxins.
25 hours a day???!!?? What!!!??
2:38 what is that song?
Elon Musk: :)
I expected MatPat
9:48 25 hours a day? xD
Now I have to watch you and Quill; NICE :)
I needed this for Revalidtion But YOUR TO SLOW
One ‚òùÔ∏è question do you get demonized for saying Theory
Did you just play an excerpt from Dvorak‚Äôs NEW WORLD symphony in your video about terraforming a planet? You sure did, and I love you for that üëç
Why not try being in the same video as Mattpat, Austin
Dear Austin 
It‚Äôa meeeeeeeeeeeeeee insainraven
When are we gonna find out who has the most bank in all of video games I need to know
Never go to sfia just th√© vid√©o titles are gonna give you heartattacks
I want to see your playthrough of this game.
wtf do you mean we've never terraformed a planet before? We've been doing it for centuries.
why not also send a lense enhancer that can magnify the powers of the solar radiation to make the solar panels work more efficiently or a lens tube that is connected to the magnet?
1:30 Be careful with Japan they reproduce quick.
Loving the ZZ Tops easter egg.
Fish!
I mean... First!
How about solar panels on the satellite?
Make Mars Great Again! ‚ù§
LIFE THEORY!
Yessssss
First, Ashura's Wrath, second! this game kinda reminds me an old SimCity like game called Life on Mars? (yeah with the interrogation quotation and all) because its EXACLY like that game but way more advanced and cool, and im a big fan of this kind of games so i will check it out since Life on Mars isnt aviable anymore or you just can get the demo only and its for a freaking Win 95 machine! and i cant even started on Win 7 so yeah, good ep Austin as always and really neat game!
I love Dvorak!
song at 14:09 ?
What happened to the ritchest video game carictor? I wanna know. (Sorry for my English.)
we could get the power via a plasmic neutron fusion reactor
Hay Austin! I started playing VRChat a while ago and I thought it might be cool to do a video on how you can change your DNA to become a different avatar, or in my case... Ugandan Knuckles.
First time I saw anyone use the COD Advanced Warfare intro:0
Was going through steam discovery queue while starting this show.
This game showed up on there.
I am convinced that Valve and Paradox want me to buy this game.
.... Let's do it.
Look, I knew this wasn't gonna be a DOOM video, but how dare you tease me with my favorite game
Hey, Austin have you read/seen the expanse. The talk of Lagrange points and terraforming reminded me of it
Please do a episode on Luigi‚Äôs side special in super smash bro‚Äòs ultimate. Like so he can see!
I love how Fur Elise by Beethoven is playing during the segment where you mention copper.
I LOVE THIS GAME cant believe it showed up here
I'm something of an amateur astronomer and I gotta say, this was a very well researched episode!
Just curious, I'm taking a course on YT basically and I just want to know how much you made from the sponsor alone
Run away to the moon instead until mars is ready for colonization
I'd honestly rather terraform Venus, since it's about the same size as Earth, though you'd need to tame the runaway greenhouse effect and speed up it's spin XD
Ffs I‚Äôm disappointed. I thought it was gonna be about Sam Tyler in the hit BBC show ‚ÄúLife on Mars‚Äù. This is not epic
I just realized that if we can figure out when the core of Mars died, we could figure out when the core of Earth may die.
We could use a huge solarwing and place it on top of Mar to melt the Ice
of course we can run a power plant 25 hours in one day
I just realized GameLab was dead ;-;
I can't be the only one that skips Austin episodes.
You heard it here first!! Solar winds travel at a whopping 2.5 kilometres per hour!! Someone get MatPat in here to do a majora‚Äôs moon type episode on why they‚Äôre not deadly!!
Soooo Mars is not a giant spaceship that smashed many Irken ships? 


Ok...
Is that pictures of ZZ top in the solar shield at the La grange point?
Dude!  You didn't do a crossover with Isaac Arthur!

FOR SHAME, AUSTIN, FOR SHAME!!!
WHAT ABOUT SAVING OPPY FIRST (AND SPIRIT DONT FORGET SPIRIT)
I thought this was gonna be about how Elon Musk would make Mars survivable!!ü§£ü§£
This is the type of sponsored content I can get behind.
yo this is the same music Exub1a uses cool
Matpat did a video just like this but on film theory
Wow who knew humanity knew how to heat up a planet
Nice video and awesome use of the OST from Asura's Wrath.
HEY! That money should have been mine! :( I totally explained Lagrange points too. Ok fine, you can have it this time, but I'm watching you!üßê
If we all travel to Mars, doesn't that make us the aliens?
‚Äú25 hours a day‚Äù ‚ÄîAustin, 2019
Couldn't we just nuke it to solve the problem?
Use a Dyson sphere to generate the power for the Mars anti-solar wind shield
Saving this video for later for a campaign that basically uses the orbital magnetic field generator (as I had called before realizing it was theorized before)
Yall ever read/watch the Martian
You don't deal with Earth's problems first. That's a Sisyphean task if ever one existed. No, you divide your efforts and get to work on the future things now. The people doing that will either develop things that help Earth too or not be people who would be involved in the Earth-based efforts anyway, so it won't slow anything down, and it will give the human race a head start on finding a new apartment.
Don't let cool terraforming science distract you from the fact that Austin still has yet to reveal who the wealthiest video game character is
Man from 2130: ‚ÄúRemember back when earth was the only planet that was populated by humans... yeah... those were the days...‚Äù
He played the game for 6 days.





Austin really likes games, huh?

Fun fact: The T-1000's (antagonist of terminator 2) badge says 'Austin'.
I live in Wyoming. What's that you say about Yellowstone, it hasn't erupted in millions of years. 
Back of my mind: Every day Yellowstone doesn't erupt, the odds of it erupting today go up.
I'd personally LOVE to see a video based all around explaining Lagrangian points.
I like how the La Grange point just has a tiny PNG of ZZ Top in it
Austin: We need to warm this planet up
My answer: space heaters. Lots of space heaters
"You guys stop having so many babies I can only build so fast!" - Austin

This quote is the one problem newly fathers have to deal with.
I would be concerned about this megolomaniac outburst, but it's Austin.

Austin's the best!  

Besides, I wouldn't mind being a bionic human...
GODDAMMIT!  I told you to hold the radiation on my terraforming!  Now my children are glowing üò∞...
I saw this video, saw that Austin enjoyed it, and immediately bought the game. Expect vids on my channel soon
If you can make all that, why not just fix the earth?
NASA ,get them on your team







Oh wait it a game
How about you play oxygen not included. Pretty much the same idea but more cartoony
I once asked Austin on Twitter to make a video about Destiny's Traveller capacity to Terraform places like Venus in Destiny 1 and Nessus in Destiny 2. If he took almost a full 20 min to talk about Mars Terraformation, imagine the length of the video if he adressed what I suggested hahahaha
What is the name of the music that plays throughout the video I could listen to it for hours?
More Invader Zim references, heck yeah XP
5:56 I have no idea how but I perfectly understood him
Guys he's trying to make us forget about the richest videogame character videos
Did I just hear that wrong there is 25hours in a day guess I‚Äôve been doing it wrong all this time.
Paradox did you comment on n60sean newest video and was also pinned!
8:41 but doesn't that mean 1m in only 20 years, and only a tenth of a nuclear reactor power?
Also lichen would help with ecological succession, because you know, there‚Äôs no vegetation so need that stuff
You didn‚Äôt even say how to build up the atmosphere only how to let us do it in the first place
nobody will survive life on mars...or earth for that matter.
This seems like something a NASA video should cover, not something for a game channel.
Bingo, bongo, your atmosphere's gone-o
At the beggining I thought it was DOOM but its not which is sad
Everytime we mathmaticly have the ability to play God. We always fall short in power production. Fusion power really is the future.
Run the nuclear reactors 25hrs a day? Are we talking mars days or earth days or what?
If there‚Äôs sole wind we should make space baits that run off of them
AND the heating up of the Mexican Republic
I like the idea of moveing a dwaf plant in to an elliptical orbit. That close in elliptical orbit could jump stat mars core with tidal force.
9:56 and run them 25 hours a day hmmm seems legit
Ok fine then we start now. Also maybe it‚Äôs time for a dead cells video.
Free weekend on steam. If any one is curious.
I have wondered many times however, is it possible to actually (simplified) "reignite" Mars' core, or is this something that is completely the realm of science fiction ?
You shouting that people need to stop having so many babies is frankly hilarious!
I just bought this game and have not played it yet...
@12:00 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶um, you do realize that you spent over half of this video trying to solve the magnetic felid problem by building a magnet to work as a sheild from the sun's radiation, so that it wont strip away Mars's new atmosphere, right?

So now you want to use Greehouse gasses (which requires solar radiation to begin with) to warm the surface of Mars‚Ä¶

Okay, dude, I think that you're accidentally and inadvertantly proving why a large chunk the Creation Myths are far more believable than the big bang.
0:20

Downward Spiral
Austin starts speaking
Me: oh, boy....I hope his voice survives okay.
Also me: YES! DRIVE THE LITTLE MAN INSANE, YOU ILLOGICAL GAMES! MOOAHHAHAHAAAA!!!
You think that is hard. Just wait until you have to calculate in the fluctuations of solar radiation and cosmic background radiation into the figures as well.
I hope i die before global warming becomes an actual huge problem
OoooOooHhHHhh the time in the room matched the video exactly...
Question I'm sure I'm not the only one  who said this already but can't we  Modify the plant and get more results out of the plant that are modify but I might be wrong
We don't have to worry about the volcano under Yellowstone... it won't erupt any time soon.
Makes me wonder if Austin is still talking about this game...
These videos make my day so much better X)
If we want to be serious about space exploration setting up a colony on the moon is probably the best starting point but politicians are too greedy and stupid to do it
üôÅ I like The other guy better Who talks on this
Wheres my the SCIENCE of pikuniku?
they need to put total recall reference  or monument on mars the original not the remake
As I watched this Xbox let me download this for free in gamepass
Seriously no offense to Austin but I like mat pats vids WAY better.and why doesn‚Äôt he make his own channel?


This is just an opinion so please don‚Äôt take this seriously.
So Mars has a mass of ~0.11 Earth and a surface gravity of ~0.38 g.  Side effects of prolonged exposure to such an environment includes but is not limited to:
Loss of muscle mass
Decreased bone density
Impaired organ functions and blood circulation
Calcium entering the bloodstream leading to kidney  stones
An inability to return to Earth without years of physical therapy
Countless psychological issues due to the distance and inability to properly communicate with Earth

A bad time in general...

I mean, unless you're into that kind of stuff
I wish he showed the music he uses in these videos. Because I recognize the music during the ‚Äúhow to make a breathable atmosphere‚Äù scene but I can‚Äôt remember the name and I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS!!! Austin or someone please tell me
13:58, no.  pLaNtS CrAvE GaToRaDe IdIoT
Please remember to take action against the climate crisis and environmental  breakdown today fellow humans
He wore a MABA hat... I needed this. XD
Add more iron to the core restart the heating process with added gravity from added mass
The Game Theorists: We've got to warm this planet up somehow.
Humanity: Hold my beer.
1:14 


ZIM


 VS


AUSTIN  



WHO WILL WIN THE TITLE




 OF 1# INVADER ????
Better idea... fix Mar's moon. The gravity starts spinning the planet faster, CO2 on the whole surface gets tossed up, the core re-ignites and the planet slowly starts becoming habitable again in about 20 years.
"Warming planets is our specialty!" Not something to be proud of, Austin lol
Scientists are actually planing on making the moon livable for humans by or starting in 5 years
These kind of videos always make me so sad at the state our own planet is in.
I really appreciate the fact the the time clock on the wall of the ‚Äúrecording studio‚Äù actually matched up with the in video time. Hahah
U know that there‚Äôs probably just a simpler solution that works faster that we just aren‚Äôt considering and is like... right around the corner right?
Is it weird that I was watching this video while playing surviving mars.
how about create a giant (transparent) shield around the world. Seems to solve the atmosphere problem
I still say we need to colonize the moon first if we want to get anywhere close to colonizing mars
i genuinely loved this video good work man.
Seriously get upset whenever it‚Äôs not Matpat sorrynotsorry am out.
Hey Austin, I have a request. You‚Äôve done quite a few videos on the unreal strength of some characters. Why not see how strong the some of characters of For Honor must be in order to lift each other off the ground with their weapons, let alone their bare hands. Shugoki can puny-god slam an opponent like they‚Äôre a sack of feathers, Black Prior can lift and toss several enemies over their shield at once, and other characters can simply heave each other into the air with their weapon or send one another flying across the battlefield with their weapon. How?! How strong would they have to be to accomplish such feats of strength. Please make a video on this subject.

P.S. How, despite being covered head to toe in armor and carrying a halberd, is the Lawbringer capable of running the same speed as somebody as lightly equipped as Aramusha.
Aren't water and methane both rather effective greenhouse gases themselves?
9:56 nice little detail there, good on you!
Austin is the chaotic evil super villain that exists within us all
There is a pro-life ad in front of your video and I am curious your opinion on the matter
Quick! Someone show this to Elon Musk!
Surviving Mars? More like surviving boredom. This game is boring af. I rather play Destiny as a midgit Elf while high on pcv...
"Stop making babies I can only make buildings so fast"
- Austin 2019
SSneaky: pack up mysticans we going to mars.
wait aww my request has ben revoked. aww no fun
So, what if we built thousands of smaller space super magnets spread out in a grid...couldn‚Äôt that save power and metal?
Austin: 13:36
Also Austin: we know how much CO2 there is on Mars down to the ton
Hello Austin this is N.A.S.A. We‚Äôre working out ways to colonize Mars and your making some breakthrough in this video you‚Äôre hired
It honestly blows my mind that he gets timers like the one at 5:45 spot on every time. Nice job, Austin
14:06 MUSIC DOES ANYONE KNOW?? PLEASE IF YOU KNOW REPLY I LOVE THAT MUSIC!
If I didn't know Martian days were longer, that 25 hrs a day would have thrown me way off. XD
Alternatively, you could just get an ancient celestial ball to do all the hard work for you
Hi MatPat! I also have a theory question thing, and it's undertale again sorry. Um who is the river person? And why would he  worn Frisk about Gaster? I think that the river person IS Gaster. What do you think?
When you started playing dvorak I could not concentrate on the vid it is one of my favorite pieces
If we can't live in mars soon couldn't we just make life that we sent to mars evolve enough to be intelligent
Just send some genetic manipulated cockroaches to mars xD
[Elon Musk has entered the chat.]
9:56 nice little detail there, good on you!
It's the guy that screams, disliked.
So what I'm hearing is that, to live on Mars, we gotta start doin what on earth we're tryin to stop doin.
I‚Äôm your 15K like.
I'll just stick to Terraforming in minecraft
9:56 i think you ment 24 hours a day
I bet Elon Musk just watched this and was like, ‚ÄúWrite that down, write that down!‚Äù
Aaaahhhh.
"New world symphony"
4th movement I believe.
Quite fitting.
Austin is my favourite creator of this channel, and I worry about him every time XD
Well peace out guys. I‚Äôm going to Marsüëçüèª‚úåüèª
Do more dark deception on gt live. It`s pure "learning gold"
You've got some Doom on your video but it's okay, it happens to everyone.
Playing mars from the suite of the planets... smh Austin... not very subtle
Wait, so depending on the situtation, co2 is good and oxygen is the A-hole?
Ohh look at a game called terragenesis, its about colonizing different planets and it think nasa made some of it
7:41 y u change music? I actually prefer these videos with that music. Just saying.
what is the song that plays for the second half of the video?
I like this game. But the meteor rains are anoying lol
the sun is like a toddler
and mars is the unmolested dandelion in the field
I wonder what Elon Musk would think about this
25 hours a day... That seems tricky
Is paradox interactive‚Äôs logo a platypus
Austin begins his conquest of Mars today...
i just finished reading the martian coincidence i think not
Love these type of Game Theory videos.
asdfex creates an arrow pointing right on the American keyboard, and since the immediate letter that arrow is pointing at is ‚ÄúG‚Äù, I say their name is not actually asdfex, but instead G. Boom case closed, minds blown, I‚Äôll take my Nobel prize now.
I kid you not I was so excited for a doom theory and them he said Surviving Mars and I was like tf
It was a really great episode though so thanks
"Fortunately, warming planets is our specialty"
Bruh.
100 Decibel Soundwaves: exists
Austin: Ah, a fine addition to my collection
At 6:00 the clock in the tip right is about a quarter of a second off and it annoys me TREMENDOUSLY
We always ask about life on mars.

But we never ask about mars on life?
I'm not saying that it was doom guy, but it was doom guy!!
Loved the video as always Austin! Been watching back since the OG Shoddy Cast days and my god it's safe to say you've gotten even better at what you do! Keep being awesome, I'm super hyped for the next video!
Matpat, can you find out the truth of danganronpa V3 and tell us your theory?
I think you forget that the more we manufacture and experience things economies of scale, mastery, and alternative solutions develop. Didn't Thomas Jefferson think colonizing America would take 400 years?
25 hours a day 



Are you ok Austin
wait, for the nuclear power solution, wouldnt they just melt down in space with no real way to dissipate their heat into the vacuum of space or is there something im missing about nuclear power?
11:38 OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH that's going to start some fights in the comments.
11:37
OH...OH NO
it's true tho
I feel like the best usage of Mar's space should purely be for developing energy purposes and the planet shouldn't be inhabitated (with maybe the temporary exception of people needed to manage the energy systems). If we were able to use an entire planet for solar farms, wind farms(?), and nuclear power plants, it could be a way to significantly reduce our contributions to our own atmosphere, ourselves, and the planet at large.
Yes it's easier to Terra form a planet then fixen this one, earth for future people whom might live on else where
it's easier to terraform the planet earth than to do it on Mars
No i dont want this i WANT MATPAT
Keep farting back to earth üòÇüòÇ
Now I understand Bezos position with regards to moving heavy industry off the planet. We are definitely way overdoing it with the whole global warming thing here on earth, but if mars had the kind of pollution that earth has... it would ironically become habitable, contrary to what its doing for us.
I kind of want this game now
For those interested in this topic, I strongly suggest you watch the channel Isaac Arthur. Perhaps try starting with his colonizing mars episode. His channel is practically defined by large scale, but still physically possible projects.
You should make a theory about doom
MatPat love your videos keep up the good work! And for GT LIVE i would love for you to replay some of the games you have played. Like super mario party. IK that matpat is not the host for This video but i am never early so i just wanted to get it said
"How the hell did the Japanese Emperor Sotuko's curse spread to youtube?" You may ask.

One word!
Does that mean Superman is only 43% as powerful on Mars if his base solar charge from Earth is depleted?
You gave me math, like way too much of it; and a problem that is hard to solve. >< now for the rest of work day my desk and phone is going to be full of equations and hypothesis. >< thank you. ^^
I'm surprised and glad that there arent people here complaining about his use of global warming. I'm so proud of this community.
Austin, nitrogen gas just like oxygen consist of two atoms so N2 not N
Okay i have to ask why and how dont you work at NASA?
Its off by .223 seconds when you see him at 5:50
there is a lot of radioactive elements in the core helping keep the core hot
That's not how you terraform Mars you put your hand on that silly three finger thing and then magic clouds come out and boom you're done
Zz Top inside the electromagnet at the lagrange point.
I really appreciated that Dvorak!
Sex is great bu what if Austin's name started with a B?
The heat also comes from radioactive particles.
This looks to be a much better of a game then the VR ‚Äúexperience‚Äù of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù, The Martian. Great book and movie but bad VR game.
what music is he using near the end of the video?
Did anyone else catch 25 hours a day?
Should Of Been Markiplier In The Thumbnail
I've heard somewhere that we could reactivate the magnetic field on mars by blowing a nuclear bomb in the nucleus of the planet
Elon musk wants to know your location
AnUniverseStartsToInventNarwals  But what this means? Means ¬°¬°¬°AUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSTIN!!!
Hopefully they do a Venus expansion/new game.
Is this hyping a new channel called ‚ÄúLife theory‚Äù???
This is by far the best add i ever seen
Why ? 
Because he showed us how many hours he played so i looks like he genualy liked the game and its not just a cash grab
"C02 trees love it!" Me: TREES, TREES, TREES!
WHY IS THE VIDEO PLAYING BLACK SCREEN ONLY?! I PLAYED SO MANY FACKING VIDEOS AND ALL OF THEM SHOW ONLY BLACK SCREEN WTF?!! SoMEONE SEND HELP!!
Why colonize Mars. Venus is much easier.
"thankfully, as you may or may not know, warming planets is our specialty."
Austin, why don't we just throw Mercury at Mars like how Earth collided with its twin planet in the early solar system to increase its mass, surface temperature and gravity
what if u can't judge somebody cause someone's world is better?
At 13:55 what is the background music?
i like the idea of using legrange points, but there's one big problem. they're too unstable for something to stay there for a prolonged period of time
Hope you like dust... üëç
I saw that thing about using greenhouse gasses to make mars warmer at the space and rocket center.
Elon Musk Joined the chat.
Thumbnail is me taking a dookie
Is that New World Symphony
I have a question though... How would you keep out the UV-C? Or is Mars far enough away that it isn't harmful anymore? (it's a real question, I'm not being a prick. I really love the video!)
When he just rants but sounds so happy, it sounds like he's going insane üòÇ



Edit: omg thank u guys sm for the likes ;w; ‚ù§
I've been researching how to colonize Titan for school. Ironic timing.
"Earth looked like a half gone mars then BAM" 



Creationists 
Giving Austin the benifit of the doubt he's 2,499,997 kph off. Am i the only one who was confused by this.
Also(I know we can't change this but still) what about the gravity. Wouldn't it be way less.
When you're such a choir nerd, you were too busy singing along to Verdi's "Dies irae" in the beginning of the video, that you had to rewatch it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Austin, you could stop frickin world hunger, and you do THIS?!?!
2:00 you havent met Stellaris widows...


Also, my favorite way to get a Magnetic field on mars is to NUKE THE CORE!!! SHOOT LAZERS INTO THE CORE! MAKE IT SO GOD DAMN HOT DOWN THERE! 
25 hours of huh??? I thought a day was 24 hours long
U just made my day so much better matpat
Austin, you have great taste in music
WHO!
IS!
THE!
RICHEST!
‚ÄúIs there life on Mars!‚Äù
What if we nuke the ice caps now and then wait
Did I just watch an 18 minute ad?
cant you genetically modify the trees??
3:29 not quite. There is a lot of energy left from when the planet formed, but it would have cooled by now if that were the only source. A substantial amount of the heat is from the decay of radioactive elements, that's what has kept it hot for so long.
The mars chocolate bar or the real thing
Elon musk liked this video
What‚Äôs the name of the piece he plays when talking about making the atmosphere breathable?
I thought this was about to be the science of doom but that was a twist
Elon Musk wants to know your location
Dear Austin. I, have a question. How does time work in the game Geist?

In case you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the GameCube game called Geist.

You're gonna need more üíä for this Science.
9:56 "...and run them 25 hours a day..." I assume that's not Earth-time?
why is your voice so loud even when my sound is really low XD
No offence <3
The dramatic classical music in the background is very annoying.
Where have you been?
But more importantly, where is your richest video game characters pt. 2?!
Austin you didn‚Äôt mention your baby in this episode what the hell man
5:54 man but wanted to know üò≠
The beginning clips in The video are from Doom 2016
Before I watch the video, I'm, going to make some educated guesses about how to do the thing
STEP 1: Speed up the rotation of Mars to increase gravity.
STEP 2: inject iron into the core to increase the magnetic field. 
STEP 3: Melt the ice caps to increase surface water, atmospheric gasses, and surface temperature. 
STEP 4: Increase the temperature of the surface to a livable level by getting a lot of dark spots laid out to absorb heat from the sun. 
STEP 5: Introduce nitrogen to the soil to improve its current fertility.
STEP 6: Start Colonizing.
The game is also on Xbox Game Pass.
Nice Video, but i think you forgot the two moons of Mars. I believe they are so close to the planet that creating a dense athmosphere would result in friction for the moons and therefore the slow but sure  slowing down of those moons, wich would result in Armageddon for mars
There may be a simpler solution to the magnet satellite issue: instead of building only one (oversized) magnet at L1, build  additional magnets tethered to the (smaller sized) L1-Magnet that cover the border area at much lower cost.
The Martian teaches you how to survive on Mars.....
AUSTIN!!
I have a question. :)
Is there a way to donate to a patreon that will allow us to essentially give you a video to make??
There's been a question roaring at the back of my mind for ages.

Is it even possible to for humans to live on other planets?
I mean you already mentioned the fact that Mar's gravity alone could cause problem but what about if we couldn't exactly duplicate Earth's ecology?
Wouldn't that essentially cause bacterias to form that we aren't evolved to deal with thus bringing disease like the Spanish in the first years of arriving in the Americas.

Even if you could only give me a maybe a link or a place to start with doing my own research I'd really appreciate it.
I haven't had any luck and this has been a question for years.
I love you, your videos, and everything you do!
Sincerely,
Chris :)
At one point you said to run two nuclear power plants 25 hours a day, not 24 hours which is the length of a day so either you made a mistake in your script or are you adjusted for the time difference based on the distance from the sun and just didn‚Äôt mention it
Don‚Äôt take any offence I‚Äôm just a nerd and I like you videos
Austin: 25 hours a day
9:56
25 hours a day!
25 hours a day?
would you believe me that when i learn nee physics in school i see a video in here about it (neat an i right?)





p.s. i ment magnets
Dear Austin,

I love your show BUT


I can't say that I don't enjoy it every time You upload.
Sincerely Alva Tobias B.
Omg, Austin, I didn‚Äôt recognize you, I love when you start off my screaming
Mars isn't that bad! How dare you call it that, it's beautiful. And homely
Was worried about fighting the citizens of hell for a second
If our magnetic field is from iron, then how does the sun have one?
When you reconise the background music( dies irae requium 3rd movement)
I am so happy that you used the Hunter hunter phantom troupe theme in this video Austin!
What if paradox just use's him to improve there game
Whats the name of the song playing around 3 minutes in?
What about the tiny 40% earth gravity? I don't think the low gravity Would be good for people either
You should do a theory to see if it in possible to survive off of nothing but banana (Fortnite season 9 trailer)
I don‚Äôt know if that was a joke but Austin said 25 hours a day
Dis you know that there is a boardgame called terraforming mars. In that you try to terraform mars for human life
The real questions are did Austin tape himself playing this game and if so, where can I watch him play this game for 165 hours?
Pushes glasses back up from the end of my nose Actually the heat from the core of our planet come mostly from the decay of radioactive material.
What is the music from 14 minutes?
me, an intellectual that read The Martian 4 times: just farm potatoes
YES AUSTIN!!!
Always love this game.
10:03 "We can finally protect Mars using the powers of SCIENCE!"


Reminder that Invader Zim destroyed Mars
I wish he actually explained everything
You can kickstart the magnetic field by slamming a meteor on it
Yo, Austin, you wanna collab on this game?  I'm so up for it.
And THEN there's the issue of culling out the Cyber Demon outbreak and... wait, wrong game again...
>suspected communist creates massive food shortage and death when put in charge of economy
Really makes me think
I think i ruined austins theory cause cant we just dig a cave support the cave then make all of the stuff except the giant electromagnet and boom inhabitable area
Judge us from up High? Based off of what you said literately the sentence beforehand, it sounds more like you'd be doing your judging from below.
‚ÄúYou foools‚Äù
Paradox Interactive: We cancel
Warming planners is our speciality :) I agree it‚Äôs the one thing humanity is good at
I was so excited to see a doom episode but my hopes where crushed
Nice I was discussing this with a whole bunch of friends so ima send it to them. Nice to know somebody did the math
I'm fully aware Austin wasn't talking to anyone about lagrange points and it was a bit to explain why he couldn't explain them but he seemed so disappointed that' he didn't have time to talk about them that I want him to make a video on it now :/
Whats that piece that plays when hes talking bout trees
Where the hell is gaming‚Äôs richest 2? It seems like you‚Äôre avoiding it.
Also stop the SDF
9:56 did you just say 25 hours a day?
power the coil with antimatter batteries
9:57 TWENTY FIVE HOURS A DAY
Rip and Tear until it is done.
There‚Äôs only one thing that can help you to survive on Mars:

Elon musk wants to know your location
Well I found a new game to disappear into....
Also.....still waiting on the continuation of which game makes you the most buck!!!
I honestly love the games that are city builders from paradox, they are so well done
‚ÄúBall we live on‚Äù 
This interpretation is perfect.
Isn‚Äôt there a bacteria that produces oxygen as a byproduct of breaking down iron oxide to gain energy
(granted we‚Äôd need to supply it with the materials it would need to reproduce)
Colonizing Mars is cool, but I think humanity's major priority should be genetically engineering cat girls.
5:45 the timer in the background is actually on point with the video's actual timer
BLUE TEXT IM ALREADY READY FOR HI IT'S ME AUSTIN
Damn if only humans could‚Äôve been alive a few million years ago
Anyone else literally playing surviving mars while watching this video?
Stephen Hawking is rolling in his graveüò•
Terraforming mars, well as long as you don't use moss and cockroaches you should be fine
Would the gravity be different on mars
Hah, 25 hours a day, I get it! That's a Martian day isn't it?
9:57  "25 hours a day" which is close to how long a solar day is on mars.
Mars is a great analogy for a spunky person in their twenties. Had a hard job and was constantly yelled at by their boss, but was super cool and energetic. Soon as that ran out, though, the pressure got to them and they died inside.
wait 25 hours a day my life is a lie
They came to you specifically because of your show. You don't pull any punches and research the heck out of everything you do. They trusted that you would call them out on anything that they did wrong, probably updating if anything was off, and its like when MatPat researched World Of Tanks. If you can't find any viable flaws in their game, then that just means its a good game that really did its research.
I‚Äôm sorry, SURVIVING MARS?!




HOW ABOUT DOOM
I like the use of new music like Humoresque at 7:00
How to survive Paradox DLCs next please
Perfect choice to use Dvoraks "From the new world" as background music :D
So what your saying is that we need to hurry the hell up and get that going.
‚ÄúOh we talked about magnets too long? Well okay‚Äù
Question about the satellite shield idea: wouldn't the gravity of the earth, moon, and venus interfere with that?
Just put the magnet between the stationary point between Venus and Earth and line it up with Mars. Then you need much less magnet.
5:40 Lagrang 1 Lagrang point, brought to you by the department of redundancy department.
I love watching these videos, they are enjoying and I get to learn something new everytime. Keep up the great work!!
Honestly that's the best ads ever, I rly want to buy this freaking game now
3:30 I thought a good part of the heat was due to radioactive decay.
What about somehow adding enough mass to increase the planet's gravity? Or creating an artificial gravity field?
But what about getting the correct soil and nutrients for the plants?  And taking it from earth would make earth a bit less habitable wouldn't it?
what if on the first part you reheated the core?
I feel like one would do better with floating cities and Venus.
I just watched The Martian in class today
"25 hours per day" - 9:58
Elon Musk probably clicked on this
I saw Doom 4, I was hooked.
everyone else: Lets go to Mars!!! WOO COLONY!! 
me: Thank GOD they finally left!!!!
wouldn't the lack of nitrogen screw you over in all of this? 

plants and bacteria wont do crap without it
How to survive life on Mars?

Just play as Doom Slayer
Pretty ironic that nuclear weapons propuce a "mushroom cloud" and actual fungus are resiliant to radiation. . .
Can you do one on taitanfall 2, mostly on scorch's thermal shield. It is able to negate damage by melting projectiles in midair. It is even strong enough to melt a railgun shot in midair. Would that much heat set everything nearby on fire?
How about you have a second show explain science in our own world and going over how it works?
The sun won't strip the atmosphere away instantly if we give it an Earthlike pressure. It'd take geologic timelines to erode to its current pressure. Pleeeeenty of time to work out and build a more permanant solution, as suggested in the video. 

Before that point, we could just protect colonies with smaller magnetic fields, but the atmosphere does protect from some radiation on its own.
Magnets go from North to south... Your image is wrong.
@gametheroy I just wanna let you know that there is anti abortion ads on this video.
Global Warming? Nonono. Mars Warming
Only if you don‚Äôt meet shaggy.
14:10 Can anyone tell me where is this music from?
MOOAR AUSTIN!!!
kph lol, more like km/h
9:56 wait wait wait wait... did he say 25 hours!?
As i know the Venus was the Planet who looked like the earth. The interesting part is that the warmth of the sun is increasing and not decreasing. So the Mars had never life and is forever cold. But im not an scientist, so i cannot denie life on Mars.

Sorry, bad englisch.
Edit: I don't mean possible life that traveld to it...
If we melt co2 ice to heat the planet, the co2 will heat the rest of the ice but how do we stop the heating?
Suicide rates would get higher because it's easier all they have to do is go outside.
needs more makes no god damn sense.
wait did he say 25 hours a day
He was trying to talk about doom wasn't he?
Ya I too work for 25 hours a day 9:53
2.5kph i didnt notice it at the start, read the disclaimer and literally died!








imagine 1,5 mln miles equating to 2.5 km, dang america would be small and does particals would be going slower than grandma
‚ÄúIf we can turn Mars into Earth, then we can turn Earth back into Earth‚Äù- Neil DeGrasse Tyson
Didn't you do this episode before over on film theory?
Just some thoughts from yr11: if we want to make the magnetic field stronger we could Insert a core Inside the coil.
Austin, question regarding the first problem.
What about reheating the core of Mars? How hard would it be compared to the one you ended up within this video? And what options would be have to achieve this?
We‚Äôre never going to find out who is the richest video game character, are we.
200-500 years !?!?!? we have less than 20 years to start slowing down global warming. sorry i need to go plant some trees and recycle my trash.
Dang it Austin, why not do a video on a LEGO game, or do more of the "Who's Makin' Bank" videos that you still have to make?!!!!!
You should do a collaboration with because science
I hope you see this Austin, I just wanted to suggest a theory on red dead redemption 2 and how the dead eye mechanic works because you can completely turn around in seconds and the bullets (I would think) are moving faster. Hope you see this and at least consider it, love the vids!
insert  angry comment about where the riches video game person  part 2 is
Austin, thank you SO much for covering the one issue I have with terraforming Mars. I don't know how many arguments I've gotten into with a friend of mine because he's completely overlooked the lack of a magnetic field. He seriously believes we can just dump carbon dioxide and plants on Mars and call it a day.
Make who or what is Herobrine in Minecraft theory.
Idk anyone who thinks terraforming mars is an escape from climate change.  I've always heard it as a possible solution to running out of resources.  But given the challenges of the task it's likely  we would terraform small areas of the planet under protective shields.  Eventually expanding out those small communities to fill up the whole planet would take generations.  It's taken humans 10000 year or more to reach a population density that moving to other planets might be necessary.  We could cut that in half or even a quarter because of our current rate of expansion but that's still a long time.
why does no one ever talk about Venus? Sure mars may be a better place for temporary living but if we want to terraform, Venus seems like a MUCH easier place to do so. Plus with the higher surface gravity (91%!) it would be much much easier on our bodies. It already comes with a thick atmosphere that we could live in the upper parts of in the meantime as it would shield us from radiation, be the same pressure as earth, and be a somewhat reasonable 75 degrees c (yes this is a genuine idea published by NASA, Venetian cloud cites. It's called HAVOC). It's even geologically active, with volcanoes and tectonic plates just like earth. Lastly Venus is much closer to earth then mars, making it much easier and quicker to get there and back.
I appreciate the Dvorak!
At around 8 mins you used minecraft ingots, those were bronze, not copper
We can evolve faster than you think when exposed to harsh environments.
If we're going to Mars, we need to evolve into a low gravity creature. Instead of having our species evolve directly on the planet, overcompensate for the time it would take to evolve for Mars' gravity. Maybe on the year long ride to mars, some women are impregnated and have children in the weightless environment(the child has to develop in space during pregnancy and preferably a little while after). They would be more biologically capable of living on the planet than a child born there (probably)
HE MEANT TO SAY 25 HOURS A DAY!!!


A martian day (a sol) is over 24 and half hours, making it closer to 25 hours. It was a joke and it is flying over all of you guy's head.
This is the 7th Surviving Mars video I've seen today. PARADOX! Your marketing is actually effective and makes me want to buy it. Good job :-)
wait, if you create an atmosphere for mars, how would the core heat back up again?
Please stop writing kph. Its km/h and it really annoys me!
 Best regards your triggered German.
12:30  hahah, let's just redirect meteors. That's so easy!
What's the music that you play in the final seconds of the video?
if we built a Dyson sphere before we colonize Mars from Mercury then we might be able to just use the Dyson sphere for the power and just transmitted over to your coil and either way with the Dyson sphere we could probably colonize the entire solar system
Global warming is a myth. It's supposed to be water world right now and no polar bears.....10 years later and it's a total lie.
The game I have I Will get it and the space race
I need to ask matpat some questions!!!
So what you're saying is... bye Felucia.
No david bowie reference. Gg
Diy: Terraform Mars!
Thx u for uploading
FOOOLS!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
BFG Division starts playing
Song from 13:52 to end is dvorak "from new world"
4:13


Austin: 2.5 kph
Another solution to atmosphere prob is nuke it
This is the reason why we should take care of the Earth kids, it would literally take our entire lives to make Mars earth even a lot over but we can still save earth in our lifetime
Hey, wait a minute, wasn't this video supposed to have over 600k views within the first hour?



MatPat you  to me.
in reeeeeeely wanted doom as a video. :(
what about terraforming venus?
I know it's literally hell but at least it keeps its atmosphere
Plays Antonin Dvorak's 9th symphony which is called "New World"


I see what you did there.
Can you do Symmetra hard light powers from Overwatch?
I just want to know...

Is Clifford a Kaiju?
Playing new world symphony at my high school orchestra concert tonight
I first played this game last week and I just did this magnetic field stuff in physics I think he is stalking
No I know something better we can do to heat Mars. We just raise over 7 billion animals on the planet and they will rise the planets temp and be a source of food aka do what we‚Äôre doing on earth (source Cowspericy)
Mars... the recent target for invasion by a sadistic neigh unstoppable evil demonic overload...... So the Disney Corporation?

Does this mean mars has a crap ton of resouces?
Edit: ores and metals
Austin, I thought you were a smurt science boi. How and why did you light your atmosphere on fire!
Elon Musk Wants To Know Your Location
Damn, I thought this was gonna be a DOOM video
There's a lot of references to the unprovable story of evolution in this video, and you just had to throw global warming in there as well. So much for being completely scientific.
25 hours a day. Get it? Becouse we are further away from the sun, therefore having more hours in a day? Funny joke
Hey Austin!!! Hi, quick question over here, wouldn't it be counterproductive to first pump the planet full of CO2 and then putting plants in that'll get rid of it? I'm guessing it's one of those things you left out =) ... Love the show by the way, thanks for making it!
if autstin's videos had existed seven years ago, i might not have given up on science in high school
How much kinetic energy would it take to restart Mars‚Äô natural magnetosphere ? I mean, if bombarding the planet with comets and asteroids is an option, then Additional bombardment should eventually heat the core, right?
Came for Matpat, stayed for Austin
Last summer I calculated how much of everything would be needed to make a moon sized version of earth‚Äôs atmosphere. I also try a ton of different ways to find this before realizing I could just divide the diameter of the moon by the one of the earth. Then multiply the quantity of everything in earths atmosphere by that, and voila, many weeks of summer vacation are gone. RIP.
hey at least you made the game sound cool
hey guys, listen so lets make mars inhabitable by kind of destroying it
I'm gonna be honest, at this point I like austins videos more than mats, austins are more of for the sake of making something entertaining and scientific while matpats or more or less just sell outs on whatever is trending and selling merch, which is a valid strategy, but getting boring and bland pretty fast.
It's an awfully small affair to the girl with mousey hair
So the atmosphere route isn't looking too promising. Have you considered the mass electromagnet theory? The theory goes an electromagnet with enough power can be used to kickstart the molten core of a planet which is said to cause a radical environmental change and even alter the atmosphere in several years opposed to hundreds of years. Magnets man, that s**t is wonderful.
i thought this was about doom lol
Just bought it, heres hoping its good!
Wait... You guys get paid?
What is the name of the song at 14:00 to the end of the video?
25 hours a day clap clap


(The reactor part)
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped on to a war with the Cabal on Mars.Lets get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubikon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
Austin and Paradox, a collab I genuinely didn't see coming. This was cool.
How about:
The secret final of A hat in time?
Nice call making one of the background music pieces ‚ÄúMars: Planet of War‚Äù. I appreciate the small things few else probably noticed.
I laugh so hard when he said raising planet temperature was our specialty 





Just do global warming stuff as same on earth
Dude i have big question about undertale. How can a bed of flower lare your fall?
Your clock in the background is half a second behind and I hate it it drives me nuts
You should do a two parter on this about the affects on humans living on there and what could possibly be done to accommodate it
I need to bully these nerds some more. I demand Earth vs Mars wars for the lulz. Well that and Lagrange thingie sounds awesome.
I need to ask my science teacher if we can actually watch this in class because by the time I leave college we're doomed (and I mean by the time I'm 25 since I'm 13 so that's 12 years edit: nvm) and by the time we get to Mars do you think we can try and think of ways to save earth?
edit: WAIT WE CAN USE CYANO BACTERIA TO SAVE THE EARTH WE CAN THANK AUSTIN FOR SAVING THE EARTH
Anyone else suddenly subbed to this channel??
Well, if people had supported Nikola Tesla more in his time, you'd have death lasers to safely heat the planet with, but noooo...
Didn't recognize his voice in the beggining cuz he wasn't screaming
6:20 Does anyone else see Bert and Ernie in the space shield
Mat is the better than  Austin  like to agree comment to disagree
Where's the richest game characters two?
do vid abaut  dance granats
Or we can terra form Earth
It is stil habitable how hard could it be?
üò®
I know the song at 13:53, but i don't know its name. Anyone know?
9:18 so basically you‚Äôd need as much energy as the flux capacitor 1.21 GW
yes Austin finally! I've been waiting for you to play some Dvo≈ôak forever! I love the 9th symphony :)
I think the shield's power should be upped to 1,21 GW.
I thought the place was going to be doom
Hmm... this looks like a cool game.
Free Weekend Trial
Well I know what I'm doing now.
So we'd basically have to damage Mars in order to inhabit it...
Well, looks like corporates have a job to do!
Oi! Where's richest characters p.2?! (No hate, just really excited!)
would of been cool if you explained lagrange points but sped up so we could choose to slow down the video and see it, kinda like No more heroes did. 


oh and Great video!
Outlandish idea... I'm imagining a turbine in the atmosphere of Venus, spitting gasses out into a weird trajectory that lands it onto Mars.
Can we live on Mars?
NO!
Why?
THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER!
likes video even tho I don‚Äôt like Austin‚Äôs style of video its for BabyPat
I only subscribe to game theory for Austin he's way more science orientated
Question: where would the water on mars come from?
Too bad we didn't get to hear him explain the L1 point. :(
My last colony prior to Green Planet was a massive success. Multiple wonders, 2000 colonists, food, metals, only a few non natural deaths in the founder stage when I investigated a failed colony anomaly and some other country sabotaged my dome. That was the hardest blow right there.
He said 25 hours a day on 9:58
Yeah here is the thing about using a nuclear plant in space how the hell are you going to dissipate all that heat.
9:58 25 hours a day ???
Rust Dust & Guts is Mars' theme song
Short awnser 




No
I must congratulate you Austin, you made it through a whole episode without forming a black hole 
That deserves a clap and a half-
That last musical piece was New World Symphony (Symphony No. 9)  by Antonin Dvorak. Specifically part 4 (Allegro con fuoco).
I love how you used ‚ÄúThe New World Symphony‚Äù while talking about creating a new world
Why was I subscribed to this channel automatically by YouTube?
I'm suprised were working on surviving Mars even though venus is earth's closest cousin
Dang, an unskippable 19 minute ad? Wait...that was the video?
I swear I hear WWE UK champion Walter's entrance theme in this video
ELON MUSK WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
as a person who worked on the subject of terraforming mars (the research into the viable use of lichen ). i have no complaints on your presentation...GJ
Is this a David Bowie reference?
11:11 Hey we have almost as much atmospheric CO2 pressure as Mars!
wouldn't it be amazing if someone in the future used this video as inspiration?
might be a paid promotion but it really seems like you had fun with it. Good job
Heres a solution, replace the iron core with magnetised steel as it can be magnetised pernamently
Wait.. So this whole video is an ad?
But the heat the copper has to handle?
You want a bionic utopia play stellaris
Aren‚Äôt humans technically cancer for planets
Best sponsered vid ive seen in a long while
So this might be a completely stupid question, but what about placing bio domes on mars? Or even any other planet. Would that be a viable solution to the atmosphere problems?
0:09
Oh I thought you were talking about Doom lmfao

Edit: 2:30
Austin: I‚Äôm not an evil overlord

A few seconds later

Austin: step 1: BLOT OUT THE SUN
The fact that the problems of today are the solutions for martians is hilarious. 

Also, If anyones curious Surviving Mars is free to Xbox gold members.
Wow, this looks so achievable...
Humans really are lazy beings

Okay i just saw the end of the video nevermind
I find it interesting how the developers of Minecraft mods all just agreed on what copper should look like.
Thanks Industrialcraft, I guess.
Mars. Earth's twin. A green, livable, beautiful planet. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND it's gone.
I love how the LaGrange point is actually a photo of ZZ top, with the opacity lowered.
Every time Austin hosts a video
Me:dislikes the vid and leaves
I know it's literally called the "New World Symphony", but was that choice of music also a Legend of the Galactic Heroes nod?
CO2, huh... I'm an atmosphere that is already almost all CO2... I see...
My dream for you is for you to voice a Super Villain( like Ludo from star vs the forces of evil) so if I ever get superpowers be watching out for that üòÑ
Wouldn't living on Venus in balloon-cities be more feasible?
Please do a theory on how many safety regulations Wonder Park is breaking
why not just build a heavy duty "bubble" around mars to keep the air in it
now do a science theory video on [Changed]
Omg... I come here for THE SCIENCE and the first thing YouTube plays is an ad... About how climate change isn't real... "Because the world doesn't have a ceiling so how can it trap heat?"

My entire brain wanted to scream.
So if there is no magnetic field, there is no south and north, meaning... there are no poles.
Why was I automatically subscribed to this channel for some reason? Has this happened to anybody else?
Austin!!! I missed you homie! Keep shoddy alive
TTTT Austin, you're the only reason I'm suscribed to this channel -_-
Never thought we would need global warming one day




ON MARS!!!!
Jeez, paradox did their research!
How topical. Blade Runner is this year
11:11 Should be N2 instead of N :-)
Austin i think some scientist is going to steal all your ideas
Get it done in less than 12 years and we'll all be ok!
Dumb question Austin but why not just drill down into Mars's core and drop a few dozen nukes down there to warm things up again to restore its magnetic field? God knows we got plenty of extras here on earth that could be used for such an insane idea
49811th notification Squad!!!!!!! XD
And i thought you were talking Take on Mars
This game worth playing?
Just poop and farm potatoes. If Matt Damon can do it- so can you.
ELON MUSK WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
i love video hate music i get stress
I wish you were my teacher lmao
Didn‚Äôt y‚Äôall already do this with the martian?
Finally another interesting title, but Austin is the host, again. Where is Mat?
What happened to MatPat? :‚Äô(
Yay mars chan for the win
Well at the very least, if Mars doesn't work out, there are still other possibly inhabitable planets to head towards. Sure, we would have to create a human colony that could survive in space for the hundreds or so years it would take us to get there or take the Alien approach and put us in a cryo sleep. But hey, at least we have options.
spoilers btw 




smh
That was a really engaging yet informative video austin.. nicely done x


 Please keep doing what you are doing cos you're so damn good at it!
SOMEWHERE ON EARTH

How are we going to colonise Mars

I know, let‚Äôs watch game theory
Terraforming Mars? Check Isaac Arthur's videos for that. :)
So mine asteroids save on launches build solar mirrors. We got this.
Step 3 in my long term plan of establishing the principality of Zeon and invading the Earth with GIANT MECHS!!!!!
Man much better when you go more grazy in the video :D
I like the music choice!  Nice one, Austin!  What are the names of the songs that were used?
I‚Äôm gonna really miss our planet earth when the apocalypse makes it uninhabitable. Like this to stay with Earth-Chan for a few million more years.
Million, billion, what‚Äôs the difference xD, great video Austin
Really took it easy on em huh?
Why does everyone think that this all happen millions of year ago?
Mars Is Red
bingo bongo, no more congo on Mars
When ai take over your dead
So you're saying it's possible.
Hmmm...
0:07 
Me: America
Just bring Matt Damon.
Who is watching it in 2065 from Mars?
Anyone remember The Martian?
Stellaris is actually the paradox game where you make a bionic utopia built upon the bulging corpses of dead strangulated organic humans.
4:08 1,500,000 mph = 2.5 km/h?  My life is a lie
A National Geographics documentary didn't mention Solarwinds.
how am i randomly subbed to game theory again? i can clearly remembering unsubbing then this pops up in my sub box
Austin: I can't explain that
Austin: Goes on to explain that
200-500 years sounds actually doable considering it's terraforming an entire planet.
At the beginning I thought he would say Elon Musk "overlord" "conquer mars" its all there.
I've learned so much more in the first four minutes of this video than in ten years school. Thank you
Wow, that toddler-dandelion example was great! xD
He's never going to be cut loose to make his own videos and do his own thing, is he?  SIGH 
Could you AT LEAST mark his videos as separate to MatPats so I don't waste the click?  He's obnoxious.
5:45
I love that the timer is matched up with the video time!
I thought you meant DOOM  2016
Stop making babies! I can only build so fast
Terraforming is a horrible idea. Always build O'Neill cylinders if you want to colonise space. - Colonizing Mars mean: build those 'bubbles' (or tunnels really) Start mining operations. Build O'Neill cylinders in orbit. ... Never terraform a planet. That's totally a late game thing that you do NOT bother with until you have a good presence in space.
- Oh, and by now, you should have at least a couple of O'Neill cylinders in Earth orbit, and some space infrastructure, like at least one orbital ring.
Do no one question how we know that the inside of the Earth is hot? Like did someone driel  into. he soil and when there?
Another, probably not viable, solution to getting back Mars' magnetic field: NUKE THE HELL OUT OF THE CORE!

But where is the 
Dear paradox interactive
IT'S MEEEE
AUUUUSTIN
Cybernetics are definitely a smart move to survive outside Earth.
It's time to start building Noah's Astro Ark. We're going to Mars 2200!
why build a sheild just reheat the core bing bango
Austin what happened to your part 2 of who is the richest vedio game character
How to survive on Mars 

Step 1: Dont go
was excited to see how much it was and possibly buy it, but its steam, and untill theres a way to turn steam off after i have the game launched with keeping the game open but steam turned off, i wont use steam.
But with all the Lichen, dont you need silver weapons? teehee
Yay! 9:53 A random ARIZONA reference that doesn't have ANYTHING to do with our crazy politics!!! We're not complete losers! Take that Alabama!
Why not just do what we do best to warm up Mars and nuke it
The only time when global warming is useful
What about the quadraliens attacking our space stations
this is alot of space math...
I should try this game out

10:00 he said 25 hours a day
What about detoxifying the dirt?
Anyone notice that he is using the asuras wrath music at the 14 minute mark?
Austin, I bloody LOVE Youre use of Classic music in Youre vids!
A surviving Mars video! Yay! I love this game!
What's the music that starts playing at 2:37?

Actually, I'd love to know the name of all classical songs that play in the video. ^^;
Did anyone hear the Asura‚Äôs Wrath music in the background?üòÅ
i just noticed that the timer in the sounds room clips are dead accurate to the video's actual time.
i like that you use classical music in the background 
it perfectly opposes your additude in these videos
I have now started calling the magnetic field ‚Äúthe magnetosphere‚Äù
I just love austin for the music background
Still waiting on the Richest Video-Game Character...
But how often will a meteor or comet come to mars. if its not often, what would we use instead?
What if we MELT THE CORE!!!!
Ok , i will take the game , YOU GOT ME
No black hole this time?
What if we invent something that makes terraforming easy, or that humans master the art of space and time, and we van travel across dimensions, Then earth becomes so stable, that even without humans it would defend itself, xd.
omg! what is that music from that he was playing wile talking about making oxygen? Or rather, what anime was it in? I have initial D levels of Deja Vu when it started play about some very epic battle with smacktalking. Dx
wait...the world wasn't flat ?
Wait, Austin has a wife? Well, congrats on being married.
Is it ironic that today in school they literally just talked about how we could colonize Mars?
Dis hurts me brain ü§Ø
I like my idea better.  We strap rockets to IO, hundreds of thousands of them, as many as it would take, and we steal IO(a moon of Jupiter) from Jupiter and slam it smack, dead center, into Mars and wait for a couple hundred years for the surface of Mars to go from molten lava to solid rock again.


This should melt the core of Mars again, basically firing the forge back up, bringing the atmosphere generator back online.


In the meantime, while we wait for Mars' surface to cool back down, we can work on making our own planet, Earth more sustainable.
I feel like not a lot of people watch this series of Petscop, but I love it and I‚Äôm thankful for the amount of detail and work you put into these, thank you‚ù§Ô∏èüíö
Matpat: This is the end of petscop atleast according to this theorists
I swear I will NEVER get tired of MatPat's creepy psychopath voice
"Infinite Fun" puts scary background and scary music

SEGA:there we go.
0:23
That is the Spongebob font.
You thought I wouldnt notice.
Nice try, Mat.
Ok, so here is my theory on the name of Petscop's company, Garalina. Garalina is a fake word made up of "Gara" and "Lina." We know that Lina isn't a word, it's a name. In fact, it's Marvin's friends name.  "Gara" or "Gar" is a old word that means something like "fish." So if we put it all together, "Garalina" means "fishing for Lina." The company's purpose was to find out what happened to Lina Leskowitz. Hopefully I get credit for this.
look matpat,

whenever you say something is over it comes back

edit:1k likes.
alright who turned the 69 to the 70?
I hate that thumbnail, as I'm watching this in the middle of the night,
Pyro: Petscop 2 will come out soon


MatPat: on petscop 4
Pyro: I‚Äôll release petscop 2 soon

Mat pat: PETSCOP 5
Me: Oh, that sounds like what code bullet is doing. 
MatPat: Code bullet
Me: hairhorns
He said "A MINUTE AND A HALF" at exactly 1:30
hTeyhtRtTtvJi HUnGGgVGyVGfTggFgHbbgGvb


Translation: Make pyrocinical do petscop 2. Your our only hope....
I can‚Äôt believe I still watch this series after the first one scarred me for life
Anyway, keep up the good work guys!
I don‚Äòt know if anyone mentioned this before, but I like this editing ‚Äùstyle‚Äù more instead of the ‚Äùlive action‚Äù matpat...! Btw I love your work and videosüçì‚ù§Ô∏è
When there is no intro you know things are about to get REAL
Petscop and Fnaf: Exists
GameTheory: It‚Äôs free real estate
5:51 it's actually Fun is infinite (it's the actual translation and I think it makes it more scary)
MatPat: uploads a petscop vid before pyrocinical*
Pyrocinical:
You dare oppose me mortal
Even marvel doesn't have lore that intricate!
Me: but do you have a-
Captain America: but we have a hulk
Me: O_O
When i was watching this mah mum said we are getting take out and i was like ‚ÄúYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAA‚Äù
Then i realized i was watching this
Pyro : I wIlL rEaLeAsE pEtScOp 2

Matpat : tOo lAtE
This channel is a reincarnation of Albert Einstein and Sherlock
I can‚Äôt believe you shout out code bullet omg you should check out the arg he made
OPEN YOUR MIND

runs off building,  then hit a dumpster BAAAAAAANNNNNNGGGGGGG
i dont think petscop would end at 21, why would such simple logic be used in petscop? lul
Aight look, this series was absolutely  amazing and I loved it, thank you MatPat




I still want Pyro to upload Petscop 2 tho
so petscop, "cop" like a criminal investigator. its a program to profile criminals and how they behave...but also creates victim profiles
Matpat:Im about to ruin this games whole career!
MatPat! I made a Game Theory stage on SSBU! 
ID: M8K40J39
Stage name: Game Theory
Creator: Teaguel
I‚Äôm so happy you mentioned code bullet, thank you game Theory!
I was confused until you said Creepypasta,and then I got it XD
Matpat: we're about to get one of  our theories confirmed.


Me: happiness noises


Youtube: hah you fell into my trapcard ad break!!
Am I the only one who wants this to be a real game?
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Why can't Pyrocynical 
Upload Petscop 2
FOR GOD SAKE MAT PAT - GIVE PYRO A CHANCE
1:14, ‚Äú...Even if a solid minute and a half of those uploads is dedicated to just this...‚Äù
‚Äú...Here people say that I pad out my runtimes.‚Äù

*THE LAST 4 MINUTES OF THIS VIDEO IS ALL ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BUY HIS MERCH!!!*
Pyro: I'm not making Petscop 2!
Matpat: Fine, I'll do it myself...
I was just about to comment code bullet and then you just say he is ur favorite youtuber and I love him to almost as much as you üëç
Pyrocinical gonna use this as an excuse to not make petscop 2
13:26 Tr3-vr right behind you

Is Petscop haunted?
Short answer: No; ghosts aren‚Äôt real.






‚Ä¶Or are they?
sega what were you taking?!


I'm dead I love Matt Patt
Petscop 2. The best video we'll never see

MatPat pls help Pyro
6:54 MatPat: FIRST BIG THEORY CONFIRMATIONS IN THIS SERIES! 

Ad: So you think you can make me fall in love in a single day 

me: AUGGGHHHHHH
Thank you for introducing me to CodeBullet and the concepts involved with AI. It has fed my interest in programming and problem solving. Thank you.
Did I help do my job Matpat?

(I said that "Paul" was uploading more than usual at some point in time)
"Sega, what were you taking??"



A life probably
Me trying to do my homework:
YouTube:let‚Äôs stop that
Jokes on you, I was already subscribed to Code Bullet before you shouted him out!
You missed putting an actual picture of Dr. House on 6:26
4:38 I see that dark souls reference editing team. Clever.
Ah yes petscop for the 3ds Pyrocynical still needs to play petscop 2
It's amazing that he promotes small channels
15:13 after it blurred out the pixels/mosaics are gone and I see something...
wait...the treadmill and the flower stop at 3...coincidence? I THINK NOT
Me: Hmm... looks like I missed some petscop theory episode. 



 W H A T  !!!
The game is just like a printer it copies the storyline and make a different copy
MatPat releases a new Petscop video before Pyrocynical
Pyrocynical fans: Wait that's illegal
Can we talk about the fact that MattPatt himself didn't appear on the screen?
Oh my god when you started talking about guided algorithms and started to mention a YouTube channel my first thought was code bullet and so it was
If I get the therory lamp I would hook it up to my switch dock üëå
Hey matt i just wanted to say your my favorite youtuber and your video's help me deal with my father passing away and im just 13
Imagine if one day we supposedly find a secret website that just casually drops a playable full version of the game.
I heard codebreaker and my mind went to the new warriors book (spoiler) that talks about the past warrior code breaking cats (spoiler end) aaaaaaaa aaaaaAAAAAAAA
I don't know if it's just me but I'm just flat out scared to watch it without mattpat's voice around.
Matpat I have a deltarune theory.

Remember at the end of the game and when Kris throws there soul in the cage and you came to the conclusion the they didn't want to be controlled.
Well I believe that Kris threw away your control cuz they didn't want to be controlled by you the player, but rather be controlled by chara.
Also remember at the end of the undertake genocide run chara says that they will purge that timeline and move onto the next which I believe will be the deltarune timeline.
Matpat that just woke up: 0:04 Theory to Internet Game Hello
After the Mumbling Matpat can Now Speak
Me Being Damn right Sarcastic: Congratulations you can Speak
Petscop is officially the new FNaF.
I think this is video 5.
We have 18 more to go.
OMG I watch code bullet ALL THE TIME!
Pyro: I will release petscop 2
Matpat: HoLd mY ThEorY
Do video on the science of p-switches
Man that jacket and those shirts looks so nice... I wish I could buy em DX Being poor sucks...


Also I love this episode. I've always been so fascinated by Petscop!
Matpat: doesn‚Äôt add in normal intro or skit of him dressed up like the Petscop character

Me: Ooohhh boy. There‚Äôs a twist.
Will you ever cover something SCP related? Just a fan of the Foundation
Death social sounds cery creepy: still ranting about posts even though you are dead via a computer algorithm.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This was uploaded on my birthday, thanks matpat
Hey, nice Annoying Orange reference.Also Petscop 16 is an actual room impulse.
Me: about to get sleep
Game Theory: I'm about to end this mans whole career.
Wow some actual good merch not just a t-shirt with a small logo that‚Äôs over priced for no reason
Robot:talks about the blood of the innocent
Detroit: become human
Thank you for shouting out one of my favorite channels Code Bullet

-So?
-I slept that night.
-You got the job! Congratulations!


Edit: 1k likes! Guys thanks!
This upload literally had me watching the petscop‚Äôs videos and theories for like 2 days straight. Not disappointed.
LETS GO!!! Ma boi code bullet got recognised. Not that he needed it anyway
I need answers pls.
Why did our boi matpat bring up the topic again.
I'm not angry but actually quit delighted . Just wondering why
The background sounds at the very beginning are what amazing creepy pasta writer flip la scrip uses in most if not all of his stories. Love you Mat Pat
Petscop 2 !!!!! Finally your dad can be released from pri- 

Hol up, wrong channel
Matpat: Is this game haunted?


Adeptus Mechanicus: This is obviously heresy.
four hours later I've come back to watch the episode after you said "go watch it", so I watched it and all your theories on it, it was fun^^
WHY
NEW SPRING THEORY WEAR AFTER I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE NORMAL THEORY WEAR
Holy crap
That just blow my mind
Me: Mom can we get Petscop 2?
Mom: We already have Petscop 2 at home.
Petscop 2 at home:
CGP grey also has a great vid on how people make algorithms
Also, Paul's name so this feels personal. Better than Paul the alien, I say XD
Game theory:improved

YouTube notification: letting the person in front of me decide what I eat
This game is already creepy on its own but the editing make its 10x creepier especially as it‚Äôs getting dark out side.
Game theory: i shall analyze petscop!

Pyrocyinal: am i a joke to you?
Me: watches this at 3:46 AM

Also me: trembling
The Sonic Cd soundtedt screen translates to "Fun is Infinite with Sega Enterprises - majin" i might be wrong with the spelling of the sognature, but close enough
This is actually really interesting and I have been watching since the first video of the series you continue to amaze me Mat keep it up dude‚ù§Ô∏è
I just realized what you did with the night intro

Clever
Pyro: i will not make petscop 2




Game theory: Fine....ill do it myself
Dad needs theory, theorize with Dad help him fix YouTube DADFEELS
I've been watching code bullet for 4 months now, and he is SOO COOL
@MatPat

Wheni saw that cinnamin roll bit, i died cause i was eating those too lol
Explaining the FNAF timeline:drake pointing to it 
Explaining the petscop timeline:pointing away
Thanks for shouting out Code Bullet! I love his channel!
PETSCOP 30 IS OUT BUT WE HAD ONLY 21, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!
So this month, we have had Avengers Endgame, which is the end of Phase 3 in the MCU. Also, we have had the final episode of Petscop. Hmmmmm....
Mind my racist remark but this cracks sound low key like a serial killer

Mat is Marvin?
Nobody:
Petscop: 90 seconds of house
God, the creepy computer voice makes me tingle‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 





Was that TMI? Sorry.
Damnit mat how can you make a horror thing so enjoyable but so informative?
MatPat just assumed that the community wouldn't watch the 999th episode of Minecraft.
Even when talking about another game (Or something else) FNAF Always finds a way in.
I enjoy this style of video editing better, having matpat on screen was just weird for some reason
To answer your question, no. But that thumbnail certainly is.
DUDE CODEBULLET IS ONE IF MY FAVORITE CHANNELS TOO! I WAS SUBBED TO HIM SINCE BEFORE 150k
the sp00k has ended, you are now (hopefully) safe
I love how you gave a Shout out to code bullet. He's one of my favorite youtubers!
Im so happy he plugged code bullet
Maybe it was 5 new installations of the series, because 4 of the video the videos were 2 to 5 more minutes, with the
second to last being 18 minutes long. (Edit: 5 or more minutes.) (2nd Edit: 3 videos, not 4)
All these aired on my birthday and the 21st one geez talk about creepy
when you were talking about learning algorythms I knew you were gonna mention code bullet hahaha, that guy is the best
And with that code bullet, gained millons of subscribers
He said rest like the fnaf right.....
.




Well guess what shxt that Scott gave him
He mentioned Code Bullet.
I am happy.
Seeing you plug Code Bullet made me so happy, I love his channel. As soon as you started talking about Genetic Algorithms, I thought of CB.
Literally everytime merch drops or i notice it did i dont fckn have money.. thanks for that, every youtuber id like to buy merch of
this channel is a master at editing and intros
15:13 You might want to fix the censorship there, Matpat.
*takes a deep breath*

Matpat: The end 


Petscop creators: Scott hold my beer
Past... What? 3 vids? 
"episode __ definitely has an air of finality to it." 

And you now say this is the end?
 if you want it to end stop saying that it's going to end.
Petscop for Nintendo switch! Play online multiplayer with Nintendo switch online!
The moment evolutionary ai was mentioned I thought of Code Bullet. He is one talented youtuber with some very interesting videos
TOTALLY OFF TOPIC: I think I should go delete my search history nowüòê
question is kingdom hearts more elaberit ü§î...  yes
I would totally buy your awesome merch if:
A - I had money
B - I had money
C - I had money
And D - I wasn't so self conscious
...However...
If that theory light is still available by August, I might just have something cool on my birthday wish list for once
Love code bullet. He's awesome and puts tons of time into his work.
Thanks for putting game theory‚Äôs old format back I preferred it alot more
the imagery in this series is super creepy. thank god i watched it right before going to sleep! : ) /s
I had to go back and watch the entire series all over again to understand this episode lol, I forgot this existed for a minute XD
Next I play with my PlayStation I‚Äôm not getting this game
Captain America: Matpat... We may not have much lore........... BUT.... 

WE HAVE A HULK!
Matpat: uploads petscop video 


Pyro: Wait, that's illegal
The deadsocial thing reminds me of black mirror brb.
14:44 I saw this thru the corner of my eye and slapped my computer cus I thought it was falling. -_-
Did he fix it? He‚Äôs back to using photoshop-funny-eyes Matt?
I want petscop to be like don't hug me I'm scared or salad fingers for this generation of children üòÇüòÇ I'm 13 and I like this! I'm showing it to my friends
‚ÄúWell you heard the murdrous robot!‚Äù
      -MatPat 2019
Petscop is so scary but I can't stop watching it.
Oh, god...this is 100% gonna be the new FNaF, isn't it?
FINALLY THE MAN SPEAKS ABOUT CODE BULLET!!
I really want to buy some merch but I don't have money üò¢and I'm too young to buy üò¢üò¢
wait so if it's concluded, does that mean it's time for petscop 2?!
Best anime plot twist:


Scott Cawthon made this series
this remind me why i was scared of the old GT videos i love it
I think everyone found the secret message that says you found a secret
"Fictional playstation game" has Nintendo 2DS XL in thumbnail
EY YO DAS MA BOI RIGHT THERE 
MY BOI CODE BULLET FOR THE WIN
CaN u change how Rainer looks because he makes me extremely uncomfortable
My boy code bullet just got a shout out, damn
Instantly goes into comments looking for pyrocynical ‚Äúpetscop 2‚Äù comments
I think MatPat is obsessed with the number 5
5 nights at Freddi's
5 Bendy Chapters
And now this


Edit:OMG I never got more than 50 likes
The paul character looks like one of those pyramid heads with a mask draped over it.
Glad codebullet finally got noticed by a big channel, thanks mat!
Every series of theories Matpat comes up with are so intriguing! It's like opening a book and then getting captured by the way it's told. Every time one episode comes out I wait for the next like a new season of a netflix series. Love your work!
why the :3 in the captions?
it looks like a cat, that's why im scared
So glad to see MatPat back behind the camera! Proud of him for experimenting, but I missed the old format!
Basically
If want to make even a god danm suck game to be famous 
Is :







secrets
Do a video on doom lore. That will drive you insane.
Finally someone knows about the good 'ld cody bullety
Honestly I'm glad that the old way of matpat's editing is back, even though ronnie's no longer around.. I uh, really wasn't too fond of the livepat thing with the recent theories, and i'm glad this is back, makes me feel nostalgic. Now if we only had the 2011-2012 voicing of matpat
Pyrocinical
YOU HAD ONE JOB
ONE JOB
AND GUESS WHO DID IT FOR YOU
Not gonna lie, I'm like 99% sure Marvel has WAY more lore. I mean, we have decades of comics all branching into different directions etc
Hey Matt thanks so much on making a petscop videos
Hey! Im a big fan and I wanted to know if you could do a theory on the ending of Alice Madness Returns, I rally want to know what you think happened
the police could use a  learning algorithm to see the most likely outcomes then right?
Pyrocynical:
Game theory: petscop is still relevant god damnit
15:29 What did creepy computer generator say? He certainly did not say anyething about merch (I guess).
Who else watched the first petscop video when it had less than 100 views?
Can't wait to show off my game theory underwear at my self esteem's funeral
Why is 21 the concept here? Thats meant to be my special number!
9:26 OMG I watched a video of theirs about a week ago and it was very intresting and educational. Might watch other videos of theirs after I've gone and watched petscop.
ty for fun educational content as usual.
And the name guardian could mean protector of info or perhaps protecting something else. And he does it by preventing us from knowing the truth through amnesia without even knowing it himself
Great job I really like the intro it fits the game
Pyro fans: petscop 2?

Game theory: how bout 3?
Have you ever considered watching marI/O? It's what introduced me AI learning to play a game
If the robot knows ever thing you do, Doesn‚Äôt it know were your going to hide hate so you can never escape
*Jokes about the extending of runtime with a slowly turning house*


*1/5th of the video is a merch ad*
Matpat talk about petscop : broke

Pyrocynical talk about petscop : W O K E
Matpat: uploads a petscop video

Pyrocynical: am I a joke to you
Wait so are we going back to the old editing now? No more green screen?
Uh why a cliff hanger ugh whyyyyyyyy I love this video btw
I have 2 say your channel gives me the happiness of my hole day...when I'm down I watch these amazing videos you put on for these lucky people who watch the most amazing Youtubers in plant you should be on top..ü§¥üèºüë∏üèº.. üëë
Is it just me who thinks that the thumbnail looks like DanBull in makeup
9:27 Wait you're not gonna say-
9:29 YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSS CODE BULLET MY DUUUUUUDE I LOVE HIMMMM!!!
Fortnite season 9 started with a plot hole.
HOW THE HELL IS JONESY STILL ALIVE AFTER ALL THOSE BUNKER DAYS!?
Heck possibly YEARS
Matpat could you make a theory about Gorefield
Again my theory still stands that the game has stories within the main story!!
I love code bullet and it was so exciting when he mentioned code bullet
When mat uploads a video:

MatPat: Hello theory, welcome to internet!
This game is 10,000,000,000 Haunted, just barely beating Sonic.exe as the scariest game ever made
Whoever takes the time to add their own subtitles, please refrain from adding your own "flavor" with subs for title cards and cheeky emotes. I'd rather stick to auto-generated, thank you.
i really want to know the name of the creepy music you played when you started the video.
Well. That's it. I've officially watched every one of your videos more then 3 times. Congratulations mat pat. You keep pulling me back in lmao.
That Code Bullet shoutout was super unexpected but I love it
Good thing I‚Äôm watching this in the day time
I would‚Äôve been paranoid af omm
Code bullet taught me about algorithms and things like that so I knew what you were talking about
You sure its the final one?well...what if i tell you there was MORE?theres another channel that he made and theres MORE episodes...now...to make it harder...imma let you find it yourself...hehehe...
Reiner is the type of person to spoil Endgame
Do a game theory on when Pyro is finally gonna upload Petscop 2
EVERYONE KEEPS ON TALKING ABOUT THIS PRYO SOMETHING DUD, who is he?
Does GameTheory do episodes that aren't 2 or 3 parters anymore?
8:29 It's a nigahiga cameo! is this a collab spoiler?! THEORY CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!
Code bullet is amazing!! I‚Äôm so glad you mentioned him. Hopefully this will help grow!!
I was looking for the pyro comment I realize I was in the wrong video.
Imagine the size of the Playstation memory card they must be using?
Wait how did you access the sound test of a fictional game?
i wonder how long Matpat took to decide whether this should go on film theory or game theory.
I have a question. Did you break the green screen or something it seems to be gone from this theory
It's about time we got a new Petscop theory.


I've totally never clicked on a notification so fast
I've watched code bullet for so long!
Lol petscop uploads more than ceedayü§£
This is the only Petscop video that I haven't watched at 12 at night in the dark
My name is Ker. Pronounced like Care so its weird to hear my name
Mattpat: I'm going to make another video on petscop.
Fnaf: hold my beer
I thought you were going to stop making videos about this but okay
When's the next episode coming God darn it, I hate that I love this series uuuughh
For some reason your videos scare me. But I still love your videos
Code Bullet finally getting the recognition he deserves!!!
Oh look another Petscop video
Pyrocynical: wait that's illegal
I love Code Bullet! Glad to see him get a shoutout.
the title is um, 10/10.
When Pyro won't give us Petscop 2, you gave us this.
2:51 the marvel multiverse begs to differ but continue.
Pyro: I‚Äôm not gonna do it. I‚Äôm not. Im not gonna-

Game theory: UGH ALRIGHT FINE. I‚ÄôLL DO IT.
Hey hey! You called back to mAh boi code bullet!
Petscop: literally uploads anything 
MatPat: "I think this is the end of the series."
YES! THE OLD FORMAT IS BACK!
Game theory: Sega WHAT THE F were you putting?
Me: 0-o
Happy mother's day Stephanie!! Your first year for the rest of your life! God speed!
Says there‚Äôs too much to cover in one vid then proceeds to promote clothes for half of the vid. Wtf. Lol
no one:
absolutely no one:
video intro: Ga meth eory
The sound test sonic looks like movie sonic maby that's whare they got the disine from
oof petscop is low-quality
XD
He knows code bullet too!






I bet this will lift code bullet out of depression.
17:36
Is it just me or the audio goes low around here?
U should do a video on Stardew Valley plz play it it‚Äôs the best game ever
These videos give me nightmares but i keep watching it
Wtf he just uploaded a new petscop episode while I was watching this
No one:

Pyrocynical: "Thief."
Yub needs to play this game, I love your videos always making me think about each game you talk about so deep theory s oh wait  it is not a theory a game theory and also my grammer is bad, what I'm saying Is I love yo videos.
Mat remember doki doki and the other game all theorist find out the game name!!!
Wait seasick but XD
matpat: 'references a youtuber I watch'
me: "hey I know that guy!"
I am upset you didn‚Äôt use his AI walking video.
When Pyrocynical still hasn't uploaded Petscop 2
Me: Well, i guess this'll have to do
Why Mememan's voice was at the intro?
Petscop theory videos from Matpat are my late night drug.
An AI giving secrets was an episode of black mirror
Wait, Code Bullet?
I like that guy
Pyro never wanted to make Petscop 2, so MatPat did it...

THE HERO WE NEVER KNEW WE NEEDED
Great now I‚Äôm seeing the face in the thumbnail in my room at night.
did ever hear him says long after your a live
He brings up the cube taking up a minute and a half on exactly 1:30
Finally your old video format is back
The only thing haunted is Pyrocynical not making Petscop 2
‚ÄúIs it haunted?‚Äù
video is tagged #haunted
Rainer‚Äôs eyes will forever be burned into my mind
:O did know ur a fan of Code Bullet  cuz i also likes it :3
Your into is perfect for r/ihadastroke
I appreciate the voice overs better and the use of images and animation better, when you‚Äôre speaking in person in the video for some reason it distracts from the point and when you explain things I can‚Äôt envision them in my mind as I would with just the voice over. 

(Thanks for the likes, I love MatPat and his channels and content!! Zero hate üíïü§ìüíï)
My birthday was at 21st of April....
We‚Äôre back to this again? I‚Äôm EXITED
lol at the start my video was buffering, but I thought it was the video so I just sat there for like 5 minutes then realized it was youtube not the video HAHAHA
Sounds like Surreal Entertainment up in this intro bit**. And in the outro promotion.
Matpat: You heared the murderous computer buy some theory wear!!!
Me: submitting to the scary robot overload
Oh boy
Easter was a really good day
Even GT did Petscop 2 before Pyro
Idk if it‚Äôs just me but that sonic song could be a kinda good beat for a song or something or maybe I‚Äôm a psychopath when it comes to music
Game theory‚Äôs Petscop 2 üòÇ
(Pyrocinical reference)
Matpat: uploads a petscop video

the Pyrocynical fanbase would like to know your location
Is it weird that I watched your first Petscop video that was like 20 minutes while I was in the hospital in 2017
MAT.PAT.FREAKIN SUPER MARIO MAKER 2.MAKE A THEORY PLZ!!! FOR EVERYONE WHO DONT KNOW GO SEARCH SUPER MARIO MAKER 2 IN YT!!!!!! MATPAT  PLZZZZ
lol I like how you ignore the fact that the generations also show differences in level design and that they don't really support your rotation theory. Sure, the generations have different versions of the game, one where the door was open and the other wasn't or even the Garalina sign being different. However, the thought process getting there was kind of a stretch. 


Also, way to disprove yourself that Marvin in that instance was an AI by explaining that AI get test data. 
There's no way that an AI pretending to be Marvin would be able to find the grave. Why? Because Rainer doesn't know where the grave is. The AI has to go through trials and measure itself against the test data to know what to reproduce. If Rainer doesn't know where the grave is then there is no point in making an AI to find it. It'd be like putting a baby out in the wilderness and telling it to find it's way home.
Perfect setting im in the restroom by myself and its pretty late
Yes finally the old format, this is amazing. Thank you
6:24 house is my favorite house. House is existance. House is time. House is an object. :)
I'm so proud of you Code Bullet! you did it!
when game theory makes petscop 2 before pyro
Sega,
what where you taking?
Me: decides to start finals
Matpat: releases a new video
Final's study guide: Am I a joke to you?
Why do you draw Rainer in such a menacing manner
So Petscop is just Freddy‚Äôs now, huh?

Cool.
MatPat Im sorry but GUYS be carefull watching this... It can turn you insane!
No one while probably see this but can you do a theory on mystic messenger . There's so much lore.
Im tryna decide wether to watch the video or wait for Pyrocynical to do Petscop 2
"Even Marvel doesn't have a story this elaborate."
Stan Lee - But we have a Hulk.
Ah hell yeah! nothing makes me want to buy YouTube merch like a murderous robot telling me to do so!
Remember it's just a theory.   A GAME THEORY. Thanks for watching . I subcribed ,hit the like button and smash the notification button
neat how mat pat knows about one of the smaller youtubers. but yeah, code bullet is awesome
Petscop is like bendy and the ink mahine...why?
bruh a 5 minute plug on merch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
Nobody:
Pat with the finishing theory:(BUSTS DOWN FRICKING DOOR) HERE IS THE STUFF
Sigh. I wish I wasn't broke. All that amazing merch was calling my name.
The fact I just got a PS1 and then I watch this.
Nightmind: There's just not enough to make a cohesive theory about this
Gametheory: Hold my diet coke.





Now the real theory: Did I really put pepsi, and mean coke? Or is this a just an elaborate ruse by the comment section, inspired by this comment?
no pants? would have been awesome to be able to also buy those
Someone please get this man a copy of World End Syndrome, please. It has sooooo much theory fodder!
now I just need some Game Theorist kneesock
I love creepy game and film theories pleasssseee do more
Loving the plug for Code Bullet üòÇü§ô

REEE
Petscop: PS1
Thumbnail Artist: 3DS
Wait a minute something's wrong with pyro's new video...
I LOVE YOU THANK U FOR MAKING ANOTHER PETSCOP VID
I must have missed something how did the AI get to become so close the the bad guy if it only evolved to leave a room?
Matpat: even marvel doesn't have lore that complicated

Captian America: but we have a hulk

Rip I'm dead üòÇ XD
Hey, does anyone know where I can find the voice generator being used in this episode?
Lmao the newest 5 episodes were uploaded on my birthday
The binary on the shirt says "hello internet" in case anyone was wondering
Petscop is played on a ps4 and he put it on a ds nani?!
Personally I actually haven‚Äôt watched any of the episodes, but do want to. I still have seen all the Game Theories on Petscop though and it feels like I‚Äôve watched everything just from how good these theories are. Really good job to all of you guys and girls on the Theorist Team and keep up the good work!
Me: can we have Petscop 2?

Pyro: No we already have Petscop 2 at home.
Petscop 2 At Home:
Remember that time everyone thought we would fall off the world if we sailed too far oh wait we still think that bad example but anyway I don't think we have anything to worry about in terms of A.I most likely over reacting.
Where is Pyro when you need him?
I think that Matpat should become a detective!
Computer Voice:
The beautiful flowers
The spring breeze that I will never feel
The blood of the innocents I shall one day consume
Matpat: Well you heard the murderous robot! Go and check out some of the new theory wear in the link down bellow! :D
OMG ITS BACK 





But its also over yah or no yah
I got happy when he shouted out code bullet ngl
HE CUSSED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON GAME THEROY!!!! screams
Bruh this is creepy my birthday is also on november 12
I just love this channel on they amount on detail....even though my brain sometimes have a difficulty putting together the lore
People: So what design u want for paul?


petscot: yes
Random Hidden temple reference is random.




Theory Matpat created Petscop just for the theory fuel.
This is why pyro stays away from this game
Came here for petscop 2.  Goddammit pyro
Mat: makes petscop videos

Pyro: I'm i a joke to you?
I like matpat but the other guy is creepy...
Alright its official. Scott cawthon is marvin
Hey matpat, so you know how you said in your fnaf ultimate custom night video that we play as William Afton going through an endless cycle of torment? Well then why is there an animatronic called Afton that You're able to put in your night?
I need a theory..... A DIGIMON theory.
Matpat: i won't cover everything in one episode

Also Matpat: starts the episode at 4:16 and ends it at 15:30

Viewers: Are we a joke to you?
Theory idea: who exactly did the "A Hat in Time" Badge Man used to be?
Yes! Pixel Pat is back!!
wait why is it back to the old format?
Plz do a theory over "What Remains  of Edith Finch". Thanks!
PETSCOP 2!

Oops wrong channel...
Love you man but JEEZ that‚Äôs like 4 minutes of advertising lmao.
The petscop 2 pyro could never make
Its an episode of black mirror.
Me: Mom I want pyrocynical's petscop 2
Mom: But we already have petscop at home


Petscop at home:
MatPat: Mentions Code Bullet
Me: I watch that guy! Awesome.
Fnaf: i'm the scariest game 

Petscop: oh yeah? Guess what? My lore is real
This actually smells like Black Mirror
You have selected Microsoft Sam as you computer's default voice.
The intro was brilliant!! Game theory has got to be one of the very best channels as far as design and style goes.
FNAF: i am the scariest game

Petscop: Hold my Beer
This is the kind of theory I subscribed for ages ago.
Short answer: 
No



Long answer: 
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mama miya pizariya






Only deeps understand
I'm living for the merch ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

No
9:29 oh yeah. Code bullet. Sweet sweet code bullet. Who have an anuriysm 3 times in a row to make video
You play the "Bye-bye" sound 366 times? ... Year-and-a-day?
"Its an ai thats learning it's movements" Its a Rumba
I read this as "Is This Video HAUNTED?!?!?!"
I also watch Code Bullet!!!
Man he's real good.
HELL YES YOU ALSO LIKE CODE BULLET IM NOT ALONE!!!!!!!!!
7:59 People whomst watch Code Bullet:
Setting glasses just so they seem white because of a reflection



 Lul you actually know Code Bullet?
Yo mat pat you reddy for a nother freddy(cek afton robotics)
Matpat: We can finally put this series to rest
Game makers: Petscop the Dark Revival in HE coming soon
pls make film theory on Damien, I bet you're alreade working on it but pls
Oh congrats on trending mat pat :3
Sees this video







Im not gane even trust anyone in the internet
I am curious if you can do a theory of Mr torgues explosive guns from borderlands 2
Mat pat does petscop video petscop ends 





Pyrocynical: STOP TELLING ME TO UPLOAD PETSCOP 2
Mom, can I sleep with you tonight?
I saw the thumbnail and im like "ahahah no not watchin this i want to sleep"
12 am: watches video

(Half way throuhh my ear buds started to make a glitchy sounds but they are new.....)
Ur merchant is so good it makes me shake
Is petscop a game, or is it animated?
Petscop? : Scary
Game? : Theory
Hotel? : Trivago
Hey matpat what happed to doki doki. Monika said something about 2018 and nothing has happed. What about the cult in Yuri‚Äôs book and project Lebatina. It‚Äôs strange that we haven‚Äôt here‚Äôd anything about it and it got me thinking. Maby an update got uploaded on the reddit
I'd still infinitely prefer if pyro made the petscop 2 video
Mat: "Is this game haunted?"


Me: This game is woke Skynet on crack 'n dope. Don't ask why, I'm not high. If A. I. learned to lie, we all die.
Personally I think Reiner's probably planning on making the A.I to torture it, assuming your theory's true. Someone who devotes their life to undoing a single person isn't likely to be content with doing it once.
9:27 hell yeah!
He deserves some credit for all of his efforts to make coding educational and fun to watch
FLIP, FLIP, FLIP!
That thumbnail will haunt my dreams...
in accounting plus vr in the tree level grow the seed come back to the stage later and put the apple on your face this will cause you to find the second secret level then take the head set from that level and you end up in the third secret level
CODE BULLET!!! 9:00
Petscop: 21 episodes
Marvel MCU: 21 movies

We are in the endgame now
You: you think the new design is creepy, see this! shows Japanese secret
Me: the new design fills my nightmares with far more ease
15 minutes into a 20 minute video and it ends
So Your other Petscop theorys of it being haunted were false!
My man code bullet!!!! üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
you made petscop 2 before pyro im disappointed
Is anyone else trying to decode the merch already cause I can't decode the alien part of one of the shirts

PYROCYNICAL WHERE IS PETSCOP 2.
Wait a minute... This isn't petscop two
MatPat at 15:08: "Gotta censor that one"

*pauses at 15:13*
yea, well done on censoring that
Love CodeBullet. Glad to see him getting exposure.
How did Paul find out you had to click it 366 times and then press Uh Oh
New Petscop Theory? Instant like, multiple views in a row, and so much hell yes
You posted this on my birthday...
The internet can be scary sometimes.

Depends what your doing on the internet.
Who thinks Game Theory should do an episode on one of Tf2's healing items like Heavy's Sandvich or the Medigun
The quitter episode gave me claustrophobia
That intro made me dyslexic
cant wait for the next theory, i hope you cover all the censored objects and more about paul there
The second you mentioned a YouTube channel that does AI algorithms, my minded immediately went "He's gonna say Code Bullet isn't he?"
Who noticed the eyes on the left at 11:23
dang it were running out of dead kids
as soon as you gave the shoutout, i instantly yelled 
Ayyyyyy
and everyone around me just looked at me like im on something
if the ancient one had the infinity gauntlet


heres snap snap the mother clucking *snap snap tea
Oh shoot matpat uploaded a video do NOT CLICK YOU WILL GET NIGHTMARES IT'S NOT WORTH-





Well... I did that. Regrets regrets...
excuse me matpat but can you do another tf2 vs overwatch vid but where you actioully study and not involve racism.
along with the guy you had represent tf2 probably never played the game.
i just recently seen it and really im dissapointed by the lazyness in the video.
i will do what the so called theorist won't.
and matpat why don't you play spy in pyroland.
More Petscop! Thank god. I gotta know.
Technically, the YT-Algorithm isn't a evolutionary algorithm but a supervised learning AI, but YT trains several AIs at once and selects every few months a new AI that delivers the best results, so this analogy wasn't as good as it seems. Also the analogy to CBs "Worlds hardest game"-AI wasn't so good, a better one would be his Hill Climb Racing AI because it is the same type as the AI in Petscop.
"Wait a minute, Rainer, ah... are you telling me, you built a crime-solving A.I.... out of a PlayStation game?"
Rainer: ""The way I see it, if you're gonna build a crime-solving A.I., why not do it with some style?"
Person: what's your favorite clothing company? I really like Gucci!
Me: Oh, I love film, and game theory!
Person: What? What the hell is that?
Me: My favorite clothes designer company, duh.
rainer is super scary can you please stop :(
Who else came here from a code bullet video
Mass effect indoctrination theory part two still has not been released yet

Lmao, that thing has tourettes
To many things with the number 5...wait
Five Nights at Freddy's
5 Bendy and the ink machine chapters, and now this? More horror games, keep up the great work Mat
This probably also has to do with poppy just think about it only isn't really her self they could of brain washed her into knowing nothing into thinking what poppy thinking 
It's just a thought...
I wish this could become a new horror game
ive been subbed to code bullet for 7 months
omg I didn't realize it had continued !!!!! super cool
Me: not one, not two, but three
GameTherory: not one, not two but five
Me: questions life
4:01 that sounds an awful lot like homestuck ü§£
I played that Sonic but I didn't want to know that, nightmare fuel increases
Doesn‚Äôt pan his video adds a 4 minutes of merch plug
This has always bugged me. Why tf does "Reiner" look like JacksFilms? (Also, "Reiner"'s name sounds like Reigner (The one who governs))
The last time I was this Early Alexander Hamilton was still alive

(I'm sorry)
Next video: Elmo has a dark secret
Will like because of Code Bullet, that dude is a legend xD
Hold up
the socks come in packs of three and all are in different colours

Sksksksks I can‚Äôt pay 60 for that jacket ;(
Can we get a Game Theory skirt? 




That would be wild
Omg pyro finally made petscope 2 this is so epic
Ha well I know how to read binary so ha. I have no friends so I learn many codes as much as I can.
Imagine the programming that went into that game.
how is that creepy secret sonic still a better design than the live action one. smh
The comments be like:
50% Petscop good
50% C O D E B U L L E T    G O O D
Adore the pescop x game theory logo at the beginning
I think this is the first time I've heard of an Investigative AI Programmer.
yes code bullet gettin some love
maybe that explains the random sprite that walks in and out of the recording in petscop 4 @ the 1:57 mark
it was another random AI mapping movements #deepmind xD
The last three times you said it was the finale it wasn't
dude, why don't you do a theory on silent hill. Its a classic, and is very vague. you can make some pretty good material out of it.
"Fine, I'll do it myself."
That was a spot-on into! And I love the new merch, excited to buy some.
I I bought $100 of merch, can I get another Undertale theory now? :p
Short Answer: Yesn‚Äôt

Long Answer: Well yes, but actually no.
In pokemon lets go your partners check summary says "Came to the kanto reigon through a mysterious force." plzz do a theory on this plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Nobody:
Matpat: says finale for the 4th episode in a row
is this a reupload? coulda swore i watched this before
Hey Matt patt a while ago you did a theory on a Ubisoft game called ‚Äúfor honor‚Äù and it was one of my favorites, and I was hoping you could do another one? You could possibly do the validity of some of the executions because I feel like there is a lot of material there! Just an idea.... a theory
This is my favourite series üòÇ
you should know  that anomiles are not real
7:45 the guardian's face turns into paul's
ive noticed that you havent really made a DOOM theary he it seems kinda odd for me  if theres a reasin you could do a DOOM theary then you should for the ske of the new game DOOM Eternal and remember RIP AND TEAR
Well this is gonna have to do while we wait for pyrocinical to release petscop 2
13:27  I COULDNT BE MORE SIMILAR IN POSTS
It's night and I'm watching this...üò•
I know this is probably a dumb question what PS are they using could be the PS1 or maybe even the four I say it might depend on what the PS is I know this is probably dumb but I think it's something valid to look into

Yeah, watch code bullet. I've been following his content for w long while and it is very entertaining.
Oh great! A series I've watched a loooooooong time ago gest a new episode! 


Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's another series that will never get a finale, hmm?
I binged watched the entire Petscop series today, and now finihing it up with MatPats theories. Going to bed tonight is gonna be... fuuuuuuun :/
Food for thought, if Rainer was making an AI to get information about Marvin, he wouldn't need to "code in text boxes to speak to the character", he would more than likely just have output files to find what he was looking for. If that is the case, why have added in the text boxes?
I am still of the belief that Petscop is an SCP.
+1 for including code bullet
this voice sounds like theodds1sout in the begining
Game theory: *Creates a good and well thought out petscop theory"

i love code bullet!
great video!

#TheGameTheorists
i know matpat what you can do for series do garfield gameboy its very scary and i have some theories about this game but first played for yourself or watch youtube
OMG I ACTUALLY LOVE CODE BULLET AND WHEN U WERE ABOUT TO INTRODUCE HIM I WAS LIKE "HE'S GONNA SAY IT" AND THEN U DID!!!!!!!!!
He changed the intro üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
This is a really interesting theory, but I very disappointed in the gendering of your merch. Me and my sister love you to death but I thought we were getting somewhere after the nonbinary inclusion in the smash episode. C'mon, Matt.
Is anyone getting dangermen at work vibes from the opening üòÇ
Mat you're an absolutely amazing youtuber! I'm so glad to have found you. I've been watching you since i was really young and your content just gets better and better. And you care so much for your fans seeing how you go the extra mile when it comes to your merch! Thankyou so much!
The video style switched back ?
Nuuuu why u make more of theez vids whhhhhhhhy
Your merch ads are super cringy and misleading
I WACH CODE BULLET ALL THE TIME!!!
Petscop
Pets - cop
A cop who catches pets
Cops catch bad guys
Are pets bad guys
Maybe Marvin is good
Hold your horses, Matpat, we're still waiting on Pyro for petscop 2.
Edit: WhY Is tHe lIkE BuTtOn bLuE?
I didn't know u watched code bullet
He is indeed fun 
Have a nice day
So a murderistic genious commits a murder but wants people to partake in a game to piece together everything he knows of his own murder case. But once we figure it out, it will be history. The murderer is probably dead. But the "guardian" is perhaps the killer in amnesia, and not someone who is trying to figure out the case. So would there be any point of solving this as for history or another reason???
Code Bullet is a legend tbh
Anyone else just get really depressed when new theory-wear is released because you want it but you can't get it...?
5:53.
You missed the signature of "majin" in the corner, meaning demon.
Knowing the Japanese, its probably a specific type of demon as well.
If you pause at 15:13 you can read the words
Ooh, MatPat toned up the language.
Did you finish dragon age origins yet, matpat?
Can I just say , I can really imagine matpat just sitting there counting how many times Paul must have pressed the sound ‚Äòcare saying bye-bye‚Äô 
And then getting frustrated because he lost count üòÇ
still faster than Petscop 2..... been waiting like year
Our boi cb made it, wooooooo!
Can yoy make video about some svience in stalker franchise ? Love your work and your channel
Bedsheets save me from the petscop demons

MATT NOOOOOOO WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS  I WAS SO READDY FOR THE FINALLY

Ya know, Mat Pat, you help me with my math class. (Im actual TRASH at math
Yeah the sonic pic was also signed buy Japanese satan
Fnaf: *All secrets currently solved*
Petscop & Bendy:
I have never been able to afford theorist merch... I cry everytime y'all talk about new merch.... I feel like less of a fan because of this...
Is this petscop 2?
wait so could u use a generation to win a video game for you, like fortnite or something?
Mat could sell me anything tbh~ but honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen this much detail in merch and oh my lord I love all of it!
Remember this first one where they kill a kid by wrapping them in a carpet and suffocate them!? That was the original theory right!?ü§¢
This series is probably one of my favorites to watch because it scares me, I know I could never watch the actual series because one I cannot sit through that without pissing my pants.

The way you guys reveal the hidden story is absolutely amazing  and I love it so much
We wanted Petscop 2 from Pyro, not Petscop 69 from MatPat.
Hello Human theorist,
I am giving a request to tell me weather or not this doctor is an alien or not
the series is called invader zim
Basically all these comments:
Pyrocynical Petscop 2
PETSCOP 2!!!! wait this isint Pyrocynical...
2 seconds into the video and the only thing I can think

Still

I liked the jackets but I really don't want a 4min ad.
I noticed Petscop uploading, and the only thought was 'Oh boy, MattyPatty, you're in for a treat.'
Is there any spook jumps it's midnight
I used to love watching code bullet
Not related to this video but. I just think it would be reeeeally cool and awesome if you did a game theory on Dead By Daylight!!. I love your channel and videos btw. Always fun to watch
Lmao GT underwear? What‚Äôs next? Pants?
the reiner (spelling?) pic makes me GENUINLY uncomfortable holy
I wish the girls merch had clues on it too!
Matpat u always make my day better
When I saw 5:54 My mind: No anything but that. (Soundtest starts) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That thumbnail will now haunt me
Game theory: uploads

Me : time to get my popcorn
Who thinks mat is keeping this channel alive( Petscop)
Pyro's more scared of petscop 2
april 21 is my birthday
New my boy would get mentioned on you code
it'd be amazing if the creator released petscop as a game we could play. 


that'd be a golden GTlive.
*Quarter of a million subscribers*
Wow I thought you forgot about petscop!
Okay, before I watch this, I bet it‚Äôs gonna be a 2 parter... just a hunch...

Yay!! I love all the thought and information you put into these videos, and two parters mean more complete theories!! And thank you for putting so much thought into merch:)

Also, I‚Äôm gonna have mix up the way I type to make it harder for the AI...
Sick? Yes
Petscop? Creepy
FNAF? Never ending
Hotel?Trivago
MatPat? Best
As someone who love algorithm and love Code Bullet, I love your simplistic explanation yet also let ppl have the enough information to learn about thanks‚ù§Ô∏è
THE LAST THREE MINUTES IS A SELLOUT!!!!
You should do a theory on MK, whether it is on the deadliest fatality, most powerful character, or even maybe figuring out if there is a fatality you could survive would all be interesting
Matpat should just make a video describing his merch lol
Can't for Pyro to be like in the comment section
Thief.
Pyro: h- 
Mattpat : I‚Äôm gonna end this mans whole career
Me scared, duolingoes and this, sees petscop in room, ‚ÄúAHHH,‚Äù 5:38 ‚Äúespanol?‚Äù Me says, ‚Äú great job!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm duolingo bird!‚Äù Petscop says, also scary sonic = sonic.exe confirmed!

Roses are red

Yay i got a like
But why is it blue ?
Looks like matpat founda new fnaf to milk
The dance video syncs up 100% perfectly with ace of bass's "I saw the sign", complete with movements syncing up to different parts of the song,  which is great considering the episode title is "the sign", and they're the exact same length.

I think you could try an talking angela theory
Ur channel is dying
Procedural Evidence Testing Simulation Cop
nobody:

petscop: yknow what the people need



its a dance party
Paul look like they were made with the stage builder from smash bros.
So, a bit of curiosity: petscop is a PS1 game. PS1 used memory cards. How are there already saves on the card?
I love petscop videos and game/film theory
This is great, Pyro.
You finally made petscop 2, ama-
oh wait nvm
I have to say that the Petscop series is one of the best creepypastas I know and the way it is presented is so creative it blows my mind!
I loved this series, despite the creepy vibes I got from the games
I'm just wondering if this was done with Net Yaroze.
Can you pls do a video on left 4 dead?? üòÖüòÖ
Game Theory: Releases petscop 200
Pyrocynical: Am i a joke to you?
Finally, petscop 2.....


oh
Lol ya I love code bullet to
Matpat: Mentions code bullet

Me: Haha I already watch that
Has anyone else ever wondered how many calories Big Smoke‚Äôs order was?
Glad you did a shout out for Code Bullet, it a very informative and interesting channel... kinda like yours!
How can Peach and Pauline be around the same age if the marios are actually father and son? You explain in a previous video that the Pauline Mario games and the Peach Mario games are diffeent Marios.  Please explain this about Suoer Mario Odessy.  How can Pauline and Peach be around the same age if they're from diffrent timelines in the Mario "Canon"?
I had an idea for a theory... do who does corrin belong to... hoshido... or norh
I know this isnt on subject but I was drawing some fnaf characters and I realized that circus baby has no ears is she suppose to ?
Y'all should make Theory tanks (sleeveless shirts) for those theorists who like to get *PUMPED*.
OMG YOU SHOUTED OUT CODE BULLET, I LOVE HIS CHANNEL!
Spolier alert: no

Say no to clickbait.
CODE BULLET HELL YA!!
Hey Matpat, Markiplier posted a video called DAMIEN and I was wondering if your smart theory mind could help us Markiplites decode it?
I just watched a pyronical video and this came out
Pyrocinical: Petscop
Game Theory: Also Petscop
Internet: This is fine.
Wow i also watch code bullet.
Why is it that everytime there's trouble, it's always you two? Michael Hannond and Michael Afton
Who is watching at 2-4 AM for the chill  is it just me
The creepist thing is Reners charater
Where's petscop PYRO!






...........oops wrong channel and video
Hey Matpat, could you theory/recap on Markiplier's story that he is making. He recently posted a new part to his ongoing story called 'Damian' (and also Wilford 'Mother-loving' Warfstash a while ago) which continues on from 'who murdered Markiplier?'. I think it would be really cool to see some theories on it and some more light shed on what he's doing, that would be pretty cool.
Code bullet makes some great content
I'm so sorry MatPat,I wish I had the money to buy the merchandise,maybe next timeüíô
The only thing this game haunts is my dreams...
LoL I'm a fan of Code Bullet :))
Matpat has good tastes ;]
Subscribed to Code Bullet before watching this video
Over 3 minutes to get to whether or not the game is haunted....
Hey Matpat: Petscop = Pet Simulated Cop
Matpat, you totally gave me the youtube burnout
Matpat Those names of the save files are generated names we use when using Genetic Algorithms to train Neural networks. The names are used to track Family trees. So the save files could trace you back via its name to the path that was successful.
I hope this helps code bullet
Love how Paul is Purple Guy now
12:50 That company is Straight outta Black Mirror.
Thank u for not using that classroom like editing formatüò≠üíú
I remember seeing the sonic infinte fun when i was like 8 a lnd has nightmares for that month.
As of watching this, episode 26 came out 5days who
The cheat note on 4:36 has my exact birthdate ü§® what mattpatt has taught me throughout the years is that NOTHING is a coincidence .
So it‚Äôs like that one black mirror episode
Tbh I'm 18 and I'm still scare AF of that Rainer model that MatPat uses
Maybe to times he uploaded a video has something to do with the calender
Please, amazing watcher! 
Watch petscop, and other ARGs you‚Äôre following! Make an effort to support the creators of petscop and other things! Like what Night mind says, these analyses don‚Äôt fully blow over the whole series. It‚Äôs important to know what‚Äôs happening!
I've been subscribed to code bullet for a long time now. Can't believe you mentioned him.
SPOILERS for Black Mirror







feels kind of like White Christmas
I love how even though MatPat has power on the YouTube scene, he uses it for good,
Promoting small channels
Fundraising 
Entertaining and inspiring millions even just by nerding out
Doesn't do anything shady(I hope)
What's there not to love about MattyPatty01?
‚ÄúThis seems like the logical conclusion of Petscop,‚Äù said MatPat twice before, and again just now, as if not learning his lesson during his first four Petscop videos.

Methinks MatPat needs some time in the Quitter‚Äôs Room.
Scott make your games bigger
Has pyro made a joke about this yet
I feel so smart. I also noticed the AI genetic algorithm
We finally got what Pyrocynical never gave us...





Petscop 2 WHERE IS IT PYROOOOO
When gametheory's hoodies are better designed than Cloak's
At this rate, Pyrocynical doesn't NEED to release Petscop 2. 




Pyro? You here? That's right, I'm challenging you. Release Petscop 2 and I won't unleash Scott The Woz on your subreddit.
Hey game theory, you know how when Steve opens doors in Minecraft, he instantly opens them with only swinging his hand at the door once? It would be an interesting idea if you would see what will happen if Steve opens a door with the same speed in Minecraft, and with his swinging motion on it in the real world's physics :)
that dude at 1431 I stg
MatPat: * plugs Code Bullet *
Me: "Oh. My. God! YAS!"
Anyone else want an Austin yelling counter?  Or an Austin yelling compilation?
Does the merch still come with a pin?
I wish I could get your merch but I can‚Äôt ;-;
Do a dragon ball video
90 whole seconds of House!üòÇüòÇ Anyone else thinking about the show?
Your picture of Rainer looks very similar to Jim Pickens. Are you sure he isn‚Äôt the kidnapper
Your picture of Rainer looks very similar to Jim Pickens. Are you sure he isn‚Äôt the kidnapper
Oh my god, you watch Code Bullet too! I love him and his videos!
Is this a real game to train AI
Puts PlayStation game in 3ds for thumbnail


Me: wow that's racist
Please robo I'm going to figure out magic before you take over and you will have a bad time by me
It's an ARG, not a creepypasta, subtle difference, my friend.
Yayyy old editing is back I really love the way your videos are edited even though I enjoyed the green screen I enjoy this way more maybe because I don‚Äôt like change but I really love this style thanks so much for bringing it back even if it‚Äôs only for this episode

Game: has an accidentally different coloured pixel

DO YOU REMEMBER

üëçüëàüëâüëáeüòê
I was a bit scared until I heard Mat Pat.
Thumbnail killed my sleep after seeing the notification at 3am.
can you do a theory about a hat in time
this pyrocynical video seems kinda weird
Hey can you please do a video about scp containment breach
Mat I know something about fnaf that you never found it
At least MatPat did this...
Smh, Pyrocynical, smh..
This was uploaded on my bday :0
ok pyro, this isnt epic
Kinda sounds like Stephen Hawking RIP
It just like you me hell or heaven
MatPat:"murderous robot"
Me:"METTATTON!!!"
This is... confusing
Petscop
Cop step
LET'S MAKE PYROCYNICAL MAD!!!
Yay!! The editing style is back!!!!
Matpat has uploaded 3 petscop episodes before pyrocynical even finished petscop 2!
This video was up a couple of days ago on a channel called experiment
the  only youtube merch that actually looks good enough to wear! great job!
I can't get da cool wear sadly welp imma go in mah hole and binge watch fnaf theory again bye
Code bullet is my favorite too. When you said your favorite channel, I guess code bullet and I was right.
Wait a minute this isn‚Äôt petscop 2
Already watch code bullet ;)
did the crying child tears cause the spring locks to fail
Matt patt i have a theory
Finally, pyrocinical made a petscop two-  oh wait...
[Insert comment about Pyro here]
Finally another petscop video. i have been waiting for ages to upload again!!
Lore? You think any of the things you mentioned have a lot of lore? Try homestuck. You'll be asking for more lore.
I was born on the 21 of April
"How do you explain the narrative of a time-jumping, multi-character murder mystery that covers everything--"
HOMESTUCK FANS LAUGH IN THE DISTANCE
i was cleaning my shoes and accidentally rubbed my eye with it so now I think I‚Äôm going blind y‚Äôall
So far my favorite series on this channel
I translated the binary in 17.00 and its... hero gg MattPatt..... gg. Ps has any one else translated the other two?
pyrocynical has left the chat
Hey here's an idea!
In Yandere simulator, Who is fun Girl?

....sorry that was a bit random.. loved the theory!
But is it petscop 2?
At 15:11 it‚Äôs uncensored for a second
Is this internet file haunted?!??! 






Nope
When you want theory wear but don't have money.
Hey matpat I have always loved your videos and thankyou for entertaining me
Wait so is it an actual game?
Ma boye code was included
Yes old matpat I love when he dose his videoslile this
Ya I know code bullet
9:30 I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS CHANNEL BEFORE HAHAHAH
That‚Äôs how I know about learning algorithms!!!!
But isn‚Äôt the player a different person? ü§® How can he be Marvin and someone else at the same time? 

This just seems like a bit of a mini theory too me. You kinda contradict your other theories...even the some things you say in this very same video.
Bye-Bye played fast is die-die  and then its uh oh......
Don‚Äôt get your hopes up about a part two. I‚Äôm still waiting on him to finish the indoctrination theory for mass effect. When did part one for that come out? Like two years ago? üòÇüòÇ
Meanwhile, under Pyrocynical's rock...
Watch out matpat pyrocinical is coming for you... 






üëª BOO
No that would be ridiculous
you sir just got a like for shouting out code bullet
YESTERDAYU UPLoAD FRICK

wow gt and the official channel have this many petscop videos.

First there's "TIARA", then, "F**K-F**K-F**K GENETICS!"
Hey!! Cool shoutout to Code Bullet! I love that guy.
Pyrocynical for petscop 2
Hello matpat. I love ur videos. These videos are the reason why I watch youtube! Clearly, you have put a lot of effort in ur videos.I know a game you could theorize called dragon quest builders.
Bro, pyro only has 1 petscop video and game theory has 3.  
plot twist matpat is pyro, therefore he's creating his own content
Yes! The CB has been aknowlaged!!!!
Do a video on how to perfect five finger fillet and the knife game
Honestly thought it was a surreal entertainment video at first
Pyrocynical:
Mat Pat: ..... I'm going to end this mans career with Petscop.
You were right you were always right
Pyro would be proud.
Jason looking swell
I decoded the alien writing it means   game theory rules
YES. You mentioned Code Bullet! Love the guy, really interesting stuff. I was just waiting to hear it.
Eyyy! Code Bullet!
pyro has left the chat
I love code bullet! lmao
Hey Mat Pat u should do Generation Zero
I am shooketh rn omg I have been following  ur theories on petscop since "quitter" it's so weird that it's almost overüëåüëåüëå
Did anyone else see GaMETHeory on the title after the intro?
Damn, editing has really hit its peak on this video
I remember when game theory did scientific videogames questioning certain video game physics, but now they do conspiracy theories i guess...
Petscop
Reverse
Pocstep
I was wondering where I learned about algorithms until you showed Code Bullet
I saw a litttttttlllle something at 2.36
the blood of the innocent that i will someday consume
Finally petscop 2 pyro oh wait
Yeah! Code Bullet!
"The end of the series" huh? So it's the ENDGAME
Wow that's cool both the video and the fact you gave code bullet a shout-out I love that guys videos
Can you do ‚Äú why does sonic frown when he goes super sonic ‚Äú
Why does rainer look so much like Jacksfilms?
I didnt except code bullet to be mentioned in this vid ... i love that channel
So guys, we did it:
Petscop 2 confirmed 
Epic game moment
Hey Matpat, is there still a chance for those theory coins in the new spring merch? I dont think all were found and I've been wondering
Anyone got a feeling of Deja Vu while watching this?
do a Fran Bow theory
Aw I love code bullet
‚ÄúWhen your avatar is a seasick butt!‚Äù -MatPat 2019 everyone üòÇ
This games file is WAAAY to big to fit on a ps1 disc
is that dave in the thumbnail?
Just got the shirt and jacket, glad to support you and look cool doing so!
so in your last bald  about that  end ing and can you make a trory about the new  ending plz
Casually waiting for murder robot voice to say: CHEEZ PIZZA
Since the last episode released on Easter, wouldn't that hint at some kind of rebirth or Resurrection?
EYYY ITS BARRY ... matpat... what did you do to barry... why is his voice gone weird? AHH!
Pyro please...
rip pyro
Intro: starts playing
Me: Yoda?
I have crap my pants at the sonic part
Did you just say you pat out your run times? I see what you did there.
I wonder whats going on
Alright guys im going to full screen
That's cool!I know what you're talking about because of codebullet

Edit:Oh you know him tooüòÇüòÇ
and, matpat, i had this theory in my head for YEARS. in fran bow, in the beginning when fran takes the med's, the doctor is able to see her even though she is in that diffrent world, HOWEVER later, when you put the keys back onto the hook at the reception, the nurse doesnt see you, even though right after you do it, she sees them like she was staring that way the whole time
Simple game theory boom solved it
i nofficated also YOU can play it!!!
Tip do another destiny video theory
The funny thing is that I (almost) never watch/play whatever the theory is about.
I Never care about spoilers, if I wasn't already knowledgeable about the topic. Which I usually am not.
Care‚Äîdancing‚Äîsign?
Marvin is Baldi part 2
Something pyro can‚Äôt do
0:00 Oh Noe
Love All Your Videos MatPat Keep Up The Good Work
Paul is actually clare, just changed. Its the game's way of telling paul the brainwashing processes and gender reassignment.
To be honest it's dumb to think an ai predict human behavior without human intervention first and human intervention means the algoritm gets affected and modified by the feelings of the creator so you get a Karen that looks hyper similar to the creators idea of Karen but not the real Karen at the end machines are just dumb calculators
OMG PETSCOP 2
we need a hat
Yes! I really missed that "old" style of your films' editing.
Yo, I love code bullet
You cannot create PlayStation game

Only Playstasion Staff Can Create such game like Gta San Andreas or other playstation 1 game

PlayStation have this special DVD

That only support Playstasion games

But by creating them without the Special DVD for PlayStation is wont work 


Maybe is animated  

Like Dark souls Cuphead animated gameplay

Just like mat pat said on the first video 

Is a animated fake gameplay
Petscop is complicated? laughs in homestuck
Y'know, if the world lasts, tech like this can be used for 2000s gen killers and solve what might become cold cases if they have any internet profiles.
hey did you seen markiplier's Damien ..
you were quite right
0:00-0:20 WE ARE IN THE BEAM
I GOT ALL MY FNAF PLUSH
So i know that this has nothing to do with petscop, but with Deltarune and Undertale. In Undertale when you with Papyrus to hang out, in the 'battle' area in the bottom left there is an egg, and then it the secret area in Deltarune where you get the egg behind the tree. Now i thought this was a cool little secret that toby left. And then when you put the egg in the refrigerator it could symbolize for the au's. You put in one thing, and then some one makes a another verson of it. Making like a copy. I don't know i though it was cool. Nice Video btw.
How you make that intro?
Hey today is my bday thanks for posting a petscop video that <3 mwahh

Edit: I say this because it's my favorite theory series.

Edit 2: wow ok this is the most likes I've ever gotten especially so quickly thanks <3
Yooooooo i just figured out the most dastardly discovery of petscop history. its called petscop cause you cop pets. I'm 14 and this is deep
But we have a hulk.
i binged all the petscop videos at 11 p.m at night wish me luck going to bed
Hey I have a thing for Fnaf. I was watching Mark on Sister location and the voice from the second night told him :It will be over soon. and I remeberd that lefty has a voice line in UCN :shhhhhhhh... It will be over soon. Isn't that strange?
Not being a real game, but a youtube series about a fictitious game, should this not be film theory?  Whatever.  Like I care.
@Pyrocinical Hey bruv
am i the only person who doesn't know petscop?
at least you made a second video , and came back . Not like somone les  KAUGH .. pyro KOUGHT sinical
you should've collabed with pyrocynical for this smh
Are we ever going to get a new hello neighbor theory
CREAPYPASTA!!!!!!!!!
Pyro, where is Petscop 2?
Never mind mat...
YAAAAAASSSS Petscop is back!   I love it, thank you Matpat.
In the same vein of things, I think Matpat should take a closer look at training artificial intelligence. For example, the Xenoblade Siren kit states that the AI that was designed to control the Trinity Processor were raised in a virtual reality.
Its just a theory, a welcome theory
What a dragged out episode, don't do us like that and leave us hanging
R.I.P Scott
Game Theory: posts anything about Petscop
Pyrocinical: Thief.
wait, this isn't pyro
16:44 looks like my cat for some reason
Yay! Pyro has been saved!
Still waiting for pyrocynical to do petscop.
Finaly some traditional game theory again!
Petscop should be a real game
5:47 I actually find that Sonic face is funny
Its my first time seeing petscop and I thought it was a 3DS game.
Petscop 2 when
This is such an underrated series
Compared to the other games that get theorized
Finally my boy cb got a shout out
do more undertale theory's?
first of all the YouTube algorithm
Did we actually get a 4 min ad at the end
I instantly thought about Code Bullet as soon as you were talking about AI
So is pyro releasing petscop 2?
PLEASE PYRO HOP ON THE TRAIN LIEK YOU ALWAYS DO
Someone tell me in the comments who uploaded the petscop videos
I love Code Bullet too
Petscop 2
im so scared lmao
But we have a hulk.
Petscop 2?
97%: Pyro petscop 2??
2%: hold my beer

Nobody knows
Petscop 2?
15:13 welp
Ayy code bullet got a shout-out nice

MatPat: ‚ÄúSeasick butt‚Äù
No one: .....
Me: dying for 5 minutes of laughter
No I want the merch but I can't get it.
Wish I could but got no money üò¢
Yes code bullet!!!!!
I was waiting for this video so hard
Matpat:no one has actually talked about this
YouTube recommendations: lets talk about that.
Oi PYRO!
2:36 for the Pen Is Care
W h e r e i s p e t s c o p 2
My guess is that a guy decided to make a fake let's play of a dark story. And that's waaaaay better than the sonic movie
Hello, you know who‚Äôs beautiful 
Read the first word



Don‚Äôt get wooooshed
so Marvin is talkin bout his generation
What‚Äôs 9 + 10

I probably shouldn‚Äôt watch this before bed but oh well ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
OH MY GOD YES! YOU DID IT!!
Through this vid i was smiling so wide, amazing dude!
I watch petscop 17 or 19 and
The end has a grave
Of Lina leskowitz.
Who is she
Mom: Hey let‚Äôs get you some clothes from pink!
Matpat off in the distance holding up a sign for merch advertisement
Me: I CAN HERE THEM CALLING ME MOTHER.
This is easily one of the most complex ARGs I‚Äôve ever seen..and I love it
Hey does destiny/destiny 2 have more lore then world of warcraft?            ( I'm on the destiny side.)          (My Dad's on the world of warcraft side.)
i knew code bullet was coming up the second he mentioned learning algorithms, yes boyyyyyys
Hey just a headsup, you forgot to link Code Bullet in the description.
THE THROW BACK TO LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE!!!!
this one was really good. can't wait for part 2
I've been so busy watching GMM that I missed this theory!!! AHHHHH
Awwwwww, poor MatPat. Only one in the win column? Surely there's more than that.
This is only semi-relevant, but I LOVE Code Bullet and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs getting some recognition
someone should tell the modern rogue guys that matpat is working with dresspants robotman for intro's
hey i'm already subed to code bullet
Codebullet ‚Äúwhen the Ai overlord takes over ill be the first one to go eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehh nope ill be alright‚Äù (edit added) well with those terrible fashion, the AI overlord will no touch you üòÇ ‚Äújoke people‚Äù
Of course you know Code Bullet. I love you even more.
Uuuuu I'm bout to In A do a fortnight season 9 theory about the bunker
Matpat:i want to make another petscop video
Freddy Fazbear:hold my pizza
Persona 5 why do the characters bleed when they rip the masks during awakening?
‚ÄúFinally finished our Easter egg hunt‚Äù
Well, about helling time.
Nearly 4 minutes of merch plugging... great job!
Seeing the light thing on the TV at the end all I could think of was the Riddler from Batman Forever.
YAAASSSS! I love this style of Game Theory, glad it's back! Sorry matpat, I love your face but this style works so much better‚ù§
Finally! I‚Äôve been waiting for this since the new ones came out! Thank You!
Dang, MatPat is making Petscop videos before Pyrocynical makes Petscop 2 üòÇ
Matpat!!!! Your channel game theory was just on the raidio for being correct about people.
Matt, what's that small black box on your video?
Is the mirror of truth from kid icarus really true
Is it just me or should the creepy AI sound be a new Game Theory maskot and keep making cameos in future eps.
Petscop 2 is finally here!
5:39 it‚Äôs way less creepier with the Japanese/European soundtrack. It‚Äôs pretty funny, actually.
Why do i keep watching this series it gives me anxiety
i think matpat knows the guy who made these. they don't have enough views to really focus this many episodes on
or maybe he just got hooked on something he stumbled across
I know I'm about a year late, but can you do one on little nightmares?
Omg mat pat you watch code bullet too he is such a good coder
The like to dislike ratio is currently 100 to 1.
Nice.
I really appreciate this old video style. No green screens
have you seen the lore of magic the gathering?
Now a theory on either FRAN BOW or the little thirsty demon!
Mattpat for how many hours you put into these things, thank you for all of your scary theories.
You should do an episode in how hard Izuku would have to cry to push him into the ground during the sports festival arc
I think petscop can be interpreted many ways, for me I think the best theory is from Noir Ascii
I love Game Theory A LOT !! The murch is great and all but.. I AM a HUGE film buff !! Do you have Film Theory merch ??
MatPat actually mentions the Youtube channel Code Bullet.
I‚Äôm early yes



‚ÄòFirst‚Äô 


Oh 



‚ÄòSecond‚Äô



Oh Fudge
The green guy 
Right there on petscop
Its doulingo
The "Infinite is Fun" is prob one of the most known.
Damn five uploads on my birthday
I love Code Bullet. I have been watching him for a while. AI learns to play pool is my favorite.
Watching chills.
Now I can say I'm unscareable

DeadSocial is going to recreate Black Mirror's Be Right Back.
Can you please do a friend a theory Like what is she actually crazy or did that all actually happen
Mat pat had to whip out the poop sock for this one
This again?

Time to give myself nightmares again...

Tbh I love this series because it‚Äôs so scaryyy
Yo give credit to code bullet for that image üòÖ
Oh.
I'm early.
You should do a theory of the Alan Wake games
You should make a video on how long Jonesy was in the cave
for those who don't know, that Sonic CD Easter egg was suppose to be goofy not creepy the music that plays in the background is the boss theme and depending on which version of the soundtrack you listen to (American or Japanese) it could be goofy or creepy (Japanese is the goofy one) the more you know!
1:31 
Here people say that I MatPat out my runtimes.
Why the guy in the thumbnail looks like Ozzy Osbourne? XD
Ooh. I I didn't know Matpat was a fan of Code Bullet. Nice.
Hi matpat theory idea:  you should do a theory about baldis basics
paul already made petscop 21 while pyro hasn't even done petscop 2
I watched the first game theory of this game last night and that night I dreamed that I bashed my hand into smt and only my pinky finger started bleeding and never stopped..that was the entire dream. I just wanted to share that. Have a nice day
no one:
pyrocynical fans: * screenshots *
Game Theory posts
Me: I don‚Äôt care if I don‚Äôt know the game I‚Äôm watching it he is the best
Reminds me of Black Mirror, especially the ‚ÄúBe Right Back‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhite Christmas‚Äù episodes

all they see you is code
I swear I'll die if I see that "hello notification squad" comment
No its not haunted
For some reason, I thought this was the last episode, I'm so relieved that it isn't.
you referenced fnaf
Dude I‚Äôve been watching Code Bullet for SO LONG before you pointed him out. He‚Äôs awesome!
(Before watching) you made vedios talking about the game being haunted (after watching) oh...
thank god you mentioned code bullet... the minute you started talking about learning algorithms, i instantly pictured his videos of programming AI to beat games lol...
Wonder if you will make a Detroit Become Human theory
sad A.I. reminds me of the cornflakes humonculas tm

its life endless pain...

: D part of a balanced breakfast!
Could it be? The return of PNGpat?
When u go to buy theory wear and then u see the price
Hamon was invented in 100,000bc by mike hannond when he tried to breath twice at once
So you're saying...



Marvin has an AI version of himself that was only seen a generation ahead of the one he was alive? This is why I watch your videos.
Tf2 has way more lore than this
for some reason, the intro reminded me of how Spongebob greeted Mr.Krabs during that episode where Spongebob 'forgot' to put pickles on a Krabby Patty.
Dead social is pretty spooky ...
If I die I die no pretend me
Can you tell pyrocinical to make petscop 2?
Wow this game is back?  Dam
You should check out Ai Angel!
Did mat pat kickstart the uploads
Please keep this format alive
Pls stop with the creepy intros
Not gonna lie the video was underwhelming
I dare you to cover bubblegum simulator in roblox







EDIT:actually more like ruin bubblegum simulator for me in roblox
Honestly so glad you shouted out code bullet. He is one of my favourite youtubers!
Matpat always gets in to deep
Then turns out the ending is just it
sick a shout out for code bullet.
thank you mat my man you just reminded me of a good channel to watch.
^^ *
Watch and make a video on, ‚ÄúDAMIEN!!!‚Äù
I love this series, but damn the thumbnail! It‚Äôs scary üòÇ I‚Äôm that one chicken who nearly doesn‚Äôt watch a video because of its thumbnail!
Dude when he yells a minute and a half it was 1:30 this is hilarious üòÜ
Not gonna lie, Mattpat, but I love your openings.
At 15:10 if you put it on .25 speed you can actually see the f-word (could say it, but respecting Mat) in the next few seconds
Heh I like the Game Theory stand thing very cool
Petscop 2 when?
This is why i love my recommendations
THUMB HOLES, BABY.

Also, happy Mothers Day, Stephanie!!!
Hurray, I'm not sleeping tonight
OMG I watched code bullet before he had a mic!!!!!!!!!!!
Now I see what he is talking about with the very difficult edits so shout out to the editing team for doing a fantastic job
This reminds me of an episode of black mirror it was called "White Christmas" basically a guy puts a suspects subconscious into a machine to try and solve a murder
omg i LOOOOOOOOVVVVEEEEEEE codebullet
PETSCOP 2
When Petscop has more lore than Marvel

I see this as an absolute win
HURRAY YOU WENT BACK TO THE OLD STYLE OF GAME THEORY?!?üéâüéäüéâ to be honest it‚Äôs not that I like to See you MatPat it‚Äôs just I prefer the old style and was afraid that new style was permanent. Keep making Theories!!! The internet loves you!
So... That opening "Hello internet welcome to Game Theory..."



r/ihadastroke
As soon as he said "25 pages if notes" I KNEW it was a part 1.üò≠
And once again, Game Theory has beaten pyrocynical to a petscop video.
Matpat:Sega what were you taking
Sega:Aparentlly everything
So it took 999999999..... 9999 generations to beat 2048, heres the question, how many untile 4096?
quick answer to the video title : no.
Where are the memes?
So you blame us for your lazybones you have a kid now dude
"Is This Video Game HAUNTED?"
Me: Ya think???

Edit (after actually watching the video): Ya, nevermind. I'm convinced it's not. Lol
A decent substitute to Pyro's Petscop 2. I mean it's better than nothing
where is intro????
St Louis Style Bagel
Not petscop again! I literally cried myself to sleep and it was really scary ahhh not again don‚Äôt do it again please
matpat I thank you for you every day hardworking I'm only 11 so I still have a lot to learn and you help me do deep looking into on my favorite games so thank you.
matpat I thank you for you every day hardworking I'm only 11 so I still have a lot to learn and you help me do deep looking into on my favorite games so thank you.
I‚Äôve watch code bullet for a while now. His video are basically always interesting to watch.
3:55,Petflix,only one game but many,many secrets and lore!!!
I think it is haunted by Maggie maggie
OMFG YEAS!!! CODE BULLET!!!
WE LOVE CODE BULLET!!!!
My boy Code Bullet getting a mention was a highlight of the vid for me. I love watching his videos and I‚Äôm glad you like his vids too!
can you do a hollow knight theory please?
this oughta hold me over until petscop 2
You Make me feel scared my heart is racing and i think im having a heart attackl
"I'll admit it I'll admit it" I...got chills watching this
The original PlayStation running all this, nah mate. XD
5:45 they guessed what would happen if we tried a real life Sonic o.o
Personally I like MatPat on screen a little more as it feels a little more personal like a friend telling you a thing he just thought about and wanted your input but that being said I don‚Äôt dislike the original style that most people seem to prefer
It night time help
THERE'S BARLEY ANY PETS BUT THE TITLE HAS PET IN IT
I'm glad they went back to the old style of videos. Matpat I like your face; but there's so much charm in seeing a .png of you instead of the live video. Sorry editors, I know that makes the job a lot harder
Pyro: FINALLY! I'm almost done with petscop 2-
* gets five notifications *
Pyro: ...?
OH COME ON!!!
I‚Äôve watched the whole series today just to understand
PLEASE DONT SKIP BY THIS COMMENT (you have every right to i just want this to get out)

Okay I have been binge watching MatPats videos. and i think that that the editors deserve more credit. Not from Mat he obviously appreciates them but for the viewers. A lot of the viewers (not all) don‚Äôt really think about the editors. They do a lot of work. I don‚Äôt mean any offense and I apologize if i came across as rude. I just believe that the Editors need a shoutout. So here you go GT/FT/GTLive editors. Thank you. Thank you for working so hard on these videos. I honestly really enjoy them. These videos also have some of the best editing and style I have ever watched. So again thank you and don‚Äôt stop doing what your doing. (Unless you for some reason want to.
i read the  blocky game theory as geometry
Me coming to you
MatPat, when will you reveal that you‚Äôre the one developing this ‚Äògame?‚Äô
i definitely  did not expect code bullet to make an appearance
Kinda like BaTIM ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î might play again l8er
I bought the Player Jacket!
The theory is actually 15:29 long.


the rest are just ads,
Horror game with lore 
Matpat:allow me to introduce myself
Petscop 2 can finally be made.
We did it reddit.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IMMA CONVINCE MY MOM TO BUY ALM THAT STUFF!
Your intros r giving me chills wow help
glad more people will know about my boy code bullet
Wow petscop dropped more videos then James Charles subcount
I love that you‚Äôre back to the old video style!!
BRUHHH THE INTRO VOICE!!!! Becky lemme smash
Noone:

Matpat: Is this videogame haunted!?
You can‚Äôt spell Petscop without S.C.P? Hey but thats just a theory, a GAME THEORY!
Mat- Sega... What were you taking??... 
( around 5:50)
I died üòÇü§£
But that is just a theory...
a gay theory
5:40 knew it for a long time XD
Imagine getting frisky in bed and you strip and see her game theory underwear.
*agressive and long sniff* HOLY BAJEEBUS FINALLY
Found secret at 3:39 ?
why does Paul just look like jacksfilms
Nothing better than a new Petscop theory while I wait for my surgery
Say the line
Any one
Just say the line
Can you determine the value of a stud in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga?
I'm so glad more people will watch code bullet, Honestly one of my favorite youtubers right now.
Omg I love Code Bullet but he keeps taking and using things that aren't his(The CinemaSins/AnimationSins intro) and there is one video where he has lots of cursing in one place that is uncensored. Also, check out some of Carykh's videos. They do coding and algorithms too sometimes, though not as often.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING ANOTHER PETSCOP VIDEO
Sorry I got a little excited here, this is one of my favorite mysteries on the internet, and I'm sure a lot of us Petscop fans wanted more discussion and attention to this amazing creepy pasta.
Much love <3
make a game theory on Fran Bow, there's a new game being developed that take placed in the same universe as Fran Bow. You played the game but you never made an ACTUAL theory video on it
The Japanese just said "Sega Entertainment" in katakana.
This theory was amazing and well put together, had some great proper research. And that theory lamp thingo, I‚Äôm making a LED acrylic lamp like that in wood works this month
The game theory parody of the petscop title was so cool üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
YES MATPAT KNOWS ABOUT CODE BULLET!!!!!!!
YEEES!!!!
So, it's crazy because the stories might actually be real stories
Is this game haunted by the children of the damned? If Marvin had lived, would he have crucified us all?
Not even pyro will do Petscop 2
Why does mat expect me to pay 60 BUCKS for a HOODIE?

I could buy a decent Triple A game and some candy with that cash.
Robot: new theory merch



My head: 
Damn, still not Theory Thong :-(
Ah yes the haunted tale of petscop 2. (Pyrocyincal reference)
Check the descriptions for Petscop 1 , 5 , 11 , 17 and 21 if you haven't already. You will find some intresting information there
pokemon+fnaf=petscop
11:33 not important but dat ma b-day
LETS GO FOR CODE BULLET
Nobody:
MattPat putting Rainer up close on my phone screen at 11 PM:
I LOVE CODE BULLET! ps this is pretty interesting
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NEXT EPISODE?? 
I WAS SOO INTO IT!!!!!
YEEEEEEES i was just thinking about code bullet
should a series like this not be on film theory since it isnt a real game? I'm not saying it's bad, I love it, but just curious
Everyone keeps talking about petscop 3. Isn‚Äôt this petscop 5?
I honesty forgot about that sonic time.
15:00
I love you matpat
And pyro still hasn't uploaded petscop 2....
I don‚Äôt know what to comment, so...
Good job with whatever you did today, whoever is reading this.
Pyroclastic needs to step up his game
I never got my fidget spinner i ordered from this channel.....

I love these kind of theories üëç
We‚Äôre still talking bout petscop?
Matpat calling out YouTube for demonetizing his video causualy
Dead Social is basically the company from Black Mirrors be right back episode
This was a really good episode! Great job, keep up the good work!!
My boi CODE BULLET
YESSSSSSS
Matpat, I love this series, but plz change the character things that represent characters. Specifically Reiner. It honestly is way creepier than it needs to be.
"BUT, is this video game HAUNTED??"



No.
This is me: haunted game  sign me up


Also me 


Haunted game do we have to do this

This meme has joined the chat

Everybody left the chat

 
I gotta go to bed in 20 minutes... not liking this title and thumbnail...üôÉ
Pyrocinical Petscop 2
My main man Code Bullet getting a shout out, hell yeah.
Wait I thought that Petscop was a film theory, but hey that just a theory a game or a film theory.
Short answer: No. 

But DAYUM I love me some GT.
It really sucks cause I live in Sweden and the shipping cost too much for me to buy itüò©
Video: IS THIS VIDEOGAEM HAUNTED??


Me: um no
damn, I didn't expect to ever see codebullet appear on game theory!  he's really good
He really has scp-082 in the thumbnail
Did I just got an Ad, for a game called "Adventure Communist"?
At 3:17 it shows my computer's background
Well poop... It's hard getting merch from anothet country here in Brazil lol
Oh nice you shouted out code bullet he deserves it he is a awesome YouTuber
I was a bit iffy of your other petscop theories but this one I can 100% get behind!
I definitely need that shirt üëÄ
Pyro won't make another petscop by mat will
PYRO YOU NEED TO MAKE PETSCOP 2 THIS MAN HAS ALREADY INFILTRATED THE HEAD QUARTERS AND MADE 2 PARTS BUT NOW HES GOING TO STEAL YOUR EPICALLY MADE MERCH. PYRO. WE NEED YOU.
You should make a theory on Zero from boarderlands 2 in celebration of the boarderlands 3 coming out soon.
I'd like to see your take on the topic. :)
I found that game is VERY CREEPY
Perfect timing. I was on my way to poop.
Marvin is purple guy's cousin am I right mat pat plssssssssssss reply you know FiveNightsatFreddy's
You think the channel uploading in monetized
are you finally going back to your old style? Thank god!
Petscop 2
matpat when I was leaving school I saw a baby drinking diet coke lol
Honestly, I love code bullet, have done since his voiceless videos, he is super intelligent and teaches how algorithms and ai works but doesnt make it boring.
Just check him out, he does swear though so if you care about that maybe don't...
me seeing the video in my notifications well there goes sleeping tonight :,)
The... "Intro" was intriguing, kinda activates the valley of the unncanny
Nice video Game Theory and can you make a THEEEEEORYYYYY on TF2? PLS!!! On anything! On Saxton HAAAAAAAAAALE or Australium.
Pyrocynical: Making petscop 2 to match with The Game Theorists

Matpat: n o
Does Rayners drawing looks like jackfilms? Or is it just me
Pyro will never make Petscop 2.
Omg, Theory wear is so awesome. When I first saw that light on GTLive, I thought it was more 3-dimentional, but it's still look cool.
Petscop is Monika confirmed.
You're the reason why Pyrocynical won't make Petscop 2.
9:30 Iknew, you would mention code bullet here^^ I love that guy^^
Dude! Great to see others are watching CodeBullet! His stuff is sooo cool!
0:01 when you looking through mobile apps
When he started talking about the AI I had realized what was happening in the room thanks to Code Bullet and then he actually pointed him out! hell yeahhh
of all the theories here, the petscop videos always creep me out the most
Why is that all of all of your videos give me CHILLSüò∂
THE OLD STYLE IS BACK YAYYY! Sorry MatPat you‚Äôre still beautiful
I keep forgetting that you‚Äôre not playing this game‚Ä¶
Matpat: makes 20 min long video of evidence, explanations, detail and planning

Me, a complete moron who‚Äôs watching the vid and feeling smart: 

There‚Äôs a twist........
First of all because of the youtube algorithm
Nice to see FlatPat back in action.
(Referring to the 2D image of Mat resting his chin on his hand)
i love code bullet!!!!!!!!!!!! my fiance and i watch him. hes awesome!!!!.


petscop is a good series to watch, and i didnt know about deadsocial thanks matpat for the information!!
I love your content so much keep up the good work, but where do you get that computer voice from the beginning of the video?
MMMM, I am so excited that you're continuing on with your theories with Petscop!
That sonic CD screen
My God
Every comment is based on pyrocynical not uploading petscope 2
I know how this AI stuff all ends: Xana
So guys we did it, we got Petscop 2 to come out on Pyro-- OH this is MatPat not Pyro! Ah, silly mistake. Carry on...
Beat pyrocinical to new petscop
Can you please please please do video about nesting godzilla game?
FINALLY! CODE BULLET GETS NOTICED!
You should make a social media theorists channel
and you can make videos about rumors on social media like TheSunVanished
Salad fingers
Petscop hold my beer
When a hoodie is more expensive then the massive night light.
Note: The Epiphany Light has a cup for a winner, so why should I get to have one?

Next time on gammme theory i will solve everything
Thanks for calling out CB
Omg pyrocynical finally after all the wait you‚Äôve released petscop 2

reads who made it

This is not epic
I just saw a business called Pestop, which is Pest Stop. Maybe there is a message hidden in the name?
Ok now give us petscop 3
You came back to old animaitons?? NO GREENSCREEN PLS
i just noticed that gt's videos are becoming longer....
Matt. Pat. It took you FOUR MINUTES to get to the meat of this thing. FOUR.
when you can't milk fnaf theories anymore so you must find other ways to get quick cash
0:00 meme man theory
The merch is so cool
"Uploading a video like, every four months." Sounds like steven universe tbh.
3 views and 83 likes what is YouTube on
Damn matpat already at 3 and pyro hasnt made petscop 2
I thought pryocincal was supposed to do this
OMG!!! I'm sorry for talking/typing so much, but me and one of my best friends made some new theories. She convinced me that Pink Tool might actually be Michael. I think it could also possibly be Belle, though Michael seems more likely. It might even explain the improper grammar! He was very young, so that might be the reasoning behind it! I just wanted to put this out there, so, what do you think?
Please do theory on Damien by Markiplier
3:18 I played it and Siri turned on I did it a few more times really creepy.
Petscop has been one of my favorite YouTube series since Don't hug me I'm scared
Think you nailed it, honestly. Good work MatPat
I'm still waiting for petscop 2.

Plz pyro I know you're out there
Getting alot of Netflix Black Mirror vibes here...
pyrocinical be like: please let me upload videos myself thank you
S A N T I A G O
7:38 That would be me
7:43 And that to XD
3:39
I thought he was going to say "Free to PLAY"



I got really excited.
MatPat: Claims he doesn't pad runtime

Also MatPat: LOL 5 MINUTE AD FOR MY MERCH
not just a great theory but love the new merch
so glad you shouted out bullet hes super funny and deserves more subs
I love this editing style! Please go back to this!
You had your chance pyro. Love ya Matt!
holy frig! this explains alot.
Yay! I‚Äôm early! Wait, oh my goodness I am literally forming a Theory in my head right now.
Get ready for a theory of DAMIEN, MatPat!
Me: super tired, about to take a nap
YouTube: new game theory video
Me: nevermind
Edit:people liked my comment? 12 people!? That's more likes than I've ever gotten
3:39 Yay I Found A Secret YAY
Code bullet hell yeah
Thanks for the nightmares! Nah.... JK. Great vid bro.
i‚Äôve been waiting for this!!!!!!
SICK CODE BULLET CALLOUT! MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER EVENT IN HISTORY! Now all you need to do is redo your For Honor video with Shadiversity
God the visuals have come so far, Well played GT, keep it up!
My guy Code Bullet got mentioned! FINALLY!
Friend: yo wanna play some petscop?
Me: yeah of coarse!
brings a cross
man...code bullet is one of my favorite channels
Back to the old video style! YES!
I already subscribed code bullet! I whach him for a year now!
Yeaaa boiisss btw I already watch code bullet
here's a theory: the game is made by Matpat from the feature to satisfy his endlessly growing hunger for mysteries so keep his attention away from the cheat code of the universe that when used destroys everyone
Code Bullet!!!!!
*Reads Title*
Me: Uh, yeah?
I'm early!!
Edit: Imagine if the maker sees this and makes another episode just to crew Mattpat
ANOTHER ONE YAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY
The petscop theories are some of my favorite in your repertoire.
NUGGETS!!!!!!!!
robots JUST FRIGGIN ROBOTSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
My wife left me
You literally already wrote like....five theories on this game, you know damn well it's not haunted. This video is just one gigantic piece of lazy filth clickbait, and I'm convinced this is clickbait for actual babies.

I don't care that I gave you a view and a half a minute of watch time, you have millions already. You don't need to depend on stupid clickbait when you actually have talented people that work for you.
Gamescop ‚Ä¢-  ‚Ä¢
ayyy i've been watching code bullet since he had like 250k :D
"the pieces are in place" should be your catchphrase when you think you've solved a mystery
Your theories are awesome!

‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíö
FINALLY someone who uses YouTube on dark mode!
"Reads a title"

 OF COURSE!
17:15 i'm pretty sure it just says "game theory", my guess is purely based on where it's placed and the number of letters
13:25 Is that a destiny reference to TR3-VR?
7:54 and C) they are game journalists
66E like...
I love code bullet and when game theory mentioned him i was ecstatic
game theory: Half life 4 is announced before petscop 2 is released
I could tell the code bullet thing was coming
Well pyro, where is petscop 2 now?
Pyro its gonna remember this
Next episode?! Why do you do this to us lmao
Stork theory having game
No show socks for people who wear vans like that
Matpat...this is why i love you...
2:18 FNaF is taking over MatPat's life. There's no escape.
Top 50 comment yay notification squad
so eventually player three on the theorist symbol will be meme theory? or news theory?
This series isn't the fun, light hearted usual stuff but it's incredibly interesting. No matter what the subject is, you guys have consistently great content. Thank you!
Man we keep returning to petscop 
Good work
That sales pitch at the end was so well put together, that I'm leaving a dislike just because of it!
Finally i have been waiting for a petscop video for so long
Is that text to speech voice an altered version of meme man‚Äôs?
I like the og way of making game theory back
I love your videos, MatPat, but I've gotta tell you I'm getting real tired of the merch plugs. At this point, calling them "plugs" isn't even entirely accurate, you're putting straight-up three minute long commercials in your videos.
You already made a vid about this
I'm confused. Did pyro make the whole petscope arg, or did he just make the first vid about it?
Me: Doing Something Important 
Matpat: Say What Now
Also me: LIFE THREATENING ACTIVATE
Hentaihaven is back
I love code bullet
I love code bullet
we gotta protect Nial
Omfg tbh I don't like this series but I accidentally watch it so If I dont watch this it'll haunt me to watch it so I'll know how it ends
Pyrocynical, take notes
Do a Game Theory on Lobotomy Corporation please... it really needs it...
If this really is the end of this series, then pyrocynical has to make petscop 2.
MORE PET SCOOOOOP!
YAAAAY
is this petscop 2
Matpat uploads 5 petscop episodes before pyro uploads his second.


(Jk love ya pyro)
Youtube algorithm : evolves

Also Youtube : recommends Autotuned Cows
this lik my fav series it's creepy, mysterious, intense its  just soo GOOD i can't wait for the next video    !!!!!!!!!!

glad to see the old style is back <3
you must need to buy all his merch to solved the theory
Petscop 2 confirmed
When you're too lazy to watch Petscop so you just watch all the theory on it to get a vague idea.
still not petscop 2 but okay
as a person with experience in the paranormal, i can say that whoever did may have had some kind of contact with the other side
funny and original comment about Pyro and Petscop
Was that a MGMT referrance good sir
Hey Matpat! With the release of season 9 I‚Äôve got 2 questions that you may be able to answer: Would the volcano be able to power Tilted And The Mall / How many calories is Peely? And if Jonsey could survive. if you read this and do these, I will be very grateful
Still waiting for Petscop 2 though
Video: Is this game actually haunted?

WELL AT LEAST THE THUMBNAIL IS GOOD GOD
But damn,  I missed this series. Thanks GT, for the always perfect content!
This really reminds me of the creepy pasta BEN Drowned...

Even now we still don't get part 2 by pyrocinicall
Hey mat I dunno if you've noticed but I have. Every video that has the word demonitised in it, gets demonitised?
Hey the uhh fade uhm...


Just look at it: 15:10
It's back! Never gonna end
I love code bullet! I‚Äôm so glad you shouted him out!
Can I get top comment for once in my life
Reacting to The Text to Speech Voice at The Start of The Video

Petscop 2?
thumb holes? i though that's what butts were for XD JK though seriously,  might have to get me one that has built in thumb holes because that would comfort me a little
there's a new video of petscop posted a few days ago
What is the specific text to speech program used in ze intro
I really liked this episode! 
I think, you should stick with the newer style, where your real you is in the video and not the photoshop one! I really liked it
dang, I wish I had the USB theory light...
Hi, I don't know what to write here... So... Don't throw your pack of chips in the ground children... Its bad for the üåé
I'm glad he did this one the old-fashioned way. The "teacher-in-front-of-the-chalkboard" thing didn't work.
Me before seeing matpat watches codebulet: is matpat watching codebullet whit all that genartion
and pyro still hasn't done petscop 2
Stop making cool jackets I keep buying them.
who else thought about "the blue shirt kid' every time MatPat said algorithm
I have been a fan for some time, but i guess this is the day I'll go.
I dislike the ~4 min of advertising at the end.

Yea the joke's have been more thought trough, more in line with theme of the episode. But its just gotten more and more silly.
Nice intro tho :D
can you do a theory about how (physicly) strong is kirby
5:50 that actually looks better than the new sonic design
Yes, finally. Waiting for Mat Pat to give his opinion on Petscop Easter video party. Yaya
Mom come pick me up I‚Äôm scared
4 months for one video sound like my favourite animation you tubers 
(-=-)
Still waiting on doki doki part 2 :(
That thumbnail thoüò∞
Can you boycott Pyro for petscop 2
HEY MP HOLD MY PIZZA
Late time you said marvin wore a mask. And it was colored green. Ingame our head is green, SIMILAR HUH?



we are Marvin I guess
The more important question is, when is Pyro gonna release Petscop 2?
Pyro is being really slow if matpat made another one of these
After those awesome modeling photos, I couldn't not buy those socks!
Thanks for the subtitlesüòÑ
I love this kind of video without seeing matpat
Noooooo
Is this new dr.who???
Jeez dude u going crazy with this merch.
I LOVE CODE BULLET HE'S SO UNDERRATED OMG
Whaaaaat?! But I NEEEED to KNOW!!
So it's basically Black Mirror's "White Christmas"
can we use learning ai to replicate pyrocynical to make petscop 2?
Finally some one who talks about CodeBullet
pyro needs to do petscop 2
no more matpat on screen? or is that only for the more fun theories and the classic style is for the scary ones? ü§î
Imagine if matpat breaks petscop down and he becomesthe teason care is saved
Its over... HE said not remembering what FNAF thought him.
It IS NEVER OVER
8:53 Why the disrespect on Minecraft episode 999?
It's amazing to look at the major amount of detail given to not just Petscop, but how you analyze the whole thing.
It is haunted
OMG IM MAKING A ACRYLIC LAME AS A PROJECT IN MY DESIGN AND TECH CLASS
Matpat: <uploads petscop 3>
Pyro: Am I a joke to you?
"90 seconds of HOUSE" - MatPat 2019
Mom, can we have Petscop 2?

No, we already have Petscop 2 at home.

Petscop 2 at home:
I know most people are just trying to discuss the lore dump, but i gotta say...
YES! Code bullet is getting the recognition he deserves!
Nobody:
This comment section: pYrOCiNicAl!!!
If pyro doesn‚Äôt give us it mat surely will
Give credit to nightmind for making a bet with petscop that they wouldnt post before easter
The thing that haunted me the most is the thumbnail. yt suggests this video everywhere even tho i watched it lmao
Do this : how fast is the fastest sword user in aot(fastest reaction time, fastest sword swipes/slashes doesn't matter) and how fast is he/she
Bruh matpad is already in petscop 3
pyro: Wait, that's illegal
Imagine if some guy just made this to be a good scary game and seeing this:gosh graciousness wow
Code bullet is amazing definitely watch him
Best episode in awhile looooved it!!
Hey, MatPat, after 6:53 on the video, closed captioning seems to be no more, and I, Unfortunately, do not have earbuds or headphones on me while at school.
Who knew about the sonic sound because of space hamster?
 No, just me ok
Hello all peps Who are hiding in the comments. Dont worry! Grab A Coffee ‚òï and enjoy your time!
Hey Matpat look up NightMind he had down his own review on Petscop
Make this blue if you love your family‚ù§Ô∏è
üëá(I‚Äôm gifting subscribers)
The only thing haunted about Petscop is Pyro not making Petscop 2
Can you do a theory on Deep Sleep/ Don't Escape Series? The series' recently connected and it looks like the conspiracy stuff you're into. (Also a great fawkin game)
Holy heck I remember legends of the hidden temple.
Hah 
Cereal Abuser :D
I missed this format of filming. Good luck MatPat
why do i feel like Chris wrote the dialogue for the robot?
Great work, keep it up ^.^
This Vid just got Dark Matpat this is very Dark but not as Dark as Fnaf LOL
Let's get Code Bullet on Petscop 2
The only question I have left is where is Pyros video!?
Needed to rewatch all other petscop theories to get here cause im so focused on fnaf and bendy
I'm so glad you shouted out code bullet!!!
I'm super glad you shouted him out aaaaa
Madpat is a wimp he crys at up
I cant wait to die so a robot can create my content
I found the sonic sound board thingy on accident




I immediately stoped everything and turned off the playstation!
Imagine clicking on this video solely for bullying Pyrocynical in the comment section, I couldn't be happier
CODE BULLET!!! YES!!!
They did petscop 2!
Damn it Pyro with each passing days of no new petscop another episode of it pops up
Will you do a film theory on ash vlogs?
0:03
TheoryBoi2004 sends InternetGame0202 a mesage:
Hello.
Pyro: Petscop 2 is in progress

Mat pat: I‚Äôm about to end this whole man‚Äôs career
Mark and Jack should take note of your merchandise. Your merch game is ON POINT!
What if care grows up to be puals mom?
c o n s u m e
I'm really happy that lore theories are the same I missed this style of game theory
Also worth noting that the videos were released on Easter, the day that Jesus resurrected from the dead.
Infinite fun
Infinite fun
INFINITE fun
And then the killer sees this video, realizes hes being copied by an AI, removes all evidences, and the plan to catch/expose the killer fails. üëå
As soon as you started talking about AI I had a feeling you were gonna talk about code bullet
luv how subtitles just die.
Me: I am just going to watch a single episode of petscop

Matpat: i am going to end this man's career
Why does Rain have to be sooo creepy, and Marvin is literally a rock
Pyro is shacking right now
Ok I mean no disrespect when I say that I prefer this format (aka the original format) more than the recent one where MatPat was doing the theories infront of a green screen.
Mat Pat + Petscope = Dream come true
Matpat, I have a question is this a true story it seems to far fetched to me, but if you believe it then I believe it...
so it's black mirror ?
I just figured out something what are we looking for the c-level cartridge when there's obviously a second cartridge to the zoo level weight there's still another option finding the next option to the next area but what could it be I guess you'll have to figure out that is not my job it's yours try and figure it out on accounting plus I'm dying to know if it's truly impossible we have to find the other one what could it be
Where‚Äôs mass effect part 2?
Game theory : petscop 5

Pyrocynical : what about petscop?
Imma be real- I've never watched a petscop video, only these theories
Everyone: petscop comments
Me: thUmb hOLes
Ore is it just a fan made game that has never been released becuz...  I dont know
but if we're gonna start recreating people with ai, AT LEAST recreate technologically inept people, like me, so we don't end up with skynet
my chrismas theary wear did not arive i am so sad
No AI! Don‚Äòt do it Humans can‚Äòt survive in a perfect utopia! It‚Äôs even proven!
I m waiting to see comment

Why is creapy robot showing my picture

Fascinating stuff. Absolutely fascinating.

Why is annoying orange so good?
Maybe because of his no so punny pun jokes that spoil the pun out of everything
Sorry MatPat, but until you stop gendering your merch (particularly ‚Äògirls and boys‚Äò underwear!!) I cannot in good faith buy any. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Oh Snap Code Bullet.
What Pyro Couldn't do.
Matpat doing Pyro's twice now
I only came here coz everyone was commenting on CB's latest vid that Matpat gave him a shout out.  Now I'm going to watch Petscop.  Damn you Matpat!!!
i love the merch :3
THE UNDERWEAR‚ÄôS BACK!! And short socks...... And a flashlight. SWEET
Who else was reminded of Pamtri from the intro?
I know code bullet
If thanos can get into fortnight he can get to any dimension
heey you should do a theory on there is no game
Hey Mat, love your videos. 

But uh, maybe next video could you have a bit more theory, maybe a little less trying to sell me stuff?
Not one, not two... But five

Woah matpat keep it in your pants
...I need some more time to think...
What if this is a WRONG theory?
the alien language thingy just says game theory. damn that other full page was waay more fun to do.
anybody wanna team up for the treasure hunt?
Just don't pull a Mass Effect when you never released another episode
the end of the series next min you know Boom another video to unpack.
When is mass effect theory part2 coming?
Hey uh coulsld you make the rainer model not creepy

First he killed Mega Man and Mario, then Sonic with that one glitch and now this. Ridley is slowly murdering the whole cast.Thanks for featuring my video BTW :)
There's a slight mistake here in this calculation, MatPat. I can't guarantee you'll see it, but Ridley actually is crouching during his "standing" animation. To get an accurate estimation of his full height, one of his taunts actually shows him standing up straight. I'd recalculate this myself for you but frankly I'm tired and lazy. As far as calculations go with what you've used, it's solid, however it's likely much more damaging.
F is for fire burned down the whole town
U is Uranium bomb
N is for no survivors
here in the deep blue sea
SONIC: am the fastest thing alive


Ridley: drags  Mario across big blue without  any items


SONIC:  ?

MattPatt: Shows his fully recorded self in a game theory video
Me: Wait, thats illegal
2015: Purple Guy
2018: Thanos
2018 (also): Waluigi
2019: Ridley 






Why is everything dangerous PURPLE?
MatPat: can I interest you in a new game theory?
Me: I would love to but I should probably be studying for my physics final
MatPat: say no more
11:30 I high-fived you, MatPat! Don't worry, I like your puns!
When you measured the size of Ridley and Samus, you should have used Ridley‚Äôs down taunt. Because he literally just stands up straight, giving you his height in the game for free.
Came to hear a funny talk of the overpowered characters in Smash, left learning about the preference of airline pilots in their speed of choice.
This feels like it was intended to be presented by Austin.
Ridley: is low mid tier

MatPat: WHY RIDLEY IS SMASH‚ÄôS DEADLIEST FIGHTER
11:30 dont worry matt, i high fived the screen for ya
Seriously... Matpat Isabelle is not a Shiba Inu...she is a Shih Tzu!
Ridley drags you against air 
OMG THAT HURTS SO MUCH
Ridley:
If it breathes 
Break its knees
Wii Fit Trainer: Hold my sun.
Ok obviously my boi k king rool is gonna win.....he has the best spam attack
OwO wuts dis? MatPat doing math? Please do continue.
WoW seeing matpat fully recorded self is pretty strange to see when you used to I added my head on everything matpat 
And btw Love seeing something different for a time and I like your work
Mario: here we go!

Ridley: did you know the floor makes an excellent human cheese grater?

Wow over 150 likes thanks üòä
Is it just me or do you miss the photoshop matpat bouncing around on a lecternüòÇ
This is the type of theory I love. Combing math and science to show how deadly video games are
please make a game theory on persona 5!
I bought the Ridley amiibo the other day. Never played Smash, never got into Metroid. Maybe I should pick it up. Lol
I feel like matthew played a match against someone with ridley and lost, and now wants to prove that he actually won
So when are you going to name a number after Sakurai?
wario can ride on big blue with his motercycle in brawl and smash 4 just not ultimate
bowser might be able to survive this move, in some circumstances, shell stuff.
You might‚Äôve forgotten something
Ridley taunt shows him actually stand up
He's literally called the Cunning God of Death is this much of a surprise
I think this would be EXTRA painful for Wolverine.
Press Ff=un to pay respects ;)
Isn't Mach-Speed determined by height too? so how far up is the track?
Dang Ridley should really be a Mortal Kombat character in Mortal Kombat 11
I'm sorry, but Kirby with a gun is the deadliest
I think that samus could survive from That due to her armor and dark samus as well
Hi mat pat in smash ultimate Samus is actually heavier than Ridley but overall a fantastic video!
See Kabal's MK11 fatality for a visual example of what's happening to Mario's face.
At about the 8 minute mark, when Ridley kicked flipped a terrified Mario like he was a Tony Hawk wannabe, I just about died.
Comparison of Ridley and Thanos: 
Both purple
Both turn people to dust
5:05 "Palu-tenna"


Sorry I couldn't help but notice it
If you don't think that's affecting the numbers at all THEN YOU DON'T GAME THEORY BRO!!!
I just thought in sonic isn't sonic rly fast and egg man's vehicles are faster by a mile how fast can they go?
Can you do how fast is sonic in smash plz and Archie sonic in the comics
Matpat: ‚Äúlike any good racing game, it has a speedometer‚Äù
Mario Kart: Am I a joke to you
Ff

I actually didn't know about any of this... School never tought me this and it is actually really cool!
but smash isn't to scale, using the training mode you can calculate ridley's actual speed by taking ridley into the training stage, setting the speed to a frame per zl click, and press the button 60 times, since the game runs at 60 fps. Ridley actually only travels~25 meters in a seccond, so hes only moving at 90 km/h or about 55 mph. He'll still rip your face off, but its just not so extreme.
Anybody going to point out Matt calling Palutena, "Palu-ten-a"?
The first 10 seconds was enough for the like.
Wow it never crossed my mind that the character who Impales you with his tail, blows up spaceships and is literally called the cunning god of death is the most dangerous fighter.
With this new editing style, it looks like MatPat is hosting a kids science show on morning T.V. MatPat the Science Guy, get to it!
You need to make a theory about Mark since he made a new video
I just noticed his knee is also grinding the ground
canonically shulk is the strongest character in the game
Matpat: Ridley side b makes smash ultimate not e for everyone
Joker: GUN
Mat pat solved the hight meme..... Matpat is the God of theorys
Wouldn‚Äôt have been easier if he just used pixel measurements to determine the speed with a canon height of a character and then calculating the speed
Would this theory apply to sonic because of his resistant skin due to him being so fast?
Wow. Ridley belongs in Mortal Kombat. FINNISH HIM!!!
You used Ridley's idle stance and not the taunt where he stands up to full height so the damage would be worse
But if you use Ridleys taunt he becomes taller!
Mat can you please do a video on marks ego content because holy crap it is mind breaking
Nobody:
Me:
I think Samus could still survive because of the thick metal suit.
14:59 Wait, well...ridley is hunched over though. Whenever he uses his taunt, he straightens up his back
Holy cow, TGT used to talk and get to the point now he just talks for the sake of talking
Lil‚Äô Mac is also one of the most broken characters in spirit mode if you have the right spirits
Not to harp on past things but uhhh... Ya did actually cover Smash science once before! Remember Wario? Mr. Ten Feet Tal?
He should have used the taun where Ridley stands up to find his true height
looks at the title of the video

Me: He‚Äôs a damn dragon that‚Äôs why
wouldn't it be easier to take the lenght of the red withe segments by using a Character that you know the size of... and then determine how fast he moves?
Press Ff to pay respects.  I'm certain I'm going to regret making this comment.
Ridly:I will kill all! Even thanos! "Kills thanos"
I missed when you had the video edited with a cardboard cutout of you moving about the screen with changing faces, but I like this to, because it expands the limits of what you can be depicted doing (like scraping chalk and essentially your own hand on asphalt to prove a point (by the way I hope that hand‚Äôs alright now!), trying to get a high five from the audience, pointing at things, etc). Keep up the great work!
His down taunt makes him stand to his full hieght!!
You need to measure him by that!
someone might have mentioned this before, and I don't know if it affects things, but are you calculating ridley's full height, or just his normal standing height during a battle? when idle Ridley has his knees bent, which probably reduces his overall height by what I want to say is maybe a foot.

Also in response to not using character scaling to your advantage, I'd like to refer ya back to the Wario is 10 feet tall video in year one of game theory...I think it was year one.


Regardless that's a big ouchie, someone get the nintendo characters some bandages.
Hey, don't ever get that cheese grater near me or my furries ever again. √π.√∫
Wait a sec I thought Isabelle was supposed to be a Shih Zhu
How long would a human size banana last u like on fortnite
TO DEMONSTRATE THE POWER OF FLEXTAPE I SAWED THIS JIGGLYPUFF IN HALF
Its kinda funny listening to Matt talk smash Bros
I wish I were there right now cause I love math and science
Austin cameo explanation, when?
Matpat where did you get that! I want that now! Soooooo baddddddlllyyyytt
Ridley: pushes


Half the smash Roster: I don't feel so good
Hey man so if we lose skin but turtles and reptiles like bowser have thick skin and thick shells,so will the effect of f=un be the same
Ff good your really starting to turn up the heat with these puns
Use ridleys down taunt. He actually stands up.
Ridley is thanos's pet right there
6:05
Matpat: murders someone by throwing a calculator
Also Matpat: Laughs maniacally
Me: Watches Video

Also Me: Spams Chrom Up-B on Final Destination

Me: You were saying?
Who can turn people into dust faster, Thanos, or Ridley?
Who else high-fived the screen  
11:29
So does that mean Sonic is fast enough to keep up with sonic jets instead of running at 60 mph like the last sonic video you guys made or is their another video?
"Ridley is smashs deadliest fighter*
Ganondorf: sad Doriyah noises
I like the change of Matpat being a voiceover to being in the actual video. It feels more immersive. Geat jobs guysüòä
These videos are just way too long now
I have to say, I love the new theory editing style. The whole live action Mat is really different and I like it. I think mixing both the Editing and Mat (not using the same images always) is really really smooth.
Just imagine scraping your back on Big Blue, while a pirate space-dragon has his talons around you.
Nintendo: releases a game with a rating of E for everyone
Matpat: THIS IS THE DEADLIEST GAME OF ALL NINTENDO'S HISTORY
14:42




Fun Fact: Bowser is the Fastest Heavyweight.


(Not Counting Ridley's Side-B)
The (myoo) in the Force equation is actually a lower case m in Greek 
Science is not Fmn
Y'know‚Ä¶ If Ridley ever appears in Mortal Kombat‚Ä¶ That's his finisher. FATALITY!
You are correct. Isabelle would annihilate Palutena if the game were unbalanced.
I cracked up when ridly flipped Mario like a skate bord
Logically Sonic is the only one who'd survive it because of the friction he'd undergo running
Mat pat. The town in yokai watch 3 (peanuts berg) looks like the town in IT (derry)
18:08 mr.stark i dont feel so good
wait can king k rool survive becase he has a gold belly
That‚Äôs a weird way to say JigglyPuff.
Damien has come back Matpat 
Edit: Markiplier Theory Pt 2 Ff
Any smash character: *casually at 200%*
Ridley: Long live the king *Side B*
That's a Mortal kombat fatality there.
YES RIDLEY  MY FAVORITE  CHARACTER IN THE GAME GETS TO BE THE MOST BRUTAL WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Yugi: You activated my Ridley trap card! For every mph over 30 your character slides into the asphalt, they lose an ADDITIONAL 3.5mm LESS skin!
Kaiba: AHH! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!!
5:09 Actually, Isabel is a shitzu.
bowser is faster than falco, so your intro skit is invalid
Vincent is clearly the deadliest character.

Alpharad anyone?
Ridley is essentially the white supremist who killed someone by dragging
Isabelle: *Is a Shi Tzu*
MatPat: Isabelle is a Shiba Inu
Close Enough MatPat
14:48
Me waiting for that meme chance to see Ridley use his stupid tall boi taunt.
THANK YOU FOR THE SPACE BALLS REFERENCE!!!
Your jigglypuff is cheese grated into the ground... But your opponent is olimar XD
Do a Rugrats Game Theory
Everyone: "as a Ridley main I am pleased"

Spaceballs, the plush.
Me. Yogurt.
Ff
All we gotta know is, that's a LOT of damage.
Ridley: Rawr
Mario: Oh this‚Äôll be easy -
Ridley: SLIIIIIIIIDE TO THE LEFT
Pls help i just started playing smash, how do i play
Couldn't you also use the weight of the characters compared to each other to get ridley's weight? All of them have set numbers for weight, so just take the proportions for one character's recorded weight and smash code weight and apply it to Ridley,
"Electric rat"
Ridley? 400 pounds?  Ha hahaha 
I'll give him 50lb , maybe 70.
Matpat: Ridley is the most deadly character.

Me: laughs in low-tier
MatPat: Ridley is the mose deadliest & powerful character in the game.


Tier Lists: D TIER


Mr. Game & Watch: Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm looking forward to the next more deadly reveal about the Nintendo games.
His Hight changes more than bowser
Sonic: I'm the fastest living thing in the world.
Ridley's forward b move: Hold my beer!
Kirby survives planetary explosions, I doubt some pavement has anything on him.
but what if link uses his hylian shield to surf the ground hmm? didn't think of that now did ya




p.s. I know he doesn't do that, but what if he did
This video is really good, but



Isabelle is a Shizu.
Isabell is a shi-tzu
Ff Ridley's revenge
Matt Patt: Theory as to why Ridley is the deadliest character in smash

Me: He get a stabby tail
Scorpion: my fatality is dragging someone across the floor to scrape off their face!

Ridley: hold my samus
Forcing down full body weight... (Meta Ridley Skin Intesifies)
Wait, what about Ridley‚Äôs taunt where he stands straight up?
The real question is: how did MatPat get that piece of roadway??
No one:
MatPat: Ridley slides on other characters, thus grinding their bodies off
Ff
Oooohhhh this is why science is fun
Ridley is actually 4 meters 13 feet
Mat will you make another mario maker vid for the next game? cos there is going to be alot more block
Amazing as usual! But also guess what?
Sorry i was just asking if anyone has seen the new Petscop vids.
TO BE FAIR...

What were we expecting from Ridley of all characters?
Next, you should examine the speed and effects of Sonic running using the fastest spirits and power ups
Me: Let's check youtube before I go to bed watches the most recent Petscop video and this video ...welp, I don't need sleep to function.
Can you make a theory on Abzu ? Thank you, your videos are great, keep going ! :)
My one gripe is that when Mat measures his height, Ridley was definitely hunched over. Shoulda done the taunt where he stands up straight.
I miss cringy matpat with the cringe memes but this is new.....and ok. I feel like your doing more entertaining and less research,  I'm used to way more formulas and numbers in a topic like this. But I like it so far-ish

I dont feel as slow.....but I liked the extra research i had to do
Math school: OK let's do friction stufffff Me: well for homework we can watch GAMETHEORYYYY
14:44 bowser is slow


Then why does he run faster than half the cast?
Ff.


11:31
I want a high-five!

Pls stop showing your face. thanks
Everyone is concerned with the theory while here I am going SPACE BALLS
Breaking News...

Popular YouTuber Matt Pat has just been arrested for stealing asphalt from a Los Angeles road way. He is awaiting trial which it set for Tuesday of next week.
Ridley's way bigger than 125% of samus use his down taunt and you'll see
Ff
You're welcome, Matpat
But Ridley is legit slouching
Use the actual taunt that makes him stand up straight lol 
Sakurai said he‚Äôs like 12 ft tall in smash
When he was talking about who to choose,all I was thinking was "choose jigglypuff,choose jigglypuff"
Ridley still isn't strongest.
Rosalina can reset the universe.
Palutena is a god.
Kirby EATS gods.
where's the sakurillion combo for smash possibilities?
I got the most original vid idea?
How much stage builder combinations are there for smash ultimate
True story! Just one day before that video went live, I had an accident because of a Los Angeles pothole. Atleast now I know who to blame for my bleeding!

MAAAAATPAAAAAT!
Ridley literally has a taunt where he's standing upright.
This video:*exists*
Kirby with a gun: I‚Äôll stop you right there buddy
but then again youd still die if you were smacked with ganons gigantic sword
wait, but isn't that the height of ridly HUNCHING and not the height of him STANDING
KIRBY. PERIOD.
After watching this video I just had Ridley more and more.
Hey matpat I have a question remember that super Mario sticker game and super Mario color splash can you explain why they have 5 very good things like in the sticker game there are five good stickers and in color splash there are 5 important stars can you please explain?
Well...that explains all the pot holes I drove past in northern California
The normal force should be ridley's weight plus the weight of the character being dragged.
there is one fighter that can beat ridley





waluigi
Ridley is my main       




My friend's main jigglypuff





To be continued...
Matpat: FRICTION
Me: FRIK-TION
Sry mat but Ridley has an emote where he is standing up normally
I can't high-five you I'm sad
weird format, me no like
Why Ridley so deadly?
Two words:
Down. B.
Ff


Am I the only one who did this???
14:42 I'm sorry what? Bowser is in the top 20 fastest characters in smash
A good theory recommendation would be about octo expansion from splatoon 2. Like: who is actually commander tarter or what is agent 8 past life or even a good explanation on inner agent 3. I feel like this topic has been untouched for many months and with your great videos, and great explanations, a great answer will finally come up the the surface.
I think ridley is cool but he needs to stfu. His screams kill me especially  in metroid fusion
One of ridleys taunts is to stand up to full size, u could've used that to measure his height to samus
Ff
you get a high five from me mat o/
also thx for making a theory with f zero in it ive been waiting a year for it
Wait so riddly and walaluigi are the same height so walalugi cant be in the game but riddly can wtf nentendo
Ya know, the thing I hate about smash (ultimate) is that it‚Äôs hard to combo because the characters decide to FREEZE when you hit them also slowing down your attack (I think?) but it‚Äôs just hard to combo in the game
Ridley : I can grind you into shreds 

Kirby : survived a world ending explosion, killed multiple gods, and can swallow you whole

Ridley : starts sweating 

Kirby : POYO
you forgot to add when Ridley stands with his taunt
edit:oh someone already mentioned it
Well, except for the characters tougher than pavement. Like Bowser, Samus in her suit, and King K. Rool.
Room mate read the title and went on a full on tangent about how your calling Ridley the most deadly when the game has a character that can shoot missiles at you... I had to deal with this because of you Mat.. thanks
Can we get an Ff in the chat üòî‚úãüèª‚úãüèª
I miss old edited pat
The mat pat on the podium
Bruh. Ridley did a Varial with Mario's corpse
I mean the way Ridley just straight up pierce through your opponent Is bad enough
Matt says he wants to inject characters with super speed. It reminds me of an old flash episode about V9
Ridley is pushing down about 557.1 pounds of force
Nobody: 
YouTube ads: tuber simulater is still              R E L A V A N T.
He used the HighGROUND
Dude a lucina stabs you with a sword and bowser is burning you alive sooo meh ridely not so dangerus
I have a bad relationship with road rash, like I'm scared fisicaly, lucky for me I didn't luze that much of my self cause I rolled
Hmm





KILLS 3 CHARACTERS IN REVEAL TRAILER
11:53 to 12:23 is proof that Matpat has mental scarring trying to figure out Mario's height.
The scary part is the priority of Ridley side-b
I love the new face cam idea. Really works better than your closet!
Yo, I got a Game Theory for you.   The connectio  between the worlds of Kingdom Hearts and The Bouncer.
Also there are children who can control stars to hit opponents. Stars
(And by children I mean teens because Ness and Lucas are 13 )
Kirby:Did you do it?
Mario:Yes
Kirby:What did it cost?
Mario:Extreme Road rash
Ridley for Mortal Kombat
Ff means for freedom
After this I taught myself how to use Ridley.
Jokes on you I play as ridley
There‚Äôs also the fact that another of Ridley‚Äôs moves is him literally impaling you with his tail, but yeah.
i didnt know this even i use ridley as mi main LOL
Nice! A Spaceballs reference! I loved that movie!
season 9 by the way sorry for the spelling
Or by Austin: Ff means ‚ÄúRedacted‚Äù-‚Äôn Fun
RIDLEY: low tier
MATPAT: WHY RIDLEY IS THE DEADLIEST CHARACTER
You forgot to calculate Ridley's height for when he does his standing up straight taunt.
Maybe MatPat should do an up to date destiny theory videoü§îü§îü§î
If you think abt it Ridley is thanos because he‚Äôs turning Mario to dust
Matpat: says bloodbath
Me a geometry dash nerd: happyness noises
I wonder why the giant fire breathing dinosaur would be considered ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù

He's dragging you L0oO0OO0oo00oOongways
I used to always play Ridley when I played this with my friends
I have no complaints about this fact gametheory is revealing
im pretty sure the majority of moves would end badly irl
Are we really asking if a giant space dragon is more deadly than a couple of eskimo children with wooden mallets?





 We all know ice climbers are dangerous AF
11:30 I didn't leave ya hangin MatPat, I got you
riddle is hunched over while he is standing normaly, his up taunt however makes him stand. up so us that to measure his hight.
The way you pronounced palutena thoughüòÇ
you forgot the static friction part of that equation
Nintendo : " Matpat we need to talk "
That was a Ff =unyy joke
did you take in acoundent that Ridley is not even standing? im sure he is much taller than 238 cm (2,38m)
I actually main ridley
@11:31 Press Ff to pay respects
The best part is that this isn't even his final form. Ridley literally flies through space with his wings. Imagine a literal spaceship grinding you against the floor. 


Which makes me think... If Samus is able to combat a creature with strength and speed comparible to a space ship, how strong is Samus?
the big blue is a track in mario kart 8 deluxe 
(there is a difference called stats between them)
Ridley has a taunt where he literally doubles in size when he makes his back straight
ü¶Ä human flesh is gone ü¶Ä
Gave the video a like because of a science joke...



Have I been inaugurated into the nerd club yet?
What about Ridley's down taunt. He stands up COMPLETELY
Do  the Rugrats -theory
I have a theory: Is the tomodachi life island actually sustainable
Ff for my boi MatPat

This means Little Mac can run over 600 mph...
Speaking of deadly moves....When will we see Part 2 of the Indoctrination Theory for Mass Effect?
Game theory you should do a video on how much time was between fortnite season 8 and season 9 by measuring bunker jonesy beard
K guys, l have a theory: so you know how Ridley is purple and can rub you into dust in seconds? Do you know who also is purple and is known for turning people to dust? Thanos. That‚Äôs it. Ridley is secretly thanos.
One of ridley's taunts makes him show his true height
To anyone complaining about Ridley being taller than MatPat stated:
In this case it really doesn't matter. It just makes him even heavier, and thus, more destructive.
i know he'll never see this but i think you should do a theory on the flint knock pistol in fortnite








is there any gun that can actually launch you a couple feet in the air?
if so how much force does it take for a gun to launch you in the air?
and what type of bullet could do this?
I hate math but love science so Ff and üëè
My brain hurts
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things matt




Why you reveal that I am made of Diet Coke
Matpat: Explains how deadly one of Ridley‚Äôs moves is
Random character: Just jumps and continues fighting
Matpat‚Äôs Calculations: Am I a joke to you?

Edit: That‚Äôs too many likes in a small time span, thanks I guess?
I high fives the screen for you mat
Ridley for Mortalkombat DLC lol
Home run bats that gooify anybody hit.
Mario‚Äôs punch exploding people into blood and guts.
And now a fire breathing Space dragon using us as a eraser!
Moral of the story: The smash world is doomed and we can do nothing to stop it
So if Jokers face was dragged along the ground that will remove his mask summoning Arsene or literally any other persona like Yoshitsune to free him from Ridley
I've had a pretty rough weekend so far, nothing could cheer me up. 

As a Ridley main, you will not believe how happy this video made me in this stressful time of my life. üòÅ
I hate to say this but... Your calculations on Ridley are wrong. Ridley has a down taunt that makes him stand at (almost) full height. Making his weight EVEN heavier!
I loved it that you Ruined childhood games in till you did the tracer theory

You said Palutena wrong just FYI.
I knew Ridley being purple had to do with something..
 He can Thanos snap you with his side B, but on a 100% scale if he wanted to
Type Ff to pay respects?
Remember when Ridley aided in the attempt to wipe out the universe Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 style?
Do Simon Belmont's whip. How does that thing work?
Can you do a theory on borderlands 3? Like a list of characters and how they're linked to bunker and badasses and what you think would happen in the story line?
Ridley is slouching over, so he‚Äôs actually taller, making him more deadly
My god my spamming of ridley side b is finnaly legit
I know the truth of MatPat...
Dude. Shouldn't there be some warning at the start? Warning: Light to mediocre gore in this video. Viewer discrescion advised.
Petscop just release ep 17-20
Sonic: Gotta go fast!
Ridley: Gonna drag you fast!
Reminds me of that one move in Prototype 1 where you can surf on people over the asphalt, grinding them into red mush.
the road may be made out of asphalt but it's covered in a thin layer of pikachu
You know there's always a guy with a different calculation route then tries to assert it like it's the only correct thing, so let me be that guy. In calculating how fast the falcon flyer is going, how about  using the horizontal lines in the track of f-zero and the speed of the racecar to know HOW LONG the racecar is. Then calculate the time it takes for the stripe marker in the tracks in smash to pass the length of a racecar. Then work with the data to get the speed. I think it's a bit more accurate.
Matpat: ‚Äúwhere all my math and science nerds at‚Äù
Me: gives him a sympathy high five
Me: a cultured ridley main
My friends: Ridley is too broken
Me: no he isn't
Matpat: Why Ridley is Smash's Deadliest Fighter!
Sonic is the fastest side B the hole  time
For most of the video I was confused on how you were able to get on the big blue race track
Ff ya boi like math ü§£
Ok small nitpick but Isabelle is a shih tzu, not a shiba inu
1) As a Ridley main, this brings me much joy.
2) You definitely under-shot his height since he's hunched over most of the time. His down taunt makes him stand up straight and he's noticeably taller.
3) Ff
I‚Äôve been subscribed for a year
Ridley sure has some  Ff=uN sith the other characters
At 11:33, I legit hi-5ed my screen. Can't leave matpat hanging again!

Well Ridley is a giant, intelligent, pirate, military commander, cyborg, space monster...

Sonic: Im the fastest!
Ridley: Hold my mario.
Tea on James Charles must be spilt
Isabelle is not a shiba. Shes a yorki or some other dog that has chin scruff
Sonics speed is 760 mph
Sonic can run faster than speed of sound.
The real question is..... Is Ridley‚Äôs smash faster than Dr. Eggman running away from sonic? ü§î
so I didn't finish the video but for the weight theres weight values in smash and Ridley is lighter than samosa
557 pounds.... I care about the digits
I am eating so fast because of this guy!!
You should look into the lore of this mobile game called BADLAND. It always confuses me on what it is portraying and what the creatures\machines were and how\why they were made.
This needs to be a fatality in mortal kombat 11
Austin needed to do this
Mat you should make a Chanel seeing if any of the creepypasta's are even real that would be cool
I'd love to have mat as my math or science teacher, this man would make anyone excited for math.
I just saw the end result screen and theres a total launch distance given in meters so i think that might help find a scale for smash
Joker literally shoots his opponents with a glock
5:05 palut e na? um, thats not how u pronounce

"It turns this family friendly game into a gruesome blood bath" -A typical MatPat quote 2019
Wasn't that technically not Ridley's full height, he is hunching over why not use the taunt that makes him stand up straight
would complaing make a game better or just kill of the game?
Well gonna use this tactic on my friends
I might be great at science but I would rather do a color change and precipitate lab than do friction equations. The only thing worse than that is geometry. Screw geometry.
Game Theory: Ridley is the deadliest character in smash

Kirby and Palutena: Allow us to introduce ourselves
Sans and papyrus has to get in smash
I was vs my friend brother he played as ridley and I had to get him to like 300.0% damage and he could knock me out of the map when I was 100.0% damage

Ff=un. Good job matpat. Clap and a half to you.
I said final destination no items faster
am i the only one who actually high fived matpat?
hey matt can you do part two to rosalina's theory
i was gonna make a joke how ridley uses the ground as a cheese grate but you thought of it before me
Ff
 'cause one does not simply leave a fellow geometrician hanging :)
I really hate saying this, especially since I've been a fan of this channel from day one, but I can longer defend it from its detractors when they accuse MatPat of intentionally padding out the run time of his videos for extra ad revenue. Just a few years ago a thoery of this nature would've clocked in around 10-12 minutes, now it's nearly 20.

I don't know if it's a result of the new live action video style, the nearly constant BS that YouTube keeps pulling, or some other factor that I'm not aware of, but whatever the reason Game Theory just isn't any fun to watch anymore.
Love ya matpat not in a weird way....No homo~
can you do a theory on generation zero and see who close we are to have the same thing happnig to us
if mat pat wants a high five, i will break my screen to do it
I was waiting for Austin to come in and say Ridley creates a black hole somehow.
"Why Ridley is Smash's Deadliest Fighter!"




Because he literally stabs people
Called Isabelle a Shiba Inu. She's a Shih Tzu. Downvoted.
Have you noticed Ridley is croutching
Ff (is that it? Idk who cares)
This is not a theory, it is a solid fact. If a 2m space dragon uses you as a skateboard, even if the math is wrong, your neck is gone!




But Isabelle is a shitzu, not a shibaüòë
Ridley is now Thanos, he can make everyone disappear  in seconds.
In what universe is Isabelle a shiba inu?
Hey matt remember delta rune?

I think im on to something can you have a look its the names i have deltarune kris and ralsie in order
And change the words

And i end up with this

Deltarune=undertale
Kris=  risk
Ralsie= is real

Undertale risk is real is it a msg
Sorry if it's off topic, just saying facts and info about random things
Gonna nitpick here Matt, you were far too generous with the normal force being applied. I'm a massage therapist, so I lean my body weight into people every day; from the posture Ridley's using, there's no way he's putting his whole body weight into the move, I'd estimate no more than a quarter of it at the most.

Also, you said asphalt is among the roughest of surfaces, but that the levels use all kinds of materials for the ground, and yet you used the friction coefficient for asphalt to calculate the newtons. This would be fine to calculate the worst case scenario, but I think an average outcome using a more middling friction coefficient would be more accurate.

Fun theory! üëçüèΩ
Yeah,without balancing then there's no way palutena could beat isabelle
To be honest I like the way MatPat is in his theory videos. I hope he does this in all his vids.üòÅ
Matpat why u put game lab on YouTube premium
14:56 Actually, that‚Äôs not Ridley‚Äôs full height. For one of his taunts, Ridley stops slouching and stands completely upright.
EDIT: His height would be over 8 ft.
You don't have to watch the vid ridley is just to big
I gave you a high five! Your good! Ff! ‚úã
Ridley is my favorite character
1:16 and 3:40, truly the most terrifying part of this theory.

15:40 me:fun is games  matpat:EQUASIONS

Correct me. Matpat i think the normal force is the weight of the object (characters that are being pushed on the road) plus the force that is applied to the object (ridley's mass)

wait is that height based on his normal crouch or his stand up straight taunt?
Can we get a F in chatüò•
Wow, it took you 8 minutes to find the frictional force (which btw you forgot to add the weight of the fighter getting scraped to the normal force) to not even use it.
You should have used Ridley's down taunt for a more accurate measuring comparison towards Samus.
Well if u put it like that than it sounds pretty bad but hey I can still beat a ridley main
What about snake? He shoots point blank range with an rpg
I'm pretty sure that it would take a fraction of a second for that person to become little more than a smear if Ridley is truly going that fast...
Naahh it is kirby
I feel like someone already said this but technically Ridley is taller if you use his down taunt
#Americaland
What about the toughness of skin? Kirby might have skin tough enough to withstand that, or the Samus suit might be durable enough, or Pac man, how do we know he isn't as tough as metal?
You do realize the only reason he's going that fast is cause he already had the momentum of the jet right?
force of friction
He protec
He attac 
Most importantly 
He incinerated Mario‚Äôs bac
He is dragging you looooooong ways.
I normally agree with these theories... But you forget that Ridley is NOWHERE NEAR any actual animal/reptile/what have you here on Earth. He is a literal space dragon, which we can't compare to normal Earth standards.

Now, being a D&D nerd (as well as reading up on alternate sources about dragons), I know that even human-sized dragons are ridiculously heavy. Even Dragonborn (basically humans with scales and a thicker skull) stand at around 6 foot and weigh anywhere from 300 to 400 pounds. So, take into account of this being a full-blooded dragon, of a greater natural height, and having additional and possibly denser features (excluding any potential cybernetics - he is a space pirate after all), he'd likely weigh around half a ton, give or take a couple hundred pounds.

Now, the results are still going to be catastrophic, as you've demonstrated, but being the first large official analysis on our favorite pirate dragon, I felt it needed to be given justice.
Ff, fisic is fun
too bad, if I have to murder other characters with ridley, so be it

The only problem I can see with the height that you calculated for Ridley is this, he's not standing straight at all throughout the clips shown. His legs are bent, therefor the height of 7'10 is actually shorter than he really would be.
Ffuuuuuuuuuuuuu
5:05

Ridleys cool and all but Palataina literally traps you inside a black hole like thing and Hits you with a massive lazer beam
Whats hilarious is that he can carry opponents off screen, but If you dont let go at just the right time, Ridley will die first and they can survive.

Nice one, MatPat.
Gore plains nice one
Soooo my main is the deadliest of them all?
Play hollow knight
What happens when you take armor like the metroid suit or items that literally CAN NOT BREAK like the hylean shield. Wouldn't that much friction between a rougher surface, like asphalt, and some magical metal, like the shield, create enough energy to destroy both ridley, link/toon link, the track, the atmosphere, and heck it may be enough to create fission of atoms. So link + ridley= nuke?

To be fair, in Metroid we're seen Ridley physically traverse from planet to planet with nothing but his own two wings on several occasions, hell he even does it in smash during his final smash. He's even seen outspeeding Samus' gunship on several occasions (albeit he usually has a headstart which means he's at least keeping pace with the ship). So the breakneck speeds that we see him moving at here are to be expected. In fact it's probably on the lower end of the speed feats he's got under his belt.
What about Petscop tho
Well that great
but is just a game
Matpat makes a pun Mario hears the pun Mario dies
Wait... what about ridley‚Äôs taunt where he stands up

Edit: to measure its height
Basic fit :So how much you wanna get paid?
Pencils, man.
I'm pretty sure ridely is even taller you can see his full hight with his up taunt
The problem here, Matpat, is that you're assuming that Ridley can even grab any decent player.

My main character is Ridley
Too big for smash

Ridley is top tier confirmed by MatPat's Years of Research! Today's a good day for the smash community.
Ff mat pat Ff...
Anyone who knows the answer to my question I have one why is it that the ultra ball or the purple one no pokemon can escape
Ridley road rash, the triple r. Can this be the actual name for this move?
These videos are so much FUN.
You think that's bad? Try having Bowser hit Pichu with a home run bat while Pichu has 300% damage at 2.0 launch rate. Pichu's speed from getting hit can go up to 8777km/h based on the results screen.
Ff
5:08 Isabelle, according to the ACNL wiki, is a shih tzu! not a shibe!
Ff.
But the height is wrong though. If you do a certain taunt Ridley actually stands up properly, and he‚Äôs huge
Ff=un
I kind of want to know how deadly some other moves in Smash are. What about the stench from Wario's Waft? A sword swing from Ike? What if were flattened by Kirby's Stone or Bowser's Body Slam (side special)? Do Olimar's pikmin actually deal more damage than Smash suggests?

HA You thought Mario couldn't have a cannon height well well well just meet my friend Ridley over here MatPat, but really though i believe that no matter what video game character it is you will always find out their cannon height no matter how long its take and how much Diet Coke you drink.
Ahhh finally a super smash therory! 
On ridley too!!!

anime sonic is faster (speed o sound sonic)

I'm a Ridley main, and this is damn satisfying
Ff
Yes i spam side b for ridley
Do one on ridleys down b
cool make another smash theory
So THIS is the reason why Ridley wasn't is smash before Ultimate.
is it weird i want to main ridley now
Hey remember accounting plus the xylophone made of bones well  in the car chase level when you use the radio and put it on the right station there will be a little secret.
There‚Äôs another way you could have worked out the weight. Look at Ridley‚Äôs flight capabilities compared to his wingspan to determine how much weight his wings are trying to lift up. That would probably make him weigh WAY less than a human because flight using wings can‚Äôt carry all that much weight.
Ff=uN = "Frickin' frick unknown nope"?

Ridley is one of the deadliest fighter's in the game.

Ridley still has to follow the rules, no killing.
Ff
Ff
Doesn't Ridley have a taunt where he stands up straight, making him like twice Samus' height? If so, doesn't that ruin like half the math?
Wow. Good thing science doesn't exist I smash bros. Or any other Nintendo game. Or most other games.
I compared ridley's down taunt to Samus's height and I found out that he is 9 feet tall.
I have found something very interesting, when the game theorists made a video about the duck season game and that the dog was the dad that got me thinking while playing the game, why would the dad kill his son though? Then it has hit me, but I gave up thinking and started watching duck season videos but there was a vid that has caught my perspective, in the Pic of the dad, mom, and the main character buying a new home, inside the windows lie something shocking! So it can't be the dad right!? But remember when the dog was doing gestures about the man character being his father? What if those gestures means something ELSE?
Ff :(
Ff üòÇüòé
Why
Couldn't you have just used the good old universal ruler mario to measure the length of one part of the track and then go a frame ahead and see how much it moved to find it's speed?

Small nitpick: when you say ridleys height, you use his height when he is hunched over. One of his taunts has him stand his full height

Great theory, though I have one minor disagreement, the way you determined Ridley's height, apparently based on his standing animation which is, true to the source, hunched over, as opposed to one of his taunts ( up taunt I believe) which has him standing completely upright. So I believe you may have actually underestimated his height and weight which, granted doesn't change a whole lot. [Shrugs]

scott just made a new video on FNAF
Unless you're dark matter.
anyone else want the old way of editing back?
Mattpat is like that guy who counted how many babies Sonic killed.
You should play tattletail it‚Äôs a pretty cool game and it could be a pretty cool theory if there is enough info on it
Now thats alotta damage

i got road rash last week
Mat pat should do a theory on the flood disease from halo
who else is doing Ff in the comments
Mat, how do you feel about Waluigi not being a playable character in S.S.B.U and is still an assist trophy?
Is that the calculator MatPat will use in his super Mario maker 2 possibilities.
We still need the massahiro sakuri (sorry if I spent his name wrong) named number from the possible combinations theory
Nintendo: creates a new game with "no violent deaths"
Game Theory: wait that's illegal

Kirby wants to know your location..
Why do I like the intro so much???

"Why Ridley is Smash's Deadliest Fighter!"

Samus: Am I a joke to you?
My favorite character is Ridley
Ridley "the most powerful smash fighter my butt. All Kirby has to do is a basic punch, a punch that can smash earth in half. That punch is at the most 10% of his full force. Now for real edumickashon go watch Death battle.
The thing is I high fived matpat

What about Ridley‚Äôs down b
Ff also did you do the taunt that makes him stand up straight
Matpat so Season 9 of fortnite is out in the trailer you can see jonsey(or Craig as NoahsNoah call him) is trapped in a bunker with peels after the volcano erupted after realising there is no food jonsey skins peely and turns him into a banana smoothie so can you work out how long he was trapped in there because he has a long beard when he escaped
and sword fighters can make u lose 90% of ur flesh in a second...
Ff is for forcing you in the pavement

Didnt know that Mortal Kombat went with a Nintendo collaboration.......
Sonic isn't canon in Smash, so he's technically faster than Ridley. In anyways, he is.
mat learn how to say palutena or i will have to diddly darn snap ur neck
Do Game Theory: Viridi is Samus?
Brave of you to say no one is exited to see him.
Who wants another Bendy theory?
Ff 




I'm a science nerd.
he sounded demonic in the conclusion
RIdley is the same size as Waluigi, give or take 2 inches or so.
Matpat needs to make a gaming game show with trivia from the beginning of videogames to modern releases.
Let me get this straight. You're telling us that the fzero stage is the same speed as the games? Nice try no. That would mean Mario would be running at Least 100mph. Just no no no. Inaccurate
What about Riley's  Tont?
Ridley: Watches EndGame/Infinity War
Thanos: Snaps
Ridley: Hold My Beer. [Made From The Wall-E Stuff But With Mario Instead]
but im a ridley main...WELP GUESS IM A MURDERER TOO THEN!
Oh damn Ridley is my favourite character... and I Sometimes or most times use him
Mario grinded into marinara sauce by Ridley.
Matpat T1000 made of diet Coke.
Hey Matpat, Can you do theory on how tall all the characters are in Bendy and the ink machine? I‚Äôm just curious.
THIS IS THE COOLEST EPISODE YET  what with all the green screen and it feels super modern
7:16
"Standared mode"
I actually played Ridley because he was hyped.  I want to try Metroid Prime if it comes to Switch. I played a bit of Super Metroid. I should try it again.
And yet the train from Spirit tracks is apparently way faster than this jet. Also, wouldn't it be physically impossible to exert 100% force downwards via his own weight while still maintaining forward momentum?
I really liked this new format, Matt.
THATS
A LOT OF
theory
NOOOO MATPAT!!! YOU SHOULD OF USED THE TAUNT THAT MAKES HIM STAND TALL
And to think im almost at the end of the year at my school and learning stuff like 2.4+ 2_(btw0 thats a fraction)4 and make it as a mixed number (im not. Jokeing im in 4th grad XD)
Ridley has a taunt where he stands up taller than his normal model.
As a proud ridley main this makes me happy
Ridley! I said ‚Äúa race‚Äù with me, not ‚Äúerase‚Äù with me!
16:03 i thought he was gona say midgets... feelssadman
Smash totally might be the only game to have characters from different franchises fighting against each other cough cough injustice injustice 2 mk9,x and mk11 will soon have some marvel vs capcom 1,2,3,infinite also you made a video on one of the games
Ff in the chat for Mario's face
I can testify to the road rash, yes painful, extremely soo.
I have got an idea on a game you could play or theorize about, the zero escape series.
dude, you had ridley in his idle state, slunched over, do a up taunt and then measure and recalculate that shiz
Nice pic from escape from tarkov terra labs group
do a theory about blixer from just shapes and beats if theres anything to make a theory about
@The Game Theorists
I know it may not seem like it, but in smash ultimate, Ridley does have an official height as sakurai confirmed in Nintendo treehouse, he is 4 meters tall (13 feet). So if he is 13 feet tall then how much of you would he shred?
I'd like a video on why games like the sims are even fun like from a psychological or philosophical point of view cuz I'm addicted and I don't even understand why lol
what about someone with something else on the outside, like samus with her armour?
Do a theory on the mechanics of rocket league and if it is even possible
I guess u could say that he gets...RID of you
Why is this man wearing makeup....relax its just YouTube bro smh
Matt its called doging or parring that attack so sonic is to fest for you
I want to point out that not only is Ridley dragging you under his own weight, but he is also applying force via pressing down onto his opponent as well, which would farther intensify this calculation, I am assuming MatPat left it out due to no source material to determine that applied force, because, how exactly do we determine the amount of force he is applying with 1 hand pressing down?
Please do more episodes on one specific smash character
Don't worry I gave you a high five at 11:38. Canada also can help with that...free healthcare. xD

Waiting for someone else to comment this.
omg stop with the green screen its so cringe >.<
I like that you are actually showing your body and face
Actually it‚Äôs rated e10+
One time during school I was wearing a Game Theory shirt and one kid said "hey a game  theorist shirt!". He immediately started fortnite dancing. I got mixed signals
nice theory. I really like the science episodes!
Love since Ff <3
It's weird seeing you moving.
Who would win Ridley or Kind K Rool
Nerf Ridley
The ending made me smile
You forgot to factor in the fact that Ridley is crouching down quite a bit in his neutral pose. I forget which, but one of his taunts has him standing straight up.
Waluigi would survive.




If he was in Smash.
1:32 
Nintendo: THE JOKES ON YOU THE GAME IS E10+
kirby: gets dragged across big blue and dies
me: Ff
As a Ridley main, I approve of this video. Now I can BM my opponents even harder by telling them that realistically, they just died.
Could you use your other mic more often instead of the mic you use for the projection of yourself I just want it because it sounds better
everything was going smoothly until a very critical part:


you made the test on F-Zero GX's Big Blue instead of F-Zero X's Big Blue, which the smash stage is actually based on.
I mean did yall forget about how ridely literally stabs you and you explode
You should do a theory on world of goo
loved the vid but isabelle isashitzu
prefered the old matpat
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas ridly #1
Mach 1 around
So... Matpat... Have u realized that the "utopia" of fortnite is selling the banana skin as food?




This could be a dark theory for your next video!

Btw if you see this comment please I want to appear in the video :3
Please please please tell people about the remixer with my simble please please tell

Ff I‚Äôve got ya MatPat
You didn't consider his taunt. The taunt makes him stand up at least 50% taller.
rated E for Edge
Shouldn't PSI come into play? Maybe, translate Newtons into lbs of pressure, then calculate surface area?
Space balls reference!
using the ticks in training mode you can calculate it. each tick equals.5 (Yes I used Mario to calculate it) roughly 10-11 ft is what I found but my numbers were lost but I can confirm I used rulers to calculate it almost perfectly for anyone.
14:55
NOOOO MatPat !! Do a taunt with Ridley ! He's actually taller ! maybe 1.5x more than Samus
2.57 was that 11 spinal tap reference?
This is my first video of yours. Found you from your support of that whole Twitter nightmare. You got a subscriber and an 'up top' from your science crowd
Whenever I'm having a bad day, I have to blame it on space dragon pirates, because let's face it, it's ALWAYS their fault.
When u realise he didnt taunt to get his full height (maybe he did idk)
Umm... you didn't use the Ridley stretching out Taunt for his whole height...
But... Kirby doesn't have two feet of flesh. He's only eight inches tall!
THAT'S A LOTTA DA MIDGE
i allways liked ridley but i dint know he is that strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What about when Ridley uses his standing straight up taunt?
Mat pat you should make a theory ,if it was possible for Craig(Tfue skin) was able to survive so many year just from the banana man in season 9 of Fortnite
Wait, isn't this just that one Mario Kart episode, again?


Goddamnit, Game Theory.

Shadow Frax used the quote ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a theory...‚Äù I immediately said ‚ÄúA Game Theory.‚Äù
So ridley's forward b is like that one kabal fatality in mortal kombat 11
Ganondorf would crush Ridley.
So....  To sum this up, Ridley can turn "Big Blue" into "Big Red Stain" in one move.
I‚Äôm learning about the fun formula in Physics in school when this video was uploaded. Coincidence? Probably.
Hi can you do more Petscop the 21st came out like a week ago
That A LOT of damage
8:02 Deja vu
I'm a science nerd
You forgot Ridley is at max height during a down taunt 

( like so matpat will see)

Edit:Ff
There is a problem with using the Mario kart calculations, they assumed that you would stop after a period of time, but Ridley is constantly accelerating to match the speed lost by friction. You shouldn‚Äôt be looking for total lost skin you should be looking for post skin per second.
this is why i always play ridley and Kirby
I can‚Äôt play ridley again
I HATE HOW MATPAT IS LIVE AND MOVING I HATE IT SO MUCH BRING BACK THE OLD EDITING PLZZZZZZZ OTHERWISE I WONT BE ABLE TO WHATCH YOU ANYMORE WITCH IS A SHAME CUZ I LOVE YOUE VIDS

Mat pat: uses cm, m and km
Australians: cries tears of joy and says ur one of us now
Ridly has always been violent just look how he does a similar move on Samus in Brawl. Just a question Game Theorists how tough is Samus‚Äô armour? How tough is Bowsers shell?
Hopefully MatPat can answer that question.

08:05 I think that was.....Because yes.

Is no one just gonna talk about how 999.9% is impossible? No like actually the max damage counter is 999.0%. I know it's weird but it's true
Triggered when Mat Pat says that Isabelle is a Shiba Inu.. When clearly it's confirm she's a Shitzu...

Me: Plays Megaman and ROB* lol go robots
Game theory: Ridley is the most dangerous Kirby

Kirby: am I a joke to you
Ridley is my favorite fighter. + Nintendo villain
if this video was sponsored by Nord VPN then he could say at the end "Just imagine how fast your WiFi could move with nord VPN!"

just paying by respects
What if the next theory was about Danganronpa?
Hey Matt, do you think you could do a video on Hollow Knight? It's a (relatively) little-known indie game with a fascinating lore behind it (and beautiful visuals as well). It also has by far one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard from any game.
purple guy is not springtrap he's thanos.
Would someone like Bowser or Samus be okay though, since they have armor or a shell that is thicker than skin?
yea well he also kills parents
When I do it Ridley just stops after like 3 seconds when he drags them across the track of big blue. He doesn't consistently drag them!
But have you ever been spiked by a Ganondorf down-air?
MatPat: Calls Bowser slow 14:42
Me: Have you seen my boy run??
MATPAT: Ridley is Smash‚Äôs most deadly character 



Kirby: laughs
Theory Idea:
Maybe you could take the percentage of damage done by this attack and calculate how durable all the Smash characters are?
19:45, oh well, guess I'll have to send over a clone batch of Matpat, AGAIN. Because for some reason he just can't help losing himself on the internet.

seven grade science but yet i feel dumb from hearing it from matpat
If Mario becomes shorter every time Ridley uses the attack, now what would be Mario's true height?
we may never know
or will we?
btw Ff
He needs to get a buff so he does that much damage. Although that would make the game unfair.
Yes you are right my friend
ridley actually does fly at or above the speed of sound in his own games
you need to account for durability, some fighters have taken meteors to the face an taken no dmg in their canon material, if my hand was more durable than the asphalt road of the track, I wouldn't be rubbed away, I would rub away the track.

You didn‚Äôt use Ridleys ‚Äòstand up‚Äô taunt to accurately get his real hight, he woulda been taller.

Btw I was pressing on my screen when you were saying 'up top'.
You're not alone.
Hi five and I like Science like here if you like science
I'll be honest. I don't like having MatPat in front of a green screen. I prefer just animations the whole time. Just my personal opinion.

Ridley is massively faster then light, but ok.
999% damage in one move? So every one of king k rool‚Äôs attacks?

will matpat i did
Another theory you could try to do with smash ultimate is how can characters like bowser and mario for example escape the black hole item?
Ridley's gonna break your neko neko knees
Why is he deadliest Fighter? Because he
A) Murdered Samus' parents
B) Impaled a laser-shooting robot boy with the psychology of a ten year old using only his tailtip
C) Broke the neck of a famous mascot with his bare hands 
D) Is a massive purple dragon/alien/pterodactyl thing with a knife tail.
Isabelle is a Shih Tzu not a Shiba Inu
Dose that asthvalt have a YouTube channel, they was the best part of the video!
Ridley wouldn't be that heavy or there would be some serious problems flying. Unlike an alligator, which is used, Ridley probably has less weight. Those wings so wouldn't be able to fly otherwise :P Reality wise Ridley would have bones like birds.
Hey mat you do know how to taunt right?
9:35 I don't want to have air ride through my lungs anymore.
Hmmm... What about the little god we call kirby.   _.
This is all of my opinion, but I kinda liked it when Mat wasn't in IRL mode on some of his videos. Don't take it personally though, if you like it keep doing what your doing dawg! DONT TAKE THIS EFFENCIVELY!!!!!!!!!! 
(and yes I know some opinions may be effective to other peps please don't be mad and eventually sue me.)
This show has really gone downhill. Where are the real theories?
Why is it that when ever I learn something new in school, Matpat always talks about how it works in his most recent video.
good thing i'm a ridly main
looks at intro

Say sir how much would you charge for that game?
5:09 Isabelle is a Shih Tzu, not a Shiba Inu. I am deeply offended by this obscure and insignificant mistake. (Great Video)
Ridley: *drags everyone across the stage
Big Blue: aM I a jOke tO yOu?
oh crap my brother loves Ridley and that's his main...
so im screwed?
This isn‚Äôt Ff=√ªN anymore
What about ridleys down b with metal face and deep breathing spirts
When I saw the thumb nail I thought he was talking about down b
Follow up theory idea: are there any metals that Samus' suit or MegaMan could be made of that would allow them to survive this?
Isabelle's fishing rod throws you at 600 miles per hour because of leverage and stuff. V-sauce did a thing about it.

Next Theory: Why King Dedede is pure perfection

Every big character is brutal as heck: Bowser's side B seems brutal, Ganondorf's  neutral B is literal dark matter, and the others just deal tins of damage
But MatPat the characters in super smash bros are much much stronger than normal people, unless if your saying how dangerous ridley`s attack to humans are
I wonder how well Samus's armor would handle this

You should get on that.
Lol nintendo gonna get sued
Still not used to weatherman MatPat
hes mad
Did you here about the guy who got his left side dragged on the ground by Ridley?

He‚Äôs all right now.
He didnt use ridley's height for standing straight up
Make a theory on titanfall 2's ending with the helmet fleshing
I already knew that move was brutal seeing him just snatch me out of the air and drag my face across the ground, Broly style
I knew I picked the right main from the very beginning
It is clear that PICHU is the strongest since he is a GOD
just saying mat pat ridley is not standing up in the pic you're using so that's not his height he's taller
I miss the funny faces
he said joker doesnt matter im made
Hey MatPat, you were only using characters that were just flesh...what about the ones with armor?
Who would win? 
A scary dragon who can kill a bounty hunter parents?
Or 
One freeze boi
Makes sense why its a kill option in 5mash
game creators: look at this kid friendly game!
matpat: my eyes! Why is there so much gore?
Ridley:I‚Äôm faster than the speed of light


Flash:am I joke to you * zoom *
Yess i love space balls thank you so much for bringing that scene up
They should've changed the intro to have a Ridley sprite close in on Mario while he's running

It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs not trying anymore; the lackluster ‚Äútheory‚Äù,  the obviously incorrect #s, the buildup to an equation that had literally nothing to do with the conclusion. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the lack of unique detailed editing this show used to have before matpat started doing live action speaking.
I kinda want a "Physics of Mortal Kombat Fatalities" video. I really need to know how hard Geras has to be pushing to push someones face off.

Does Ridleys taunt height not count ?
Well you see, Sonic has this move.. where he rolls into a ball. He goes fast enough when you do. I did it all the time.
spaceballs reference in the video!
*thank you matpat,
very cool.*
E for everyone rating was already ruined when they added Bayonetta
I play as ridley all day and i defeated my friends every time i play super smash brothers. I beated everyone in my school and i said that im the champion of super smash bros ultimate.
Yay, fire breathing flesh tearing robot dragons! From space!
The way I see it, 
the fact that your character isn't erased when Ridley uses that attack means that something else is at work.
Three words:
Ridley's size is fairly consistent in the 3d games. Always around 3-4 times the height of Samus.
I am already a Ridley main
That 1mm of character/person scraped off by asphalt for each 1mph above 30mph assumes that the body is skidding across the ground and slowing down to a complete stop after being thrown from a moving vehicle. Ridley doesn't look like he's slowing down, so the 7.5 ft of flesh scraped away that was calculated here doesn't fully show the potential damage his move would do, for that you'd have to account for how long he's dragging his opponent.

Not that it really matters in the end, they dead either way. Just putting that out there in case this hasn't been overanalyzed enough already.
As a ridley main I have a new respect for him now
Wouldn't Ridley be a little taller then what mat pat calculated sence Ridley I kind of crouching
It wasn't standing though though shouldn't it be taller
Matpat, you measured Ridley's height while hunched over. That's not how tall he is from foot to head. You measured Samus and Ridley by two different standards. Shame on you.
One time I fell and skid/slid across concrete on my face it was bad and I was running
So kind of like Kabal‚Äôs fatality in MK11
Can we get an Ff in chat for our fallen MatPat
Ofc the giant fire breathing dragon is deadlier than Mario and friends
I gave you a high five
Cats don't have 9 lives! They have 1 life!!!!
hey Matpat I have an idea for a new theory channel. It't book theory you theorize on books instead of movies and games.
Wait, what about Mecha Ridley? All that metal has GOTTA add some weight, right?

Broly:Hold my KAKAROT!!
Hey MatPat, are you gonna get to Part 2 of that Kirby Theory video you did a Month ago?
Did anyone else notice that he SNAPPED, and then later said the words OUT OF EXISTENCE. Coincidence? I think not.
I'm a Ridley main.
I clicked because my mans was in the thumbnail.
Aw man you should have said 'More powerful than Ganon"
cause  ya know he has the Triforce of Power
Ridley; 'bows left to right'  'flaps into the air'  You are lucky i'm merciful...
I thought that was barney the purple dinosaur!
Lets be honest, you dont need to prove it with science, that ridley's side special kills everything.
Oil
FBI OPEN UP
I already knew ridley was the most legit brutal of the recurring nintendo villains. Nice theory matt. Though as someone pointed out, he actually does have a taunt where he stands up to full height, and know what? It doesn't even matter. Even when slouched he's annihilating you no matter what.
I like your videos without you being in them.
Keep these up MatPat! I am really enjoying the new format to Game Theory.  You have great presence with the live-action segments, and the animation, humour and absurdity continue to increase in quality.  I believe you're just  starting to hit your stride and know you will continue to inspire and educate for many more years in the future.  Thanks!

Don't these calculations only work if you assume everyone is made out of the same flesh? And that all cannon universes share that all creatures have the same durability as another? What I mean is that only the most human characters would be applicable to this setup.
Well..... Don't underestimate a freaking Dinosaur just because some stupid game developers don't know how deadly one can be.
But Ridley is my favorite character
This is assuming that the entire body is made of skin. You would also have to adjust for bone density. Bones will grind down a lot slower than skin.

Personally I've always felt Ridley's one of the most misunderstood characters of the Nintendo universe. Ever since the 80's as a teenager playing the original Metroid game I've have a profound interest in him that's only grew over time. I find it shameful how in official literature written about him his shown as an extremely intelligent, well spoken, and a leader of an elite fighting force, but also someone who loves to play mind games to win his fights (who wouldn't?) While in the games he's just seen as a mindless roaring psychotic monster... 

Likewise for his acts of violence it question should be asked as to what right do humans have mining on his world, what happened to the rest of his kind, and did humans have a hand in this? It is clearly written in one short comic all be it so called non-canon (these things change often and it depends on who you ask) that Samus meets another of the same species as Ridley named Greed and he swiftly says humans were to blame for (whom doesn't know Ridley was alive) the death of Ridley whom was greatly respected and beloved among his kind and that humans were directly responsible for killing off every single one of his species, himself being the last! If even a small sample of this is taken into account it's very easy to see why Ridley has done not for gain but revenge! Revenge for making his kind suffer and revenge for him living a life alone! So why should he be expected to care about another species, a species that's completely weak without its technology, and a species that doesn't care one little bit about what it does to all other species, including its youth!

So yes, I am and will continue to defend Ridley. As in some ways I decently see similarities of his plight and that of my ancestors who were almost wiped from the face of the earth by invaders who wanted our resources. Could this also be why Ridley become the way he is? I certainly believe so! Likewise I'll be honest and say I find Ridley attractive, especially in his current forum. To me he's a masculine beauty and someone I'd definitely love to get to know and understand if he'd accept and appreciate I was a allie to him! Who the hell knows, he could be homosexual. Traditional pirates were very accepting of it after all! In the end it should always be remembered, one has tried to kill every single one of a species and blown up entire planets (like that'd never cause huge unfixable consequences) and it wasn't Ridley!
Ff
if it was Real life all of them will destroy the planet and some of them wont have scratch

Math nitpick: Matt, I know it kinda ruins your "fun" acronym, but Œº is pronounced "mu." It's a lowercase mu to be exact, making the all caps abbreviation "FMU" for the equation. How can you call yourself a math nerd then go and forget your Greek lettered variables? XD

All in all though, enjoyed the theory, still getting used to the new green screen presentation, looking forward to the next game/film theories!

Yo matpat you should make a theory on Enter the gungeon! It has a lot of interesting lore you could dive into.
Wouldn‚Äôt using his down taunt (the one where he stands at full size) be more accurate after all he his super hunched over to help the size of his model I don‚Äôt think it would change it very much (if anything it will make it more lethal) anyway I was just wondering

Not every game pulls these kinds of tricks. Sekiro certainly doesn't.

Why ask for an EASY MODE from a game company that is known for making HARD TO BEAT games? Like WTF?
In Undertale, when you do the photoshop Flowey fight, once you get the help of the other souls you don't take damage during his attacks. 
You can die when the attacks are his black and white and you have the chance to heal, but the bombs, the vines, the bugs, and all the flashy lights, are just there to distract you from the fact your health isn't getting any lower.

And if you die repeatedly while playing Injustice Gods Among Us, the difficulty level lowers down for the current fight.
Is the health bar 10% full or 90% empty?
Well I‚Äôm going to flex with my blue shield on god of war
You‚Äôre not as good as games that you think you are...

16:33 this statement alone made me never want to play this game again.
DDA doesn't feel like it was in kh3 critical mode but I guess I'll keep dying to see if they change anything now that I know this mechanic exist
I never pick easy mode,  but I agree there should be one, not everyone likes to finish a game the hard, suffering way
You forgot that Epic games give Ninja extra damage or else he bans players for stream sniping.

I think DDA should be an option, along with traditional difficulty settings.
DDA is present in Dark souls 2, might be also in every installment of the Souls series.
I like this green screen editing, I was getting kind of sick of that one pic of MatPat with a lanyard.

Hornet: Am I  a joke to you?
But Crash Bandicoot very clearly made it easier after multiple failures. I.e the Aku aku. It wasn't very secretive
Sekiro and the Soulsborne games do get easier every time you die. It‚Äôs called LEARNING!!
But the argument in the middle still stands: Even with automatic adjustments the game still keeps within the range of the chosen difficulty setting. Adjusted Normal Mode is still harder than unadjusted easy mode and usually only the features the player struggles with get adjusted just enough for the player to barely make it. If a player struggles with a single feature of a game it's a good idea to help them with it. 
From Software games fall into a specific category of hardcore games though. These games are designed to be as accurate as possible and offer the player not an "easy way out" by adjusting the enemies but they offer other paths with different types of enemies and a growth system to strengthen the player (Level Up in Soulsborne, Prayer Beads and Memories in Sekiro) and Sekiro even offers a lot of countermeasures for bosses since you can't just summon help.
All those games are on "easy" difficulty from beginning anyway. Calamity Ring and Bell Demon are the hard modes you can switch on if you are feeling extra masochistic
I actually play all my games on the hardest difficulty, I die a lot in some of them and I'm not great at them, I just enjoy the pain
This actually makes me want to play games more tbh
"You're not as good at games as you think you are" is theorist for "git gud". This has been your weekly Theorist translation.

Matpat:your just not as good at games as you think you are
Me: how dare you insult me with the truth
It's already well known that in the Dark souls games that leveling up  is a pretty easy way to get past the difficulty, or using magic instead of melee, or using crystal weapons to get a damage buff for a short period of time, or any of the other ways to make the game easier for you.

Hollow knight is a great example of a game with a player set difficulty that isn't as badly implemented as a easy/medium/hard setting. I forgot what they're called but there are the badges that you can collect that give you better jump, better dash, more range, stronger attacks, more health, better dodge, literally any way you wanted to make the game easier and they were hidden in plain sight, in the middle of all the other badges that you fundamentally needed to progress in the game. This is the way that difficulty should be done. It's a shame that more game devs don't do it like this. I've always hated dying at a spot 2 or 3 times and the game comes up with a condescending, "hey there buddy you need some help?" To me, that's even worse than doom calling you a big baby for playing it on easy.
I've played so many games, especially shooters. And many times I got killed and come right back with pure adrenaline rush killing more players than I did when the match started. It's a good thing they do this as nobody is going to be untouchable.

Then there are games like Shenmue on Dreamcast (kind of a darling game, bit of a cult classic, it's development cost tanked Sega, and took 17 years to get the story continued), one segment you are trying to break into an old warehouse to meet with someone. If you keep getting caught, eventually you get a map of the patrol routes of the guards, if you still can't get it, the game starts you off later at night (11pm vs 8pm) when there are fewer guards. 

Also I am sure it gets more relaxed if you keep failing the QTE sequences....and the 70 man fight.
"You're not as good at games as you think you are."
Wait...
B-but wait- I already think I'm pretty terrible.
Oh. Oh no!
Oh god please no!!!
Playing any game on easy mode is basically just like watching an interactive movie
I beat Sekiro and it's really cool, except how it handles difficulty. I wish instead of just giving enemies more health and attack. DmC 5 does the same thing except also modifies enemy placements and increases enemy AI, with also making it so you'll likely only have unlocked half of the available moves in the first playthrough, making each playthrough on a higher difficulty feel fresh.

Shadow of War also does something cool, as if you die to an enemy they get stronger.
Easy mode should be an option because if it is too difficult it gets more frustrating than fun, also it's not fair because it limits the story for those who just can't do as well.
The main controversy sounds like the same argument when it comes to shows. You know, ‚ÄúWho are you to judge the decisions a director makes. It‚Äôs their show, and they can do what they want.‚Äù
This is why I just play Stardew Valley and Slime Rancher
most games don't have these things, or have them disabled on harder difficulties. The ones that don't follow these rules are far and few between. 

Street fighter for example has it. If you destroy the ai in round 1, round 2, the ai is much hard harder, on the flip side, if you lose in round 1, the ai could be idle at some moments in round 2. It doesn't feel good to see it get easier.

The low hp thing on the HUD is a great idea that doesn't change difficulty. That's pretty cool info. shame it doesn't appear is hard modes.
Excuse me just asking here but if I beat the game without upgrading anything isnt that beating the game? Well except for the disappearing people lol.
I really like to play smash on a normal to hard mode so I can get better at online so I can learn combos and feel the pin point movements  on hits so I can learn the game
I've beaten Dark Souls 2 and 3 and Bloodborne and the only thing that makes those games hard is the massive hit boxes that and lag/player invasions but those are more annoying then anything.
Matpat is officially the best gamer in the whole world. He was actually able to play through superman 64 not once, but 3 times... increasing in difficulty. o-o
Like Dark Souls, Sekiro will always be challenging as a general rule; and like Dark Souls, depending on how you play Sekiro, will make the game exponentially less or more challenging.
Then there‚Äôs minecraft and tf2 in the corner
Both with a decade under their belts and none of this nonsense
I'm a little late to this party, but I've played games in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. I've most certainly haven't been playing easy mode for most of my life. People complaining now have no idea what hard really looks like.
I forgot what game it was where I noticed this auto adjustment, and it made me so mad that it OBVIOUSLY tweaked the diffuculty. I was so insulted I never finished playing the game, because I wanted to keep trying till I got through it. should these type of mechanics be an option?
Excuse me, I have beaten Matt in Wii Sports boxing. I am peak gamer performance.
To be fair, most games have both fake difficulty (enemies miss their first shots) and fake difficulty (enemies can shoot and see through walls, but of course you can't).
I say always have an easy mode, but the harder the difficulty the more rewarding such as maybe easy ends with you beating a certain boss and game over your done, but on hard that boss is scripted to kill you and then you have a new experience with vastly different results and feelings, or maybe an important character that the game has made you care about dies on easy because you weren't strong enough for hard
Minecraft didn't have this thing...
No Compromise, no difficulty adjustments for me please.
MatPat: You're just not as good at games as you think you are.
Me: MatPat, you greatly underestimate my own underestimations.

the dynamic difficulty in mortal kombat really pissed me off, id lose to someone so many times that they would start just randomly attacking nothing and letting me win which made me even more mad than losing so many times, it felt shitty that i sucked so much the game itslelf would just let me win so I would restart the whole game every time i lost just to reset the difficulty, like it completely ruined the experience of winning because it just let me win
Fortnite:
Pros only deal 4 damage with the tactical shotgun
another example for DDA? Pokemon Yellow, you had a pikachu at the beginning and your rival had an eevee, if on 2 battles, you won 2, the rival's eevee would evolve in a jolteon,the hardest to fight with a pikachu, if you won 1, he would evolve in a flareon, neither hard or easy, if you won 0, he would evolve on a vaporeon, the easiest eeveelution to fight with a pikachu

Hey Matt ! 
There are some new petscop videos please make another video on petscop!
11:52 AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE
Personally, I don't think either it better than the other. They're just different methods of allowing the player to experience the game, with the skill and experience they have. If anything the difficulty settings are learning tools to help you get through the game, and what changes is how up front they are about it.


If I can compare the difficulty settings to teachers in a school, the adjusting difficulty it the teacher that goes to you to help you with a subject you're struggling with, while the choice a setting is the teacher that waits for you to come to them. Neither is inherently bad. The teacher that reaches out to you is saving you the embarrassment of admitting you need help (which our society frowns upon for some dumb reason). While the the teacher that waits for you to go to them is letting you make the decision yourself and not trying to push you.


Adjusting difficulty is allowing the player to have a little more breathing room to learn the finer points of the game that they're struggling with, whilst keeping the game's flow. While the difficulty setting choice let's the player decide if they want to grit their teeth and bear with the struggle, or dial it back so they can get a little more practice.
Game Theory? Pft, more like Game Journalism
Boy, I sure wish dynamic difficulty adjustment applied to school tests like the SAT.
Player: Dies too many times
Game: lemme fix that for ya homie
Haven't watch GT in probably two years.  Dang that is a higher budget
So games self adjust like the GMAT, the CPA Exam, and almost any other computerized standardized test.. sounds about right... continue....

...Background ü§î Reference to Markiplier‚Äôs Damien??? üò±üòÇ
The fact of the matter is that dynamic difficulty wouldn't really work in a FromSoft game, they're based around pattern recognition, memorization, and refinement of basic skills. Having the game adjust things like enemy numbers and boss health would rob the game of that. It's not the sort of title you're supposed to play through without dying, in fact you're intended to die quite often, but eventually learn from your mistakes to come back and beat what stopped you last time. Easy modes would also rob the player of this, since again they make it so that the player is less likely to experience the satisfaction of memorizing a boss' moves and using their knowledge to overcome it. Easy modes would essentially turn these games' boss fights into a five second long simulator of bashing a glorified walk cycle, since the bosses have long idle periods between their attacks to allow the player to get damage. If the player isn't required to take these attacks seriously because they have absurd amounts of damage resistance thanks to playing on easy, then the boss fights turn from being a pulse pounding exchange into being a joke.
Also, all of these games have an extremely dark tone, and slaughtering everything on some kind of easy mode doesn't mesh with that.


Although, the games FromSoft makes tend to have easier options hidden in the game mechanics, such as magic in the dark souls series making the game far easier thanks to most enemies being melee focused and having pathing constraints. Since the games revel in having the player figure things out for themselves, this structure of difficulty adjustment seems the most well suited this type of game.




As a sidenote, having an easy/medium/hard difficulty that you select is in general bad difficulty design. Having someone select a difficulty at the start of the game makes no sense because at that point the player doesn't know what easy or hard really mean in the context of that game, so players essentially have to rely entirely on their own bias and conditioning to determine their experience with the combat encounters of the game. Difficulty settings that you can adjust on the fly are better, but not by much, since most players when encountering an obstacle will either be too frustrated or too prideful to use them, not to mention changing the difficulty in that situation never feels good for the player.
is there a database of games with this sort of stuff so we can know what games to not buy?
When I first played Dark Souls, I was a massive noob for like 2 months of trying to figure out where to go next and how not to die to everyhting. Eventually, through trial and error, experimentation and practice, I figured out how the game wanted me to play, and I beat it. It's not like only 1% of players can beat Dark Souls. People beat Dark Souls all the time, so maybe it's really YOUR problem. Maybe you're too used to pressing "R" and use your ultimate to kill everything without effort. Maybe you're too stuck in the mindset of generic AAA action games that can't go 5 seconds without holding your hand.

Maybe you just need to git gud.
PS: Just because some games have dynamic difficulty mechanisms, doesn't mean that every game does. The last thing we need is a Cult of Dynamic Difficulty going around telling everybody how all their gaming experiences and skills are a lie because dYnAmIc DiFfiCuLtY.

i knew it games have a secret easy way not mode because its not you choice but yha in fallout games after i die a bunch of times some enimes despawn or dont group up as much alwoing easier stealth kills
Other games: "Let's adjust difficulty to match the players skill or lack thereof."
Arma: "Let the AI at random go from braindead training target to aimbot instantkill and be done with it."
Talks about Easy mode
Matpat: I"M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT!
MatPat: you just not as good at games as you think you are!

Me: hold my controller
Only one I hate is hidden dynamic difficulty. 
Obfuscating stuff for a better game feel is perfectly fine per se, when it's consistent. 
But when I find out that the game went easy on me because I wasn't doing well when I never asked for it makes me feel cheated.

It's like if someone tells you a year later that they let you win.

huh, so that is why that guy poped up/off for no reason. I'm glad I don't play much of those game, I will notice everything and then get annoyed I can't relay on the game because it changes all the time. Also I feel it just takes away the whole idea of learning. You learn nothing if the game just adjust so you don't have to learn anything.


I see it's good use, however I say leave it to the developers how they want to make their games. If you don't like the game then don't play it or make a better one yourself. I say you are disrespectful, spoiled, and a jerk for go on about how developers should do their job. Sure you can have your own opinion, but there is different between having an opinion and force your opinion on others. You can think all you want in the little head of yours but don't tell others they have to follow your way of thinking.


If you want others to know your opinion you can tell it to them as your opinion aka. "in my opinion,  go kill yourself!!!!" (the "go kill yourself" is just a "bonus" lots of people like to use. It is still bad without it.

The Crash Bandicoot DDA is obvious - but honestly by the time I realized it was happening I was so frustrated with falling off that gosh dang bridge every time that I didn't care that I had extra checkpoints. Just wanted to get through it and get back to the game. So I think it's okay. Otherwise I might never have finished it.
basically, if you have easy mode, you destroy the game overall. the happiness on dark souls is fight hard to win, not oneshot every boss

Unless you ring the demon bell Sekiro starts off on easy mode. Jokes on all the people complaining.

Does From software use DDA? Your point kind of falls flat if it doesn‚Äôt. I can see people being fine with this system in several games types of games. From Softwares games sell on their honesty though. No invisible walls, if an enemy can (including bosses) can be seen it can be killed, miracle builds getting weaker across the DS series is actually a story implementation and so on... 

As a matter of fact deamon souls had the exact opposite of DDA. If you died a lot the game would get more and more difficult. Something called ‚Äúworld state‚Äù unless I‚Äôm mistaken. 

DDA is certainly prominent in games, but without proof of it being used in the game that started the controversy the discussion becomes redundant. The point boils down to ‚Äúall games are easier then they seem‚Äù, which does not appear to be the case.

I'm glad that Matpat covered this. I always figured this was an obvious thing game developers did, but I've talked to people and it seems most people don't realize that dynamic difficulty adjustment is a thing! It's great to see someone tackling this topic :)
Hey Mattpat! Awesome job with that theory!

Now I hope I don't go too off topic here but there is one theory you could add with the Splatoon selection which has been going on for a while now. The screams... Nobody has been able to figure out where they've been coming from or where the location the scream is taking place.

Games like Minecraft don‚Äôt pull these tricks. Right!
Fortnite has something called "bloom" witch makes you miss your shots even if the cross hair is directly on the other player....
Posting before watching. 
Friends have shown me some games that get over this by relating to real world people and renaming the modes. 
Easy - You work and have a family mode. 
Normal - You can spare a few hours to play
Hard - You want to play this game how we (devs) imagine it to be played
Legendary - OMG R U Kidding me.  Okay we warned you and you asked for it. 
Also known as survival / completionist / ....
"we've gained nothing"? are you sure? have we not gained maybe an interesting story, maybe wisdom or atleast emotions? Some fun? That's what games are made for. But I can't have fun with a game if I can never progress in it. I'm not angry about DDA and Easy mode. They make games accessible to me. I'm somewhat disabled (hands don't move as quickly as/to the extend they should) and I know Easy mode is not the solution for every disabled gamer but it is for me. I'd love to play Sekiro but I also know without an Easy mode I have no possibility to pass even the first boss (maybe even the first wave of enemies) without someone else playing it for me. With every huge Quick Time Event-/ Hard mode-/ whatever is next- Trend in the gaming industy I feel like missing out on great experiences and potentially wasting A LOT of money on games that turn out to be unplayable for me.
So basically almost every D&D DMs secret
Wow I got away for two months and everything I loved about this channel is just gone where is the old 2d matpat
That would explain getting one pumped by defaults
The argument makes sense but, I stand out when compared to other players (for positive reasons)

MatPat:You're just not as good at games as you think you are

Me: I already know MatPat, I already know....
Hey did you not know that I'm a kid watching your vids at night that likes them and plays bendy and the ink machine and everthing
I noticed when I would play the Halo games that despite me dieing even on easy when I played in hard or insanity I could still get through levels.
0:55 - "It's true! It's a fact! It's a faaaact!"

But hey, that's just a theory...
Ill be waiting on that fortnite video. I love a good controversy. Subbed.
MatPat: "You're not as good at games as you think you are"
Don't worry, I already know I suck.
Are you going to do Another Mega man Maker Live stream? I am asking Because i am working on A Level that is complex, and that you might Enjoy. 


So if you are, You will make me Very happy, and excited
Personally i dont buy games like the souls series because i value my controllers as much as i want to try them
Now dear Mr. Matt Patt? 2ts or 1t oh well frigg it.
Well I'm long viewer almost NEVER AGREE WITH YOU.....
Butt on this topic im standing right behind you
There are games that let you turn dynamic difficulty on or off, that's the proper approach for me.
mat MY GOD you are insane this year in these vids lol.
Friend: I got 10 kills in Fortnite, I am a pro

Me:
Hey matpat I have a Theory for you what if breath of the Wild is a unification of the three timelines that have split into one through the Mandela effect.
I used to think games needed difficulty settings, then I played Demon‚Äôs Souls and had to GIT GUD
A mobile game I‚Äôm currently playing has the opposite mechanism though.
The first time you play a stage it will be easier than usual.
But weather you succeed in clearing that stage or not,
the next time it will get harder and even harder if you repeatedly play the same stage.
It will be reset back to normal if you re-login though.
When you realize that DDA doesn‚Äôt affect rhythm games... like
I miss the good old days of 2D MatPat
Sekiro has Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment as well. You lose half gold and XP and maybe get Dragon Rot upon death. It's making it more difficult. That's dynamic :v
MatPat: *You're not good in games as you think you are*

Me: Expert Revengeance Death Defiled Masochist Hardcore Fun Mode Terraria.
"You've probably been playing on easy mode for your entire life." 
No, I've only played half of my life on easy mode; the rest has been on masochistic difficulty.
Hey this reminded me of the quote from wreck it Ralph:Ralph wrecks the internet.
12:06 "perfectly balanced, as all things should be..."
Does Sekiro has dynamic difficulty? After dying 1000 times against Demon of Hatred...I don't think so
I don't think Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment should be a thing, but I think there should at least be an easy mode option. In the end, it is the player's choice, and the player's fault.
I swear to god if he starts mentioning the Dunning-Kruger Effect, I'm gonna lose it.
I am flat out dog crap at games
Alternate title for the video:

"You're not as good at video games as you think you are."
Ah, splendid. I was under the impression that my level of proficiency with "the video game" was such as to be called bottom-rung. With that being the case, and with there being nowhere to go but up...
See you at EVO, I suppose?
Nobody:
Is it just me or does Kratos in the thumbnail look like The Completionist?
... No one? No? O.K. then.
Finally MatPat shows us a video from Matt & Pat...
Too bad Best Friends Play had to die for that.
PETSCOP, PLEAeSE

A WHOLE BUTT-TON JUST GOT RELEASED.
Now make a Austin theory. Liked your video btw
Petscop is back 21 episodes in total now. Please make a new petscop theory
If people cant farm enough to make the game easy then they dont know how to make a difficult game EZ
Matpat:You are not as good at games as you think.
People who did dark souls no hit challenge:sadness
2:27 the con list got a good laugh, 10/10 jokeüòÇ
Is this drama Twitter only?
Pls do another tboi theory. I get it's all ready panned out what's going on but I have a feeling that there is something more
The Division 2 definitely gives invulnerability frames when near death in PVE
I feel like this is the secret origin of Jirard syndrome. 
Me: i almost made it. But I got the timing down perfect one more shot
Game: Dont worry fam we heard you died so we slowed everything down by just enough to make you completely miss the platform next time
*Death spiral ensues
Fun fact is that the actual version of Sekiro is way easier than the one played by the streamers and youtubers some weeks/months before release, as From Software greatly increased the time you had to input the parry in order to deflect ennemy attacks.
The version played by the streamers required a lot more precision than what we have now.
The awnser is one as old as time it self whispered by great sages tru history it self...





GIT GOOD
I guess completing Titanfall 2 on master difficulty 5 times with no deaths means I'm bad at gaming
I love him being on screen and the animated stuff in screen as well
Dark souls:having trouble?
You:yea i keep dying from this boss
Dark souls:we the solution is simple "git gud"
16:39 so THATS what happened to my bloom!
As someone who plays esports, our line for "good" is top 100 in the world.
Spoiler





Watching this whille fighting sekiro's dad.
Demon souls punished you. Unless you could get humanity you got 10% of your max hp cut each death to a maximum of 50%
Plot Twist:



Hard mode is actually the easy mode
I mean I choose to play all games on the hardest difficulty because it's more fun that way and more challenging. Plus the feeling of accomplishment of defeating a hard boss is amazing!
I haven't beaten Sekiro yet, but I've beaten all the Souls games and Bloodborne. I'm glad Sekiro doesn't have an easy mode. I feel like a total badass every time I kill a single enemy, and that's all that matters.
When did you start using a green screen I actually LOVE IT
A game called Warriors Orochi 4 camme out and in that game characters have access to sacred treasures
And some of them have access to Mjolnir (aka Thor's hammer)
And I was wonderring if those characters would be actually considered "worthy"
I like not taking sides, but these days that just makes both sides rip your head off. 

Too many people right now have a, "if you're not with us, you're against us mindset". Honestly, it's really unhealthy...
And lastly i think the boss also have the boss have immunity for 1-2 seconds on sekiro
Lol never played any of those example games cause I was too busy getting good at Darks Souls. Git gud Matpat.
MatPat: your not actually good at playing games
Pro Gamers: you have confused me as i won more times than you noobs
MatPat: you are the one who is the noob
Fortnite gives its players better server connection if they buy multiple battle passes. This has been proven
And then theres Sekiro:
"Yeah I can totally survive one more hit without healin"

dies
I play life on Nightmare Mode. Wish I had an option sometimes.
Well as they say "ignorance is bliss". Yeah, I still want to know my difficulty settings.
imagine talking about difficulty adjustment and not talking about GOD HAND
Where has this quality been? An actual nuanced out of the box perspective on one of the dumbest conversations in gaming? Damn Pat you might have me back a subscriber yet.

BUT WHY MUST YOU PULL MY PAIN FROM THE ETHER BY REFERENCING BESTFRIENDSPLAY? T_T
sees angry mob coming for matpat
Just a normal day for Matt üòÖüòÇ
The hardest game I ever played was Halo 2 on legendary.
As expected, generalizing as if that applies to most games and not a few examples. Typical MatPat. Good episode! üëç
I love a Hat in Time's handling of this in its Death Wish mode. If you die too many times in some of the most cripplingly unfair challenges I've seen in a game, they offer to make it easier for you.

This automatic sneaking in of DDA may have worked back then, but now that more and more players are understanding these mechanics, I feel like they should offer a way to let players choose.

Especially when it comes to multiplayer, player-versus-player matches. For the Gears of War example, how about implementing a "Ranked Mode," which would deter most casual players in name alone, so the developers could remove these handicaps.
Actually, I am a disabled gamer with the platinum on Sekiro, so I tend to think I am pretty decent at games.
MatPat: Your not as good at games then you think you are

Me:
YOU DARE APPOSE ME MORTAL
I like how matpat shows like alot of other content creators and credits them.
So basically, it's the JC Penny Effect, but with gaming. Whatever.
Did I ever say I was good at games?
Because I‚Äôm not, because I play sandbox games like terraria, besige, and gmod
Wait terraria has a hard mode... maybe I should start playing expert mode
petscop made more videos and 21 is realy weird
Sekiro's Default mode is the easy mode, you can ring a bell to put it on hard
So basically Sekiro has an build in easy mode then ;) RIP people who brag they are good at that game and tell others to git gud!
This is why I play tf2, it can‚Äôt be made easier. It depends entirely on the lobby, and that makes it a lot more fun
Why the new format I like the previous format. Nothing personal.
NOT GETTING OVER IT.
DDA: Even if you die one time, I¬¥ll make sure to adjust everything for your pleasure.
Me: restarts whole mission/stage/mode/game to keep the difficulty unaltered
DDA: insert surprised Pikachu face
Makes sense when you consider the multiplayer outbreak recently. I would rather be challenged by another human than be lied too in your pillowy difficulty.
I had no clue there was even a controversy about Sekiro lol I knew about the bloodborne and Dark Souls one's way back but that's about it apparently I just don't care and don't spend enough time on the internet looking at that stuff. And to the other stuff about games making it easier than you originally thought I also just don't care I play games to have fun I don't know about everybody else but that's it I sit down and play a game because it's entertainment sure sometimes I like a little bit of a challenge but most of the time I'm playing on easy or normal I very rarely go too hard but I also never got mad that bloodborne didn't have an easy mode but hey that's just me
Laughs in Nocturne
I mean the only part in sekiro that I don‚Äôt like is the dragonrot. The game play is demanding but fair. Just let me fight lady butterfly with out being worried about anybody else that I‚Äôve met along the way
I wish my life had D.D.A
Been crying since I was born.
One other game you didnt mention with superb DDA is Left 4 Dead 2. l4d2 uses a program called "the director" (named as the loading screen/end cards are shot as if the campaigns were movies). The director's job is spawning zombies and items. This happens differently each playthrough and is based on:
>player location
>player health/ammo
>time since last horde/special infected
>distance to saferoom
>estimated thrill rating
>player's items

This meant you are always on your toes, no two runs of a chapter are the same. it's awesome
I like how the games lie to u
Prior to this video I thought DDA was created for RE4
So this is why overwatch is impossible for me now.
thank you for giving me another excuse for dying MatPat!

Friend : Why are you dying so much? are you really this bad?

Me     : What? pfft no... h-havent you seen the new video on  The Game Theorists? This is just strategy... y-yeah, strategy.
I mean, this is all nice, but the simple existence of the soulsborne series proves that none of this is necessary to making good games, and justifies the existence of the Sekiro debate.
Sekiro doesnt give you hidden hp. Ir activately lowers your chance assist probability the more you die. Your answer on dynamic dificulty to the 'Sekiro Controversy' does not relate to the Sekiro actual design.
0:56
Matpat: Galatians 4:16
hey MatPat wheres my kirby theory?? (evil kirby ya know??!!)
Sekiro was easy.......... for this type of game. Darksouls 3 was more difficult for me. They should have made this game harder. And ringing the bell didn't make it any harder for me.
Made me laugh in under a minute, you get a like, sir.
i love these types of videos
I remember getting the aku mask of shame if i died two many times ind crash bandicoot, i was very disapointed in myself
To be fair, DDA works in reverse too, like in RE2(remake) upping the challenge by giving zombies a second lunge if you're doing too well for example.
so does sekiro make things easier... idk
so does sekiro have difficulty settings... idk
so does sekiro give you items... or change ai... idk
is this click bait, cause i didnt hear barely anything about sekiro, and thats why i came here
just proves games are just another piece of art to be enjoyed, not some standardized test to be "good enough" for
I‚Äôm a master at vidja games, I finished dark souls in like ten minutes
I remember demon souls becoming harder every time I die....
2 views, 1 comment, 23 likes.  Balanced, as all things should be
"Welcome to 2019 where if there's outrage to be had it will be had" the truest statement
I think DDA is a really interesting topic, but when I think about all the game I ground my face into to beat, now I have no clue which challenges I overcame and which ones the game dumbed down for me... Its really disheartening tbh
I had a feeling this was happening but I thought I was just crazy
I think games for kids should be easy, games for teens should be normal, and games for adults should be hard.


E for Easy
E10+ for Eh 10 year olds?
T for Teen Normal
M for Mother Fu- 
Honestly though, imagine if Epic Games is still implementing this 'New Player Buff' in Fortnite? I can already see the Twitch Highlights: "YOU'RE SO TRASH, I WOULD'VE KILLED YOU IF YOU DIDN'T CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT EVERYDAY TO BUFF YOUR PUMP DAMAGE!"
Death by creepers to much in MC. They lower the spawn chance for Creepers
This was great! I love dev based theories!
Play titanfall 2 on master. Living hell, no joke. Took me 20 hours want a challenge. Pick it up for like 10 bucks. Totally worth it.
i realized this playing last of us in hard mode, if you die to much they give you waaaaay more ammo for every kill.
Epic games worked on something that wasn‚Äôt fortnite

Now I‚Äôve heard it all
13:50 he also mentions that it becomes harder for better players
0:45 wait but i already think im bad at games
so does that mean im MEGA bad at games?
You want an actual hard mode? Go play a simulator.
But still, DDA is apart of difficulty levels.
"Your not as good as you think you are." 


No matpat i believe you. Most gamers suck. Heck even people who are professional can messup once and again. And NOBODY can beat a speedrunner. Sometimes not even other speedrunners!
Well, I'm still proud of my victory in Octopath Traveler, even though I needed a guide. Because I almost died even with the recommended strategy but managed to survive and eventually defeat the last boss
I don't care if anyone calls that a hollow victory. Also, the fight was more fun that way.
As a pen'n paper gamemaster I have to say that the most important thing in the game design should be the fun of the players even if you have to lie sometimes.
lol shots been fired to  DOOOOOOMM players lolol
Matpat! Do you remember poppy? If so, i think u need to take a look at this comment...


Ok so poppy has changed drastically YEARS after you released a video on her. She's now made weird videos about a scary mask, the icky babies...and made a website called @ ! 

I'd look up that if i were you. Believe me, you got a LOT to decipher!

I won't spoil anything else, this is all the info I'll give you. Plz make another theory on Poppy! Trust me, you won't regret it!
MatPat: You‚Äôre not as good at video games as you think you are
Me: Dies in 900 korok seeds
You should do a theory on whether the "Golden Crown" from s1 e6 of game of thrones would kill a man
Funny cuz in sekiro you start off in easy mode you can then ring a bell and get into a harder mode then in new game + make it even harder
I think it's much better to just have DDA running in the background than choosing a difficulty setting, at least that would be my personal preference. The reason being that it would feel more organic, as long as the game was adjusting itself as I got better I would feel that reward of improving and not just be babied at one set difficulty for the entire experience.
The day that all games remove difficulty settings is the day I give up on video games.
Damn, Last time I was so early, game journalists couldn‚Äôt even pass a tutorial...







Nothing has changedüòõ
First minute and I‚Äôm left laughing, good job
Jucied 2 or 3 can‚Äôt remember had to most obvious instances you were losing badly one round and next round you were Lewis Hamilton, the only explanation I can think of is your character was being pumped full of eurobeat
But you didn‚Äôt even talk about sekiro üòÇüòÇ damnit
I always play on normal mode first, and then try a harder difficulty the next time I play through it.
It‚Äôs surprising how civilized the comments are ü§î
So you saying if I play at least on Hard mode, but usually the hardest mode available, then I'm as good as I think?
I finished bloodborne a few months ago and god it was amazing so satisfying
For f sake. This should be illegal. Or at least it should be illegal to not have an option to turn this "dynamic difficulty adjustment" off.
I feel really sad now. It's probably even worse than lootboxes.
P.S. Really hope the hollow knight does not have such a thing.
Epic games can taste
My

I'll only accept an Easy Mode in Sekiro if its named "Game Journalist mode".
You didn't even mention Sekiro...
I thought MGSV's easy mode was playing with Quiet or D-Dog, using a HUD and deploying forces to sabotage enemy equipment, and its hard mode was removing the HUD, no buddies and letting enemies have all of the equipment
Hah! Go figure. I thought it was just game bugs when I noticed this kind of thing before.
Player be damned on difficulty curves.
I feel it should be something like
easy mode = story mode
normal = Dynamic Difficulty
Hard = Hold nothing (back good luck) + Insults for failure is also ok
That system of having the first shot always miss sounds like a really good mechanic.
My eyes are openedüò∂
Am I the only one to always choose the hardest difficulty whenever I get a new game?
In Sekiro, the true attack power is actually 3 higher than the listed number. At 1, it's actually 4, at 17, it's actually 20. Also, your actual damage gain decreases: at 15 (listed) AP,  you gain only 8 damage, while for all previous points you gained 20. It halves once you reach 28, and at 52, it increases your attack by less than one per damage point.
When Matpat started I legit thought this was a deadlock.
I am the one person not offended by matpat saying: get better because i do not play shooter games i play games like cattails and stardew valley
"Oh sweet! The difficulty rating is a lie! I got dis :D"
prances into the difficult songs of literally any rhythm game on their hardest difficulties
i always suspected dda was a feature as a kid. i would die multiple times to a boss and it seemingly got easier. i never looked it up but i felt like it was a thing
This video made me think and I have had this feeling for a very long time. There is not a "good" or "bad" player. It's more like the the experienced versus the inexperienced. Learning the video games have always had functions that slightly adjust its difficult settings, made me think if I am really good as I think I am or rather have I played enough video games. The answer is I simply haven't played as many video games as I thought I did. Then again, I forget that video games are systematic. Level difficulties mean nothing--it's all about how many hours you put into playing the game that makes you feel like a winner. You are going to overcome that level eventually or just figure out how to play it more. Video games are designed for you to have fun and this proves it.
1950: there will be flying cars in 2019
2019: global discussion about adding easy mode in games
Ha jokes on you losers I play on the hardest difficulty all the time you noobs
Only watched this video cause of the thumbnail
TL;DR Should Sekiro have easy mode? No.
In most Street Fighter games when your health bar is under 50% you receive 90% of the damage instead of 100% and after some point it decreases to 75% but everybody that spend a decent amount of time on SF knows this so at this point it is a game mechanic.
I mean, anyone who's played Mario Kart has known this for years. The only difference is that we had another name for it: "Rubberbanding".
I like easy mode because I play for the story
Sekiro is the easiest title in the souls series and dark souls three could be beaten by my 10 year old niece
Am I the only one who died over and over to get the special power up on a level I couldn't beat on Mario bros Wii when I was younger?
@The Game Theorists, ever heard of SMG4?  No?  Too bad, because guess what.  I just did a theory on his recent video about a kidnapped inking and who that captor might be and why.

But it's not just any theory.  IT'S A CRIME THEORY
So, there you have it. Sekiro just don't have any DDA.
GIT BETTER
Solaire from astora: hold my beer
I wish Overwatch made the game easier when the smurf on the other team is popping off
This game gives me anxiety, if i sit on the PC i don't want that, artistically a masterpiece but i sincerelly can't stand the fight after fight after fight every 10 minutes
epic games = internet casino
they are so very very clever in how they can get u do what they want
like a psychologist
I mean an AI has the capability to shoot a weapon with 100% accuracy and react to our actions the millisecond we press the button, so of course games have to go easy on us in most circumstances.
Add an easy mode for another $60
I think a lot of people here should watch Dunkey‚Äôs video on Difficulty in Videogames. For those who are familiar with the Dunk, it‚Äôs a surprisingly serious video
Not sure what to call it, but using items is the easy mode in Sekiro.
That is all well and good, but have you ever played Uncharted on crushing or higher?
I don't think we should be antagonizing dynamic difficulty in single player games. They are there so more people have fun with games. It helps the industry as a whole.
bold of you to assume i am good at anything
Theres no such thing as dynamic difficulty in Hotline Miami though :/
Sekiro doesn't have as interesting or creative and distinct compelling worlds and characters like dark souls and bloodborne had. - It's not a bad game, It's just not as good as previous from software games.
Speaking of hollow victories...you should play hollow knight
*leads off with sekiro*,
Shows no sekiro content 
Aware people: "but there's no sekiro" 
Matpat: "JUST A THEORY"
MattPat makes me smile.
First GT video I've watched in a while. Quality has gone up, nice.
I want that shirt, & I love the way it goes with the jacket.
I agree with the cons because niche games were not intended for broad audiences.
But I also agree with the pros because freemium toilet games use rigged difficulty as a mechanism to get money out of people.
Get good GET better try harder that is life one must fail to truly success at anything.
no one:
MatPat: creates a video about Sekiro and makes Kratos in a baby outfit the thumbnail
The other thing to consider as well is, easier modes allow people with disabilities for example or even just slower than usual reflexes to play the game at a level where they're comfortable, therefore making it more accessible to those people. I get why people are getting into a stink about it with Sekiro, because it is designed to be difficult. But difficulty in general is subjective in the first place.
i didn't know matpat had the ability to be controversial
Hey game theriost I have a question I would love you to answer what does this picture mean I found it at a un seen part of farcry 5
Guild wars 1 has a death leveling system. If you die a lot from a specific enemy, that enemy levels up XD.
Who really cares I play for fun easy hard whatever good for me
I‚Äôve always put game on hard bc the challenge is what makes the game fun.
Git Good intensifies
low frequinces in your recordings are absent  its hard to listen
Honestly my problem with hard modes is that enemies only become stronger, without being better skilled.
bullet sponged enemies that go down with hundreds of shots, or hits. is a salty experience. and it just becomes annoying, and repetitive
Ooooohhopoohhooo he said it. You just bad at games. Right now I‚Äôm on owl the Shinobi. But the games real good hahaha
Okay I thought I was going crazy. I never looked Into it but knew that dying  made it easier
Young nooblets have no idea what og gamers used to have to endure back in the day.  If you implement quest marker in the mid 90s, it'd be considered a cheat.
DO THE FORTNITE THEORY RIGHT NOW!!!!
So it‚Äôs basically Dark Souls with ninjas... me likey.
That was not a huge debate...

Some journos decided to cry about it and most everyone went 'yeah whatever'.
Sekiro isn't even that difficult. If you didn't give up and actually played you would agree.
Its called good game desing
Play Resident Evil : Revelation on the hardest difficulty and face the super Tyrant at the end. I am super good at R.E game and that took me over 50 tries to beat.
As a gamer who grew up with megaman instadeath and learned to appreciate it, don't adjust my difficulty without letting me know.
Matpat: Insulting people since 2009
On this episode of wacky voice YouTube person.
God, this is TOO MUCH! Just git gud scrubs.
I don¬¥t like the greenscreen presentator :/ I miss the voiceover
That last set of commentary ignores the very nature of difficulty adjustment.  For those who replay a game over and over, and actually do become better at a game, these things will stand out.  Meaning you still gain, as skills were developed.  This doesn't exactly take these elements away from those who have learned to master a game, like getting through Doom with virtually no to no Life loss, and no Armour loss.  Or getting through Resident Evil 4 with just the Gun and Knife, and never once getting hit.  At that point I would be experiencing the full might of the game.


Plus it isn't as though every game was developed with these elements in mind.  As you pointed out, Crash 1 did not have such a difficulty adjustment, and in multiple replays on most Turn-Based RPG's, I haven't seen any sign of difficulty adjustment regardless of how well I've done.  Though for those games, the cracking community tends to break down the game code to find out how they work, and I've never seen any sign yet of difficulty adjustment in the games I frequently play.  Just randomizers for enemy behaviour that can go very favourably for me, or work completely against me (like a full party attack that can crit, and happens to trigger just after another full party attack, and both crits and hits within the maximum allowed damage range causing a wipe or near wipe).  Looking through a cracking program to see the code as written, no adjustment element is present, just literal bad luck due to the general RNG seed that triggered based on the game/system clock and the choices made leading up to said boss that alters the RNG seed, which can be favourable of unfavourable.


It depends on a lot of details, and they're definitely not in every game series, but for sure in Action oriented games.  Not all of them.  I don't recall any adjustment in any of the original Castlevania games, or even the Metroidvania's.  Behaviour seems fairly straight forward and predictable regardless of damage taken, and how well I've progressed...whether I've died or not.  So even with games that require on-demand reactionary skills, it's not always present.


So at the same time...to your conclusion, both in terms of replaying and actually getting good (taking no damage, and witnessing the difference in behaviour/number of monsters on screen/health bar adjustments), and that I feel fairly confident stating it's not in every game (Crash 1 being a good example in your video...and I've beaten that game thrice now, it wasn't hard, but at the time I played platformers constantly, so my timing was good based on practice), and the clear advantage that practice in replaying these games would develop as a skillset where you would eventually see the true hard mode continuously would indicate you're dead wrong.  I don't feel robbed in my RE4 playthroughs, as I've experienced no-death runs plenty of times and yeah, they were harder than my original runs.
Fun fact: when Superman 64 shows its ending cinematic, it never disables the weird zooming effect. It persists into the menu, and if you start a new game, it just keeps bobbing in and out. Beating the game again without turning the console off will compound this effect.

EDIT: Here's a video of a guy beating the game twice in one sitting to demonstrate the compounding zoom effect: 
I see you on try not to sing matpat. Repping that GT merch
yeah, they are definetly doing that in fortnite. i got 4 kills in my first game, ive never gotten another kill since then.
Soo ... You didnt explain anything about sekiro...
I would rather choose my difficulty experience because I feel more accomplished with myself for beating harder difficulties in the game. I want to complete the game without the game feeling bad for me.
i honestly clicked on the video because i thought this was a god of war theory
Still yet I don't play most of the games you game theory on and still yet didn't learn my lesson of being a week late üòêüòê
Well, back to Skyrim.
maybe the focus on the addictive rush needed a more attention - btw.. yall been warned in 2006 - Boston Legal - Episode : Word Salad Days
Shadow die twice should have a Easymode DLC for 60 money. That would be fair
I didn't know about dda until now but i was aware the game is changing
Sekiro is the Dark Souls of games that aren‚Äôt Dark Souls
What about dark souls series?
Git Gud literally means "get better" though...
Now I have an excuse for not getting my victory royale
cal me corny but you never cease to make laugh with these intros XD
you all play on easy mode and cry about it?
ok
well
im done being a gamer
i play or hard mode and i find it boring you try
Also if you dont like a game by a certain developer then dont by their next one.
Game theory: get better
Community: grabs their guns and pitch forks
Game Maker‚Äôs Toolkit‚Äôs video on the ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô argument MatPat brings up in the beginning is actually pretty cool.
When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all
Didn't Valve openly admit this for Left 4 Dead series?
I'm Angry...because mere hours before I realized this video even existed, I encountered a phenomenon in one of my favorite games that began me thinking that something like THIS was possible...and now I have my confirmation that it is...
Let's just say I recently played a Battle-Simulator game where two standing armies fight over a territory; you lose when all your troops have been exhausted or when the enemy takes over all the command posts on the map.
I remembered even when I was a kid, on difficult battles, the numbers would come down close to the wire where I would be the ONLY troop left alive in my army, and yet somehow, I was more often than not able to pull-through and win - usually surviving to complete the objective to get a reinforcement bonus.


But today...I played the game again...and I noticed that after walking into veritable Bullet-Hell storms back when I was reinforced, trying to take-over the enemy camp....when it was just me...the enemy forces oddly dispersed; instead of converging all on my location to take me out...suddenly the areas I was sacrificing my men to capture were sparsely guarded...
And now...I'm left thinking that, all the times where I thought I was pulling off a Miracle - managing to snag victory away from the jaws of Defeat - was all just a lie...




Meanwhile, I play Brutal Doom - a mod for the original Doom Games, with a brand new Difficulty - "Realism Mode" - where weapons behave much more like their real-world counterparts. The player does about 200% more damage to the enemies thanks to the weapon-buff........But enemies do 900% more damage to him - you get one-shot by Lost Souls in this mode.
D.D.A. - crap they're not gitting gud, let's do the git gud part for them.
You know that feeling when you are so mad at the game you turn in to a ginger
There should be DDA in the other direction. If you succeed the first level with few to no deaths, then the difficulty of level 2 should ramp up accordingly
Could you make a theory on PvZ?
I'd rather spend a year of my life playing Sekiro and getting good rather then beating another Mario game in at max two days.
Haven‚Äôt been here in months did the production value go up slightly?
I literally was thinking of this while playing Assassin's Creed IV. Haha the NSA is listening!
Super meat boy and halo 2 on Legendary  still gives me nightmares
nobody:




people: IM MAD
Now I want to play on easy mode to get a chicken hat
When I saw this I thought it was a video about weather or not kratos is a good father 




Be cool video
12:03 "balanced as all things should be"
fortnite might actually have it idk....some times i feel as i get put in a lobby with fellow noobs
hell the first devil may cry game gives you an easy/auto mode that can be embarrassingly easy or as hard as normal mode depending on how well you do
Throwback to the office I still watch it on Netflix
Different games are designed to create different experiences. Lying to your about things is a tool to help you craft that experience. For games like bioshock it isn't about difficulty. You are literally immortal and enemies don't lose damage you inflicted before they shot you down. You cannot lose in the long term. It is an experience not a true challenge. The enjoyment of the game is exploring the world, story and adventure of Rapture not increasing your skill. 


Resident evil is about scaring the player and controlling how much tension you experience. Not killing you is important to that because if you die to much you stop fearing death.  They have to pull punches enough to not kill you while still making you think you are in danger. The emotional experience the game is going for requires you to always be in danger of defeat but not step over the line enough for it to be normalized. You aren't really intended to play parts over and over again until you get good enough that would ruin the experience.


Sekiro is the opposite they want you to die a bunch of time facing a foe so that you can grow as a player and feel satisfaction when you eventually pull off the win. Death is supposed to be a normal part of the game-play loop for you it is even a critical part of the narrative. In fact I wouldn't be overly surprised if they had a secret hard mode for some bosses the first time you fight them to make it near certain that you die the first time then ramp down to normal level.


Both styles of games can be great but trying to force one to have the others difficulty features damages the fun for the players.
i was expecting more sekiro
Crash is balanced....as all things should be......-Thanos 2017-2019
I'm surprised he didn't say anything about Nintendo
In gears of war, the person with the biggest buffs was always the host since they didn't have a half second of lag apply to their shots.
Hey figure out the speed of sonic the hedge hog from the new movie
I find that when I play a game a second time and it is just as easy if I pump it up a difficulty level or if I can‚Äôt I pump it up I play it on the same level and I blast through it
I thought the last health unit having more value and the first shot missing was known knowledge and fell under good game design
I'll go on record and say I don't believe Nuclear Throne has any sort of DDA built in to it.
The harder the better ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Dude, the thing where your health goes to zero +1 is usually very noticeable and annoying, it‚Äôs not a good thing

Dude,,,, same thing goes for all that other adjustment stuff, it‚Äôs incredibly noticeable and makes me personally feel like I‚Äôm never winning because all of a sudden right as I‚Äôm trying to learn them they do things that are easier to counter and take more damage

When stuff like this happens I feel like the game gave up
Do a Game Theory on Lobotomy Corporation please... it really needs it... I won't stop... please...
Sekiro's Default mode is the easy mode, you can ring a bell to put it on hard
I like this new format of video, sorta reminds me of the OLD game theory
I know im kinda of late, but hollow knight is difficult as hell. And now im afraid that hollow has a difficult adjustment for new players...
if you put an easy mod in sekiro you litteraly turn an 20-30h 1st playthrough to a 3-5h one
do that too. Having the developers intentionally cut content to artificially extend the life of their games is just disingenuous to the consumers.
Every game on my console has DDA. I nearly noticed it but now I feel like a noob
You should do the 2nd cube event in fortnite.  It would be much appreciated since no one else has covered it yet.
I'm a new YouTuber  and I need help
I don't like dynamic difficulty.  If I select a difficulty level, I want it to stay there.
Matpat: "you're just not as good as you think you are"
Brie Larson: is that like a personal attack or someting?
But does Sekiro have a Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment?
I thought everyone pretty much already knew this. Especially that it was in RE4.
The only thing I found mildly surprising was the Gears of War thing
That greenskin MatPat cameo!!!! YEEEEE!!!
16:36 you just opened a black hole there my friend
Thank you gaming industry for making me feel like I‚Äôm good at things even though I suck.
Thanos Bandicoot 
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
alright so this doesn't really matter, if im so good at the game than it doesn't change anything
So matpat just told us to GET GUD
I already knew I was bad at games I think I have beat 1 game on normal mode and it was a sports game
I liked the videos more when MatPat was just a animated image /:
so roblox has the same thing?
D.D.A: Aw crap, his son is playing. Quick, everyone, act natural!
Hey when is the new Kirby video coming out just curious don't wanna rush you
How about those MOBA game?
That fake endurance health bar you speak of... I swear must have been given to all enemies in bloodborne. Can't count how many times I've died thinking they have no hp left and they kick me in the nuts.
laughs in a hat in time
laughs in hollow knight
I personally really can't understand all that complaining behind this difficulty stuff.... The games get easier because you suck at playing it? Why should I care? I want to play a game and not try to find out how much I suck...
MatPat: ‚ÄúYou give a guy an inch they take a mile‚Äù

Sony: COPYSTRIKE CLAIM
Not good at games?pshhhhhhh.I beat some guy on Final Destination,fox only, and no items.
If you play the game just for a pastime and for the fun of it it wont really matter.
Id say no easy mode is needed. Like just watch a video if you need to see it to the end
Since when did Matt start using green screens?
Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... And my arm... even my fingers... The body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you?
Why is Kratos in the Thumbnail?????
I swear to God if sekiro got easier because I kept dying imma be pissed
Even with all of these boosts and help there are still players that suck at games.
You're just spilling all the tea aren't you
After watching the video I realized I am bad at every game
Could you stop blowing up the traveler most of us aren‚Äôt evil I promise
the micro transaction thing got me lmfao
"You‚Äôre not as good as games that you think you are..." --So true! But I'd also argue that Sekiro has a built-in easy mode, unlocked the first time you beat it on "regular difficulty". The problem is, there's no way to turn it off! Everything becomes too easy, if anything.
I've mastered every dark souls game. The combat in sekiro is just a turn off. You have to react in the few ways that the game allows. 

"It's just not your game. It's just not for you. Get good scrub."

You can criticize the game without wanting an easy mode. You hyperbolic Cunts.
Gotta say man, you've got probably the single best intro in gaming YouTube. The music never ceases to give me chills and I'm always excited to watch. :)
R.i.P BEST FRIENDS PLAY
RE4 a horror game? It was literally the easiest game of the RE Series
Okay but, like... I think the thing to be included here is that while DDA will make the game easier after you fail a bunch... if you DON'T fail, it keeps it hard.  And even then, there's a certain point where you DO need to 'git gud'

Lets take a boss fight.  if you keep dying to the same boss, sure, his health might get lower, attacks weaker or more telegraphed... But he'll never get to a point where he just sits there with 1 HP and doesn't attack.  And I KNOW that's hyperbole out the wazoo, but, it's still a point to be made, that there IS a lower end to DDA.

Many easy modes far outpace that idea, or make it so certain types of enemies don't show up, or bosses don't use certain attacks, because it would be 'too difficult'  and there comes a line where an 'easy mode' is simply 'not playing the game how it was meant to be played'  and that's not a good thing.
Glad this wasn‚Äôt actually about the Soulsborne franchise.
I knew dynamic difficulty was definitely a thing, but I didn‚Äôt realize it was this widespread and pervasive
Maybe is good idea to make book theory.That is my suggestion because there is a lot of interesting books.
Games should be difficult tbh
you're right, i used to be very good at games when i was young, i guest it all has to do with reaction time and finger and eye coordination... that's why i can't even beat EIR in God of War
If u noob but want easy mode just use hacks
what if someone sux and wants to get better but the game wouldn't let em because the game made it easier after too many deaths and that guy wouldn't even know
You beat Superman 64 three times!?! 






you need some cookies üç™üç™üç™
What if fortnite ups the chance of getting better stuff in chests when you start
You should be able to turn DDA off :/
Sonic is now a thing





Again
As long as I'm having fun I don't care.
all these talks of skilled vs casual players, but don't even consider how the game is designed

these games aren't designed with highly skilled players in mind, skilled players would always be good at the games they play. these games were designed for people who are willing to persist and learn from mistakes. hidetaka miyazaki the games director even admitted he wasn't good at these games, but grew to love them because it thought him persistence and hard work. 

should all games not have easy mode, NO. but sekiro, dark souls, any game game designed that way shouldn't. it would rob you of what its trying to convey and teach you.
HEY what's about Cuphead hmm what's the DDA on that there cant be one on that
2067 anyone? (Sorry :c)
Of course not all games should have an easy mode. Do you expect a trophy for just trying?
Hell yeah twisted metal 2 That was one of the hardest PlayStation games I‚Äôve ever played Died two times before leaving the first level every time
A lot of players say Sekiro is too hard because they think it should be played like dark souls or Bloodborne. But combat is entirely different and does not rely on dodging
So easy mode could become even easier?
It‚Äôs true Fortnite noobs get better loot and do more damage
Petscop 18 is here
Sekiro was fun after i figured it out lol
To be honest, I personally don't like it if you run arround on the screen, I like it better to just hear the voice...
But I still love that awesome animation ;D
‚ÄúYou are not as good as you think you are‚Äù

Joke‚Äôs on you, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna old at all...and not just in video games.
MATPAT YOU NEED TO DO A THEORY ON PETSCOP NOW THEY HAVE 18 THROUGH 21
I like making my own ways to make games harder. #replayvalue
I thought this was common knowledge?
Me: (Sees that its only been 2 minutes since it was uploaded) Yes im gonna be early
Also me: (Sees that there are 7.8k views already) And I thought I was early
I think one remedy to this problem would be to have dynamic difficulty adjustments as something the player chooses, like a switch they can toggle off and on. They can have this along with easy/normal/hard mode or as a difficulty level in and of itself. Of course this would mean that the developers would have to be public about them having DDA in their games, and whether or not they would want to I‚Äôm not sure, but it could help solve the problem.
I don't think dark souls has a hard or easy mode it just is fun and you learn from your mistakes
Actually, yea. I've known this for a long time, ever since my father explained it to me as a kid. No idea how he knew (I assume it's because he has game developer buddies), but he did. I never felt like any games were ruined as a result. Most of the time you don't even notice. You'd rather have the game "fix" itself so that way you can continue to play, instead of getting stuck at the same part a billion times.
I feel you giving me therapy
Matpat stop messing around! Kindergarten 2 is coming in a couple of months






Be aware...






Nugget Returns!
People who want easy mode to be in every  game are snowflakes
Dear journalist: Just download the god damn trainer
To be honest my level on spider man PS-4 is friendly (easy) and I got killed multiple times fighting WILLIE! Even though I was a noob and had never played the game before, I did the story again and STILL had trouble fighting him! Lol
pls do a theory on fran bow
I remember the days of Contra
I struggled trying to finish the game as a kid back then, meanwhile my Dad finished it and he didn't even knew about the Konami code

It was a fun experience nontheless, difficult video games by default are a fun experience on their own different from other easier games.
awwwww i want the animated matpat better XD
in mortal kombat the more you die in tower or story matches the easier the fights
in mortal kombat the more you die in tower or story matches the easier the fights
Matpat picks the Frumpy side
Crap this fight is to hard.
Turns to easy mode and one shots boss with crappy bow and sword
Better
DDA dosnt apply to touhou series i guess
Please please add 60fps back to game theory
See, I don't notice things like this because I play actually COMPETITIVE shooters, (mainly Overwatch and CS:GO) and not things like COD or non-competitive things like that.
You git gud when you beat any from Software game.
Wow.... People didn't realize that this was a thing? I've always noticed in certain games would lose enemies or they'd become easier.... Huh
Hello Mr. Patrick, Mrs. Patrick and the rest of the Game Theory crew,

After hearing the announcement of Borderlands 3 being released sometime this year, my brother (linguaphiliax) and I (Jac.A.Cameron) had come up with a hypothesis.

We predict that Borderlands 3 will reveal the secrets behind the telekinetic alien of the pre-sequal (with a hint of Australian pride). We believe that they are part of species created from the vault. In addition, sirens are people who are vessals of vault energy that could've mutated their parents (similar to radiation causing people's offspring developing deformities). Or... Or, the Sirens are a sub-species/hybrid of the vault aliens, like a mule or tiger-lion. (Unlikely, as I don't think Jack would be open to that idea)

Evidence;

- The protectors of the vault in the pre-sequal have an almost identical design to the alien except of their mask which is probably used to categorised which vault they're assigned to.

- Both the protectors and sirens are both affected by eridium with an increase in power.

- If the Sirens' powers are created from radiation, then that energy has to be generated from somewhere. We think the Eridium is radioactive with it's purple glow. 
                  -----In addition to the other evidence, Angel was a powerful enough to control all of Hyperion technology. If Handsome Jack had a large sum Eridium, Angel would have developed the abilities from the radiation.

We hope you have the best of luck unpacking this theory. We had a lot of fun discussing this idea.

May many more theories come
- Jac. A. Cameron


(PS. That's my signoff, fyi)
In assassins creed origins the part where you flee from an elephant with julius caesar, if you die to the elephant often enough the elephant eventually stops chasing you.
I prefer the kind of hybrid one seen in Bioshock: it does all kinds of tricks in the "regular" and easy modes (for those not interested in fully learning the game to experience what it wants to tell), but removes all bullshit and gives you the straight difficulty on a hard mode.


I also liked how Pillars of Eternity presents the difficulty to you, suggesting you to go on easy mode or like a "story mode", having the "regular" mode be what they truly want you to experience, but then you have to commit, and many will do but at least you know what you're getting into.
Demon souls does it right
As a gamer, I don't really like how games can just automatically adjust to make things easier without your consent. However, from a game design/business perspective, I think it is absolute genius.
i feel like easy modes should be there for players who need/want it, as it won't ruin the game for other players who want to be able to play the game "as it was intended."  people who choose an easier mode will be less skilled than people who chose higher difficulty settings, so why does it matter? those higher skilled players will nearly always beat those who chose easier modes (and plus they get bragging rights). i really dont see what the big deal is. i do definitely prefer the game NOT lying to us (dda) because then that achievement would be genuinely satisfying. but, still, with dda, its just as satisfying. i dont think it matters whether dda is there or not.
ohhh this makes a lot of sense! game devs are so smart
Wut about online games
I didn't even know there was a controversy over the beginning thing. I do now, I guess!
Crash was really bad at hiding its DDA. Those extra checkpoints stuck out like a sore thumb.
But honestly, dynamic difficulty adjustment seems like the best way to go for a video game. It also makes zero-death and other similar challenge runs just that much greater as accomplishments.
Is that why alot of weapons in fortnite leave you at 1-15 hp left if you were full health and shields?
You can‚Äôt become better until you admit you‚Äôre faults. Sekiro is easy for me cause it makes me strategise instead of rushing into fighting.


I thought I was the best race game driver in the world. I often set world records online in games like Dirt 2. Then Dirt Rally came out and I soon realised I had to use the physics to win rather than rewinding or restarting.
12:10 also pokemon yellow had the DDA
I miss the old game theory, but I love Mattpatt too
I'm so happy you mentioned The Super Best Friends! They've deserved some exposure bucks for awhile, especially now that they've broken up.
Wow! ‚ÄúFirst World Problems‚Äù, huh? lol
Destiny 2.
Is it just me or..i start on the hardest dofficulty allowed, or hard mode. What can i say. I aint got room for ghost *mlg glasses*
So "beginner's luck" is a part of the software.
Leave it to MatPat to tear open old wounds of my weird dads getting a divorce.. RIP Best Friends Zaibatsu
11:51 "Perfectly balanced... as all things should be. "
What about roguelikes and dwarf fortress, fortress mode?
What if this is also the case for FNAF? :p
I've known about the difficulty adjustments for a while. It's something that was talked about with Spyro 2 and 3. I know a few speedrunners talked about it a lot and I feel like I read it elsewhere in the early 2000's
"You're not as good at games as you think you are."
That implies that I think I'm really good at games. I am, in fact, more or less mediocre.
So that's why a bot in fortnite one pumps me with 170 health. Smhüòπ
Whi hear thought they were good at games before playing "Getting over it"
so me refusing to unlock certain skills in AC:Origins while playing on Nightmare and delaying use of health regen as long as I could was actually playing game the right way >.<
CRASH BANDICOOT! You filthy pleasant experience of my childhood!
Maybe a notification that would pop out after 5 death wheter you want to ease up next fight, or continue dying would be mature way to solve that issue.
bioshock is still one fo the best games ever... maybe it's because of those design choices... wait...
Then there are JRPGs where for the most part are like "you play our game, you've no choice fool"
Man, Shadow of Mordor punishes the gamer by buffing the guys that kill you
the most difficult boss to beat in sekiro... is the camera.
Yeah that explains why when you boot up pubg mobile for the first time, 90% of the enemies in the maps are clueless bots.
My favorite thing about this is Sekiro it's actually taking it easy on you in your first playthrough. In NG+ and on you have the option of giving up Lord Kuro's charm and without it you still take damage when blocking unless you land a parry properly.
gaming journalists don't represent "gaming community". so no. there is no and never was a controversy. Difficulty is part of developers artistic choice. 

cant handle it? go watch a lets-play or a walk-through there's a lot of them.
I love the new style with real life MatPat!
Boy howdy does MatPat like minefields for breakfast. I followed the video until you repurposed the original tweet against game journalists. Which most of that controversy sparks from them constantly being unable to play video games then whining about it.
NBA 2k does this a lot!!!
I got the Brass Balls achievement
When MatPat calls you out on your gaming skills üòü
So how'd u like the flashlight wink wink üòâ
Hold up!!!!! what u say about metal gea......oh yeah that chicken haat is worth billions, moving on. Yeah i did notice that when i played the first Assassin's Creed. As a gamer who constantly looks for that "thing"... that 1 thing that nooooo one does because they haven't  discovered that makes you look like:
"His Royal Highness Warlord Supreme Allied Commander Emperor Admiral Presidental Leader of the Free World Sky Marshal Boss Senpai Wrack'n Shyt Kahn The Third" (yep)
While making the most combat hardened vets look they got rejected at tryouts for the "Noobie Nooburton Show"
I wanted to kill everything with hidden blade counters, thus i spent hours in that last bit of life bar...which damn near lasted as long as my entire life bar. Suspicious huh? I didn't know why then but now i understand...i was not truly deserving of all my titles.(sad Kitchen sad, sad, Kitchen)...but it's ok, i'll use what the devs taught me and add a few more before i take them off. I'll add something like "Slayer of Titans" or " Archmage Primarch "  hmm "Prime Minister of the Fatilitis Strikes" ( kinda like that one....what was i talking about? oh yea) "Forgetter of Current Tasks" lmao
But that's just a comment
a comment, in the comment section of
 Gaaaaammmmmeeee  Theory 
Facccccce
I completely forgot about RE4's adaptive difficulty(or DDA)...changing enemy drops depending on what equipment you use....its actually quite easy to abuse it if ya know it well enough
GET BETTER VS DEVICE = #MORON!!! 
they might be better than you think JUST maybe your 1000000000$ Device is a OP PEACE of crap ever try playing with a lower spec device or more crappy internet OR ever think there was a suspicion like  the bullet did not go strait or hackers are geh???
Mat: "You not as good at games as you think you are"
Me: laughs in nuclear Ganghi
I always kinda sensed this as a kid.  It . . . felt unsatisfying if you lost a few times for me from then on.  Like, I didn't beat the version of the game I wanted to.  I failed, permanently.
Cool, that you aren't going to be taking a stance on the issue at hand. I feel like the channel should be unbiased, even though I liked the ones you did before, including the "Sans is Ness" one. That just leaves me to do it in the comments now.

In my opinion, games do not need to provide you with variable difficulties in order to complete them. The argument to the contrary lies in the fallacy that "you are entitled to get what you paid for." I would argue that you don't truly get what you pay for unless you complete the game the way the developers intended. That means if the developer intended you to go through hell in order to complete it, then you should have to do that. If they include an "easy mode," then the developer clearly intended some people to complete the game on the easy difficulty. Furthermore, what you are paying for is the ability to play the game and  If all of the proper means to complete the game are in place, then the developer is not responsible if you cannot personally complete it. That would be like saying "I don't own a controller, so it's the developer's fault that the game I paid for isn't complete-able without a controller, even though he intended it to be completed with a controller."
So zero deaths really count for something
lol, if its programmed into the game to make you better and you are then you are good at games
Matpat: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just not as good at games as you think you are‚Äù

Shroud: ‚ÄúHold my beer‚Äù
Love the live action stuff
4:28     
True
I was late to the Souls Party, I caught up as 3 came out. I do have to say that after bingeing the From Software catalogue, when I went back to another game and found myself mindlessly following a map marker, and even when I did die there was virtually no consequence, it was kind of an empty experience.
that's why dungeons and dragons is best
Instead of adding an easy mode
They should add a sicko mode
Is it just me or anybody also miss the old motion graphic matpat ?
What''s the point? People who who truely play games know this already, in speedruns these things also get abused, just like the "every time you die the game gets easier" method used by some game.
Leave me alone I am 10
Pick the middle side XD
That's why you always play at hard mode. Like Amnesia.



Don't play Amnesia in hard mode.
anyway sekiro is on easy mod by default. you are just to bad to realise it.
YoU'Re StIlL wRoNg
Another video came out today about the secrets off dead cells! A rouge like...with...get this difficulty adjustments...little secrets to make you seem good lol!
Dynamic difficulty makes people subconsciously think that life gets easier if you fail
Fun Fact: Miitopia doesn't have a Difficulty Mode so you can get Right into the Action without Worrying about a Single Thing. ^^
You are so boring you might actually be Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation
I know I'm not good at games, I am not a gamer, I have no intresst in games and I am not entertained by them. That being said, I like Nier:Automata, my sister made me play it, and I loved it as a work of art. I played it on easy mode, and if it had been in any other mode I woulden't have been able to finish the game. Easy mode was really hard for me. Easy mode is not for the experienced players who are good at games, it's for us who don't usaly play games, so that we can experiance stories we otherwise would not have. That is how I see it at least.
Why are people mad at an easy mode just don‚Äôt use it
As long as you enjoy it, does it ever even matter??
Name of the game is to make you feel like a badass, like he said your last 1 percent of health is likely more like 10 percent to create a feeling of just barely surviving. 
Other things games do is magnetize enemies to environmental hazards like railings and ledges when you kill them. You would feel alright if they just dropped dead but if they flipped over a railing when you shot them you feel like an action hero.
Well if your better you will still be seen as a better player than some one not as good as you and some games don't have this like Terraria and if your better you will probably be faster and on some of characters have very good items this took way too long to type on phone
-random viewer
I am of the opinion, that games should let the player decide how hard they want their experience to be. Don't alter a game's story or progression based on the difficulty either, cause that would defeat the purpose of letting the player decide. In my opinion, if the player gets to decide (especially for single player games like Sekiro) than there is no harm done. If you really want to get bragging rights, just give the players that beat the game an achievement for it. I think people can enjoy different aspects of a game and have different aspects be the "main" focal point of a given playthrough. 
If I like everything about Sekiro (I haven't bought or played the game btw.), the narrative, the environment etc. everything except the continuous dying to enemies part, why would you not let me do change that? It doesn't even have to be major changes for a different difficulty, just increase the health a bit, or lower the damage dealt by enemies a nudge depending on the difficulty level chosen etc. If I beat the game on an easy mode and then brag about it, then I am a liar and it will probably surface sooner or later anyway. If I have beat the game on the hardest mode, then the fact alone of having done that should be enough to satisfy my pride, since the challenge was overcome. If you get your satisfaction out of knowing that you are better than others, I think you might be playing games for the wrong reasons. And even then you should still be able to get that satisfaction, just by getting that achievement and being able to parade it around, maybe even get a special armour or something, something that looks cool, so you know you are better than most other players playing THAT game.
I think the other point, the "Authors Intent" or otherwise know as the "Death of the Auther" Discussion, is the reason for the arguments by developers. I believe that if you produce a game and sell it to the public, that as soon as someone purchases it, it is no longer your baby. You might have produced it, but it is now part of the world and it may get shaped into things you don't necessarily like, but that is the risk of releasing a project to the public, especially concerning art. I mean mods are the best example of the death of the author and mods are usually well received since they change something someone disliked about the game they bought but leave the game as it is for everyone else. No one else is hurt by this. 
Why does there have to be this gatekeeping for singleplayer games? Multiplayer, sure, that needs an in some way balanced gameplay so that there can be some sort of skill challenge between players, but singleplayer games? Really? I might actually get into Sekiro or Dark Souls if I could lower the barrier to entry just a bit, so that I am not AS underpowered. Sure, I wouldn't get to "brag" about it and I wouldn't join the "Band of Brothers of Dark Souls" who invested time and effort to become as good at the game as they are, but I might actually get into the story and experience that cool world for myself and try to uncover some history etc. My Mantra: The more options, the better. Have a default experience set when starting a new game but let the player change it. Give them a warning, that choosing any other difficulty will be an alternate experience form that intended by the creators and make the player have to actively click it away and the press start once more. 
If I buy a novel, the autor expects me to read from front to back. If I buy a movie the producer and director expect me to view it from start to finish. Once I have bought that book or that movie, I can read the book back to front, just read the intro and the end, read the middle and nothing else or watch the end then the beginning. When I buy a game, I am glad to know what the creator intends, but if I disagree with that vision, why should I have to waste my money just because the creator can't let go of their vision. I am not forcing them to acknolwedge how I play the game so neither should they force me to play the game how they want me to or how they would do. Obviously, as a consumer I am able to decide what I like and what the product provides, but adding something like a difficulty mode should be as basic as having the Settings/Options menu. Most developers don't force me to play at a certain framerate or pov, or with a certain volume, why do that for how hard or not I want my game? Those are just my thoughts. If you have read this far, thank you for your time. Have a great day :)
why is undertale the exact opposite lol
I recently played through the Konquest mode of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, and at one point in the Lin Kuei temple you have to run down a passage and avoid fireballs that are coming towards you by ducking into alcoves along the walls. The timing for this is extremely tight, where the slightest mistake could lead to your death and you would have to do it all over again. But, if you die twice while trying to get past the challenge, the fireballs slow down significantly.

The problem was, I knew this going into it, and it was pretty obvious what happened after I died a couple of times. And when I completed the challenge without any more deaths, I didn‚Äôt feel like I accomplished anything. In fact I felt robbed of the chance to get better. I would have rather had the chance to improve than the game force me into an easier situation.
MatPat, I had just remembered a game I played a few years ago. It‚Äôs called Ratchet and Clank and I think it has a lot of really good lore to it. Maybe look into it and see if it has anything to it. 



(I know you probably won‚Äôt see this but it was worth a tryüò¨)
Left 4 Dead
Mat i know that now tell me  something new
Honestly I am completely ok with being babied in video games. I play to have fun, if i die at every turn in a game it just gets boring. 
However, a bit of a challenge makes the success more satisfying. I remember playing Crash Bandicoot when I was a child and being blocked at some point in the game for so long, dying so many times that I cried. When I finally finished the game it felt so damn good. No game has ever made me feel this good ever since.
I‚Äôm playing cuphead and I‚Äôm not one of those people wanting a easier mode I love it being hard I feel better when I beat a boss
The Dishonored series doesn't have DDA boys.
Consistent after every death.
You need to do a theory about the 8bittheater falling off
What does really a lot outdated games have to do with sekiro . You should of focus less on examples and find out how sekiro specs . This video wasn't about sekiro it was about games in general but different games will have different algorithms so the effects you mention would have different extends or levels of lying if you will
We need a new Pok√©mon age theory
Sekiro did this with the Kuros Charm item
Why cant my life adjust, its already too hard
The DDA is not new.. STORYTELLING uses that ALL THE TIME. Every superhero comic book has moments like those.. and, even if sometimes we complain about them, or think they are strange, we keep reading/watching.

Now that I work, have a like, etc etc, is very difficult for me to spent 2 hours dieng in the same part of a game.. I dont want to improve on games, I want to improve on my REAL LIFE. If all you want is be better at pac-man - FINE, but other people don't care. But I love some of the stories, I love to smash or shoot some heads, so why I do need to spent the same time as you did to be "that good"? 

My money, my time, and I will spent it where I want =)
In Sekiro, you start with Kuro's charm, an Item that lowers difficulty, by default, so you play easy mode already, sorry not sorry
and even with those advantages, people want games to be even easier
G I T  G U D
During my university psychology course, we learned that: people who do the same activity over and over and get no results (aka playing a level in a game and failing repeatedly because of the difficulty) will be more likely to just stop playing. If people see something as impossible they won‚Äôt bother trying after a while.
Then you have Rome 2 where your units suicide in the enemy line if you aren't micro-managing them to hell.
Difficulty can lead to intelligence and skill, so gtfo
i like sekiro, and sure would like assist mode.. which is an easy MODS u can add for a boss that u really cant beat to progress through the story... but problem here is BOSSES CANNOT BE FOUGHT TWICE... sad.(well you CAN fight boss twice but u gotta fight it on NG+ where the only thing u good at which is posture recov is taken from u)
play a game cald ark its awesome
Conclusion is that minecraft is the best game because you can't win it

I've always played on the highest difficulty setting possible, no matter how frustrating. And yes, there were some really difficult games out there. Looking at you, Battletoads, Dark Souls, and SSBM All-star intense mode. Are there better gamers than me? Absolutely, no doubt about that.

It's just that I really enjoy challenges. I get that's not everyone else's goal, but it's mine. So... basically MatPat plays on easy/normal and is projecting his own insecurities onto us.  Git Better MatPat. Up that difficulty setting.
Great episode i learned a lot from this one
I love games with a struggle. I have no life. But still its a good feeling when making it to the end.
Matpat: I won‚Äôt say anything controversial 
Also matpat: you have been playing the easy mode your hole life
I miss the old MatPat who was just a big head and memes o.o
I like this new format
The cake is a lie xD
Gears of war came out the same year I was born
Making something look challenging without really being challenging is game theory 101.  Sid Meier highlights this as the core concept of SimGolf, and it's a valuable lesson to remember for all would-be game designers.
you need two more theory channels so all the bits of the circle are different colors
WOAH. MY LIFE IS A LIE. 


Seriously though, this is stupid. They shouldn't have added this.
Resident Evil 4 needed a dynamic difficulty adjustment for the quick time events like the Krauser knife fight by removing them entirely.   And Gears of War was a cheap knock off of RE4 btw, complete with a mine cart ride, rail shooter segment.


At , I love how the makers of Crash Bandicoot admit in their article that Mario 64 had better controls and balance.   Suck on that, Crash fans.   You too, Sonic.  Sorry, had to be said.


I don't think the Souls games had a dynamic difficulty adjustment, beyond the one where the player summons help or looks up tips like where to find certain items, how to make OP builds, or ways to cheese bosses.   "Git gud" usually meant "git help".
People can't accept the fact that they ARE being "babied"..
I don't really care how good I am at a game.
I just wana have fun.
Facts doesn't care about your feeling
I know this has nothing to do with the video,  put there‚Äôs new petscop videos
Intro song?
Still, everything is a lie. I wouldn't be surprised if vaccines caused anti-vaxxerism and the Earth is triangle
I don't even play that many games that often, and i knew that dynamic difficulty existed. Maybe because I'm just that bad at games lol
reality is often disappointing
RIP SBFP
Does Tetris have DDA?
You should make a gaming channel so you can use your game play for vids
Personally, I would be perfectly happy to play on a "dynamic difficulty", so long as it was clearly visible as an option alongside the standard difficulties, and provided I could tweak its behaviour to some extent. It would be good for overly-easy games that I'd usually just blow by, as the difficulty could ramp up over time.

I don't like the idea of dynamic difficulty being ever-present in a game without the players knowledge or consent however.
Like the topic, but not a fan of the new format...
Pretty as your face is MatPat, I  prefer you behind the camera. Bring back the litany of cringe-worthty meme photos, fan art, and unnessecary charts and graphs!
That is what makes your channel unique and enjoyable.
Please ditch the green screen effects, this isn't "Because Science", and you shouldn't strive to be more like other channels anyway!
You didn't even mention cuphead. It offers a simple mode, but when you beat your first boss on easy, Dice reminds you that you cannot complete the game if you continue on simple, so you have the choice to continue on easy or play on regular
I bet it goes the other way too though. Game getting harder because you're beating it too easily.
I think it's okay for games like sekiro to not have an easy mode. They brand themselves as being very difficult, so if you want to play it, you should be prepared for it to be hard. You're not owed the ending to the game, if you want to see it, play the game. A hard game is better value for money, as you will spend more time getting better at it (not to be confused with grinding in games like Pok√©mon where you as a player don't actually improve in skill)  and then winning becomes an actual achievement.

Part of the problem is that people have to share everything nowadays. They buy a game, they post that they're playing the game, and then they want to post that they beat the game and get recognition for doing so. They're not playing the game for the sake of enjoying the experience, so to those kinds of players, an easy mode is not just beneficial but preferential. Games that lock the ending behind difficulty prevent that type of person from posting they beat the game, because they have no final screen to prove it. (though it is a bit unfair not to warn the player beforehand that they may miss some elements of the game)
This is just another of those things where society are getting weaker. I don't want to be that guy like 'back in my day we played battle toads, died 99 times on the third stage and loved it' but removing the challenge from a game for the sake of 'inclusivity' is breeding a weaker mind that expects life to be made easier when they're struggling.
I was hoping he would talk about Left 4 Dead's AI director when dynamic difficulty alterations came up but good video all the same
Petscop is back....
all this stuff is so obvious i would be surprised if you didn't notice
Anyone knows where I can read that article from the Crash developers, that was really interesting!
Mat pat shouts out game maker's toolkit. Noice.
Okay, but that's just player experience stuff. Games are written to be fun and the systems you're talking about are designed to give you that feeling of being better than you might actually be. That doesn't quite translate to the Sekiro and Dark Souls discussion, because those games specifically just do not do that. 


 A hard game is frustrating, but the one thing From Soft does well is making hard... fair. Your deaths in From games tend to be fair which is why people accept it rather than just scream in anger constantly about it or shrug it off and assume it's just a bad game. It's a tightrope they walk in their game design and the fact that their company hasn't gone under for making such games shows, if nothing else, that they do it well enough to appeal to a wider audience. 


You asked early on, if I buy a game, am I not entitled to see all of it? To which I must then ask, does that mean all book writers have to write at a level open to all readers and content that is fun for all readers? If you buy a book, are you entitled to enjoy it? Because it does come down to allowing an artist to make the experience or requiring them to change it to open it up to a wider audience.


Personally, I wouldn't mind a difficulty slider. I find most of the people against sliders act as if they are forced to use them somehow, but on the other side of that coin, if From doesn't want a slider then I support them in that choice too.
half the games listed  for the secret adjustments are not beloved games bioshock 2 was a joke and gears of war while a interesting game really didn't and amazing godlike multiplayer.
as for res 4 its a survival horror game. if it didnt have a way to adjust the game play it would far easier for a player to get themselves stuck ie out of ammo no money and thus forced to restart the game. 
and if just because you try to hand wave away the fact that even if a game is lying to you about your health or ammo doesn't make that point  any less true because that games you listed DO NOT HAVE have dynamic difficulty adjustment.  bioshock does not its bioshock 2 that does. yes i know it doesnt have a bad metacritic but when you go and look at the forums there is no love for bioshock 2.  so all you did is go look at these games that you love see they have a fake health bar but its still matters because these OTHER games have DDA what the hell kind of logic is that.
2:25 lmao, love this
Mat when Joker come out : A new character? Can his bullets melt reality and time as we know it? By converting attacks into power, does he violate one of newton's laws?
I loved the dark souls games and when Sekiro came out I was challenged. I got used to the game but when I first fought Lady Butterfly I saw that the way I played wasn't going to get me to the end. I changed my play style to more blocks, a bit more aggressive with my hit and run attacks and after a good number of deaths beat her. That's the game I love because I found my own way through, not given one.
I only dislike how matpat's tone makes DDA sound bad. If the purpose of a game is for entertainment, people having a unique  game that they enjoy is good.
Petscope 5 more episodes make a video
But wait, you said that hard mode turned off a lot of the hand holding features so doesn‚Äôt that just validate hard mode being harder? I‚Äôm confused.
Game difficulties be like:

Git gud

Pok√©mon showdown be like:



Me be like:
On the other hand in elex you will be rewarded for playing ultra ( hardest difficulty) it might be extremely hard but you get more gold
I recognized RE4's difficulty adjustment the first time I played it, coincidentally, on the exact area you showed
Robin is that u?
I have intuitively known this, although I couldn't put it in words, some friends would say that each time you load a level it randomly spawns the enemies.  This did not sit right with me.  Sometimes I would learn the lay of the land so when I respawned, I would go to a good hiding spot and sometimes enemies were guarding the area. 

My best memory is playing Halo CE the level after the silent cartographer, I was like Matt Pat, I sucked, so I played it over and over and over again until I got good.  

There was one room mid level I could not clear.  When I spawned the room was empty, I had been playing 5+ hours so I thought where are the grunts and elites, have they gone on thier lunch break, so I walked through to the next room which only had a few grunts and basically was given some breathing room.
Crash bandicoot is "Perfectly Balanced" "as all things should be".
#gitgud
But do you think Sekiro and from software are using these dynamic difficulty adjustments? The absolutely could, as other difficult games does it, but is there any proof they do?
It could very easily be done if they wanted to, as there are no numbers to your attacks just meters moving down. But when good players die 10 times to a boss that should be enough already to turn away the "worse" players?
We're not mad cause it's true
I don't like that at all. I don't like getting put on an easier difficulty for dying.
Why sekiro wont have an easy mode? Simple answer: its from software the people who made dark souls, you really think there will be an easy mode.
Cacaw cacaw
If I ever make my own game you‚Äôll have to play it on the hardest difficulty in order to get the normal ending go easier than that you get the bad ending
Hey matt im was Always bad at games. so please tell me
Thought this was obvious. I realized this as a kid
I don't think games NEED an easy mode, but if there IS an easy mode then you don't need to complain about it.
So, are Souls games just Normal difficulty games that are being honest with players?
Hey matpat can there be youth size merch
Actually the walking stiff is the worst thing ever. I can‚Äôt disrespect video games by acknowledging it as one.
Hey make a hollow knight theory
And then there's demon souls
where can one request theories?
Beating Dark Souls made me a better player overall and changed me into enjoying a tough challenge in games. Before that, I hated loosing. 
I say, it's a change for the better.
He's right you know
Playing Bloodborne rn with a buggy right analog stick and just beat the Shadow's of Yharnam, actually could not get past Central Yharnam when it wasn't buggy, these games are a mix of trial and error, your own competency and it's systems. Honestly, from what I've seen Sekiro might be the easiest one with all it's higher stealth elements and mobility; This isn't a gamer thing, just a bunch of mediocre journalist who need to make some money.
Forgot about big sisters I hated those things but had to face them to get all That delicious ADAM from The little sisters I remember just dying in one encounter with them but That was Because i run out of ammo üßê
What happened to the recording closet?
I‚Äôve recently started getting into tougher games (cuphead, Celeste, and Hollow Knight) and having no difficulty modifiers (except for Celeste) and although there are infuriating parts (pantheon of Hallownest lol) I feel so accomplished after beating it. Having a set permanent difficulty or having no ‚Äòtension moments‚Äô (like any game with actual ‚Äòblips‚Äô of health instead of a bar) gives the game a more robust feel. However, I do appreciate having certain design elements that allow novice players to enjoy the game themselves at their own leisure. It‚Äôs really up to the developers. Just my thoughts
Sekiro is still harder than teenage morning wood tho...beat it eventually, but still
I figured this out when I was a kid, and depending on the game it would reset its difficulty when you quit the game. So it's kinda sad that you had to make this 'theory' in order for so many people to figure it out...
These SJW want an easy mode in life, now they want an easy mode in our games too.
You are never as good at games as you think you are.  I had a friend who won a major Scrabble tournament.  He thought, with reason, that he was great at the game.  Then, a random acquaintance, who didn‚Äôt play the game seriously, came along and absolutely smashed him repeatedly.  Skill is ego.
Sekiro: Shadows die like way more than twice
Yeah, sometimes games can be so frustrating once you remove the things like coyote time and other ways games make it easier for you
A good example of what's covered In the video happens in borderlands 2, if you have more than a certain % of health enemies can't kill you (their attacks reduce you to about 10% of your health) giving you a chance to find cover, and with certain characters can become almost Unkillable if they can heal rapidly enough
I wish RDR2 had a hardcore mode
I know I'm bad at games.  I've known since 1985 and have 
willingly played easy mode since the early 90's.
Uhhhh hello hello hi I‚Äôm phone guy plesher to meet you Id like to say a few words Freddy‚Äôs friends can be a bit active >:)
Dose that remind you of something
7:32 lol the hearts number
ok but where is petscop
You think this is hard? Try 100%ing Pok√©mon Super Mystery Dungeon .
Matpat can you do a theory on Dead Cells possibly my favourite game, it's pretty cool indie game made by Motion Twin and it's awesome and its got a interesting story if you can work it out, but I really think you should do a theory on it and I think you could at the same time give motion twin a bit of publicity, the publicity that they deserve



(Btw my name is a joke I'm not a furry)
This is why you play minecraft instead...
lol.. funny thing is... given the chance... people would actually pay 4 bucks for a chicken hat
Is it just me or does matpat look 360p this episode?
I mean my stance is simple: these games look incredibly fun but I don't have the patience to deal with that difficult learning curve. Single player games for me aren't about getting "better" they're about power fantasy and having fun and enjoying the story and ambiance. So basically these games aren't for me, so I don't but them. Would I like an easy mode? Hell yes! I would indeed play them if that was a thing. But I'm not going to demand it I'll just play something else
For frick sake this is measaki the lord of hard games
ya forgot mobile games too
14:39 it was thanos
i think whats really hard,is learning the video games mechanics and manipulating it to your advantage,you just got to learn the game.
15:00 I noticed that you promoted GMTK and he is amazing!
So here is an Assist mode done right video, from him were he talks about Celeste's ''Easy mode''
Get new intro
The thumbnail sums up how I feel with these recent videos, like we‚Äôre being babied.
This didn‚Äôt ruin anything for me, I love learning about the amount of thought put into games by designers and developer for you to enjoy the games, because games should be places to escape to after moments of real world stresses.
i play every game  on the hardest difficulty available
In games like ghost recon wildlands when they screen is outlined with red to show your gonna die run! you actually have a lot more health then you think you have
thought this was gonna be a deadlock ngl
episode on fallout series and lore pls
ITS A FAAAAAAAA...
if someone writes a complicated book there is also no easy mode. a game is art, like books (just much more complicated). so if the artist wants his book/game to be filled with difficult words/gamemechanics and wants it to be experienced as such, its only the artists decision.
We've been playing on easy mode our whole lives except if you're my age and remember megaman as a child
I‚Äôm so happy that you‚Äôre in front of the camera now
First time I ever heard of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment was Jurassic Park for the Genesis. Let that sink in...
Matpat proved he's not a real gamer. Cherry picking examples and is trying to lecture us about basic game mechanics.
Just uninstall the game.
I came here to learn...AND BOY DID I LEARN!!!! Thanks MatPat! üòÇ I had thoughts that  the adjustments was a thing. I don't keep up with controversy or anything like that.  Loved this video.  üëç (honestly this was so interesting!)
If you're not able to beat a game because you find it too frustratingly difficult, chances are it wasn't meant for you.
Speaking of difficulty adjusting. Years ago I was playing the original inFamous. I was probably 2/3 through the game when I noticed a tremendous spike in difficulty. More so than the typical last third increase. I checked the settings and the game had auto adjusted to hard mode. It was like the game realized I was breezing through normal with no problems so it got harder!
if there a people say sekiro suck because hard  he is a noob
For the me the harshest ever punishment for "Easy" mode was getting the tragic bad ending in Fatal Frame II for not playing hard mode.
Games are only made with the developers' design in mind, as it should. The market should decide with the buck, not slacktivists, on what is and is not a good business model. Every time I hear people complain about difficulty in a game, it isn't about them just not being good enough at the game...they have to drag in people with physical handicaps as an excuse. And instead of dragging them in to come up with actually useful features for handicapped people (color blind selection, one handed software and hardware, and who knows what else) they just say "Oh just make the game easier", as if people with handicaps are just completely and utterly unable to handle difficult adversity (for goodness sake, one of the best competitive fighting game participants is handicapped in a way that he had to play with his tongue and cheek).


I do not respect anybody who uses the handicapped to get what they want. It is disgusting. Already I don't care about "gatekeeping" nonsense because nowadays everybody is a gatekeeper, much like how everyone today is a nazi or a bigot of some kind. It means nothing. Just let people have their niche titles...they're called niche for a reason, and they help include a section of gaming that isn't made anywhere else. Forcing games that want to be extra hard on getgo into having easy modes gets rid of the niche status of the title, and, if we have to use the word, that would be gatekeeping as it keeps a portion of gamers out of the community and market due to interests alone.
Is this bad though? It would be arbitrary to get the ai to hit the player in an fps the moment they have line of sight and continue until they die. Even a perfect player response would only result in player and ai dying at the same time if they had the same damage. In this sense the ai is heavily nerfed on every actual difficulty setting.
I KNEW IT!!! Allways felt that with enough deaths some attemps become easier than others, just to not save the game an try again tomorrow and pass through at first try
Gamemaker'sToolkit is a great channel!
Did Devil May Cry 3 or Ninja Gaiden Xbox have DDA?  If not, then I beat those games honestly. lol.


Sekiro does have a DDA, it's called being a shinobi.  Fight isn't going your way? Run.  Enemy has two bars? Stealth one of them.


Also, ALL bosses I've played who LOCKED you into an arena were easier than the subbosses who you could run from.
You mean if I would have just continued(in re4) instead of loading my last save the game would have gone easier on me? Dammit, I could have used this info when I was actually playing. Anyway good video.
They should put the health bar thing in fortnite
MatPat: "Your Just Not Good At Games"


Ninja: "What Did You Said To Me You Little S**t!"
i think its not your opinion its you xD
Did this episode even have a theory?
Matpat: Why are you booing me? I'm right.
I know I'm not good at games but I wanna play them because I want to experience the stories, that's it. Let me spend my money in peace, you can still enjoy them on hard mode or whatever
Sekiro: shadows die twice except you die more than two times
eveyrday is a try not to die challenge
The video was about nothing.
Pretty good video, I wish you could make a Difficult Adjusment video but for the opposite effect (AKA making the game harder), because several Android games has this stuff, so they purposely create harder levels/Levels almost impossible to pass without spending money, thus forcing players to spend money.
Basically D.D.A. is Telltale games...
I'm impressed, game designers are smart and I respect that.
I found an odd version of this in gears of war. By turning off the gore the humanoid enemies got tougher to an extent. The boltok pistol would blow there head off with the first shot when gore was on but when it was off they seemed to survive that first headshot.
Damn that‚Äôs so lame to hear I like the ideal of playing a game without hiding nerfs and auto adjusting sliders. I feel if they are going to do this they should at let us turn this crap off especially for players that played for so long. I definitely feel now I have gain NOTHING now. I also hate the buffs for multiplayer in Gears of War I thought at least that  would be fair. It makes me question if all these gamer streamers are getting buff now without them or us knowing?
Do a theory on how to kill an immortal in skyforge or a god
Need a balanced game? Just snap your  fingers and destroy half the gameplay
I'm so glad he gave GMTK/ Mark Brown a shout out cuz he's such an underrated youtuber.
I recently played DS1 & I got 40 hrs on it & im pretty sure I‚Äôm only half way thru! Game is aggravatingly fun
Lol majority of the ones pushing for easy modes are journalists who suck at video games. They need easy mode because they can't complete the game to write their reviews. These are also the same people going to Capcom and asking to make boss fights optional LOL

I don't have anything against easy mode (in fact I often choose the easiest difficulty in games), but From Software games are designed to be difficult from the ground up. Making a "Prepare to die" edition but then having an easy mode in the game would just cheapen the experience.
I thought the DDA system was obvious. I mean even 5 year old me realized I got a random checkpoint or an Aku Aku mask whenever I died frequently in Crash. Perhaps I developed these heightened observational skills due to the age I started playing games at?
Serious Sam two parodied the baby bonnet thing, but instead of easy mode, it was if you played with god mode enabled.
People with anxiety problems do not experience endorphin rush after passing difficult levels, rather, they're more likely to 1)Vent all the pent up frustration. 2)Write a negative review or a nasty post to the developers. 3)Not play it or any game in that genre for several months in fear of experiencing another similar level. This also applies to casual toilet games like Match 3 puzzles.
Matt Patt I am the best gamer. I got a strike in 100 pin bowling on Wii sports resort.
Now imagine that even in these conditions where every game toots your horn on how good you are of a gamer you manage to whine and demand for easy modes. Easy mode for an easy mode? Git good scrub.
Let me guys the earth revolves around the sun because it got gud.
do you want to know why megaman 2 was the best mm game? it was because it was easy!
Sekiro is one of the easiest from software games... if you are complaining that its hard, or harder than bloodborne or dark souls... then you are just bad. All the enemies in the game have almost the exact same attack pattern, and all their moves are very predictable. You just have to parry and counter everything.
I play on Easy mode so I can get a feel for the game (Enemies, controls etc) then I bump it up.
Hate the live action and the type of graphical gimmicks that have come along with it.  Completely killed the entire channel for me, now I can only watch Austin's videos.
Well. That‚Äôs some hard mode truth.

Hi matpat my brother and I were playing Mario kart 8 deluxe yesterday and then we thought of something 

NINTENDOS GAMES ALL TELL ONE STORY: The Nintendo timeline

Our train of thought went down the road of Legend of Zelda leading into mario leading into a modern society  (SUPER MARIO ODESSEY) then after an apocalyptic event splatoon took place and after that the alternate reality that Rosalina created cause crossover games like mario kart (8 specifically because of the dlc) super smash bros

But then we thought where does Pokemon fit in and the we got it when the modern society was formed scientists accidentally released a virus across the world infecting all the animals specifically causing them to develop powers then years later the Pokemon were sick of taking orders from their masters so they rose up and caused the apocalyptic event destroying all the humans giving Cephalopods the chance to kill off all the Pokemon creating splatoon

Anyway that's the theory that my brother and I created based on evidence left by Nintendo and I thought it would be a really good idea for a theory and you'd probably find even more evidence if you did cover it

Hopefully you'll see this
what happened to picture mat. I mean actual mat isn't bad but picture mat is what im use too.
Games with THIS level of challenge and gravitas are very rare. Just let it be

I think it takes a high level of skill and technical intelligence to develop such a difficult game that is also fair and intricately designed
I played sekiro 3 times, quickly realised my gaming skills weren't up to par. However I also didn't want to spend the hours to hone those skills, traded it in for Days Gone. Much more up my street.
What difficulty is GTA?
I would rather choose the difficulty
As a game dev myself, I can honestly say I'd have to make the "normal" mode of my game easier than the actual game has been designed. To develop a game is to play it constantly over and over all day every day for months.  You get good at it. It takes me 10 seconds to beat the first level of my game while others take 2-3 hours.

Hornet: Git gud!
All mortals shall pick a side!!
No... YOUR BEING BABIED!
I noticed that when playing street fighter, on a high difficulty. Once I you get to the last boss, he is nealy unbeatable, but if you try again and again and again... at some point, he starts to act differently and becomes way easier.
Mmmm spicy

easy

So hard mode isn‚Äôt a lie?
Gosh i dont like the new approach to videos and topics :<
Hey you never ruined games for me
It's not a lie. Hard mode does not baby you.


I officially hate you again for further misinformation and encouraging people to to irrationally hate against difficulty options in games.

Sekiro and Soulsborne games aren't superior because they lack options. That's a complete fallacy. Just because you can choose a difficulty, doesn't mean hard mode is a lie. It's legitimately challenging and not babying in games that have such an option. Sekiro doesn't even have adaptive difficulty. Honestly I don't even mind that it doesn't have an easy mode option. I don't even care for this contreversy but outright stating hard mode is fake and denouncing years of game design and innovation is moronic. I can't believe people would agree eith this nonsense. There are so many games with legitimite hard modes that are incredibly creative. Allowing for such an option does not devalue its purpose or difficulty. People have every right to choose difficulty to their preferences as it does have a profound affect on their experiences. Some people can't handle re7 on normal so they play it on easy and enjoy it to its fullest because that experience was right for them. I don't understand why you went all Vaati vidya and decided that hard mode is a failure of game design. That's like saying a game over is a failure of game design.

 It shows how little you actually think about your theories and the topics you address. This doesn't even concern you matpat. You channel is about theorizing. Not using Psuedo intellectual bullshit to prove why your opinion is correct.
Personally?  I have no problem with a game being designed with only a single difficulty mode.  Just becuase you buy a thing doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to use a thing, and the people who design it don't have to ensure you can.
Bike-makers don't have to ensure that only people who know how to ride a bike will buy them.  Video Games don't have to ensure that a player can beat it.
Whether doing so makes them more money?  That's something else entirely, I feel.

if you think FromSoft is just a company that makes Dark Souls and very very HARD AF games, you have no idea that they made Armored Core series, an also VERY difficult game about mecha battles where you can customize your mecha to your content, a series many of us silently waiting in line, for an answer of a new one being revealed.(geddit Armored Core fans?)

you know what's the difference between Dark Souls and Bloodborne and Sekiro with Armored Core? both have very hard enemies after all, they even punish you if you just spam fire your weapons in Armored Core by cutting your income,  so what's the difference? Armored Core bosses aren't just hard because they have some bullshit attack patterns where you must dodge or get OHK by it, no. Armored Core bosses have their fight style, weapon of choice, but you are not limited on how to engage them. if you use a heavily armored and armed mech, you can play to out DPS the boss while maybe sometimes taking some neat maneuvers to evade some of the more heavy damage, or take a highly agile low armored mech loadout with laser blades only and forces all your piloting skills to the max as you try to evade all the shots and strike at the closest ranges where you're potentially going to take damage yourself, or maybe a more tactical unit with missile pods and autocannons with reasonable balance of DPS , armor, and maneuverability.


Does Armored Core have no bullshits? of course it has some. Nine-Ball(one of the hardest enemies in few Armored Core games) can fire 3 grenade shells while moving, while you can't fire grenade shells more than one at a time or while moving. some even said he could develop some degree of resistance to your fav weapons and adjust his movements to your habits. but you are NEVER LIMITED by their movements or attack pattern, you play the way you want to play, you perfect your style of play, you conquer your enemies YOUR WAY. NOT just running and rolling around in circles waiting for that small moment to strike once or twice before repeating it again and again. By the end of the game you'll end up with a mecha that's basically meant for you, every components and setting and visual customization tells your story. You then can go to multiplayer and see how people does their mecha, how one would prefer one type of missiles over another, more mobility or armor, faster rate of fire or more damage. In the end, the game doesn't just force you into a situation. it forces you to make a situation of your own style. the game basically IMPROVES you, not FORCING you to play the game with it's pattern, one hits you to death if you makes a mistake. Sure you can play tanky style but remember you might have issues shooting down a more agile opponent that carries heavy weaponry, while the high speed bladers are probably not suited against a tanky short range mech with lots of dakka, high agility missiles, and more. A more versatile unit might not be suited against more specialized opponents, but that doesn't mean you can't beat them. you just need to fine tune your machine more, develop tactics to overcome them, and execute them flawlessly.

I don't think any game should have easy mode, or that they shouldn't have. But sure as hell I do miss the time when FromSoftware made some VERY difficult games but doesn't limit us to follow the enemy's set patterns as if we're playing some rythm game, instead challenging our skills and tactics, questioning if we really are the best in what we think we are. That's just my two cents.

MatPat, you really should check Armored Core. It was crazy fun.
Another common hidden bonus is increased damage on the last bullet of any clip because it is  very frustrating to get killed while reloading when the mob only need one last bullet.
Are sure that the halo games to this. I've played this game for 10 years, and I realise I really can't tell whether it dumbs down the AI. I don't think it is every game.
All of you should just take it as a joke
D.V.A has entered the chat
Now I know why my noobie friends are always that good in the beginning and then they just get owned. And now I know why in the beginning of a new game I think I found the OP weapon I will use all the time and then I just get constantly owned because the weapon actually sucks. Looking at you Apexs' Mozambique
In one of, if not, my favorite game of all time, Sonic Unleashed, you actually have quick time events.

They went super fast in the first few milliseconds, but would progressively get slower, making the player feel like they JUST made it in the nick of time or making you fell like you have a quick reaction time when‚Ä¶ 
In fact‚Ä¶
You probably had more time than you thought and you just did ok‚Ä¶
Never knew games could be so harsh! Jeered games just because we‚Äôre noobies doesn‚Äôt mean u have to bully us that was a joke it was terrible
8:12 ok, who is actually so bad at AC to actually be reduced to low health?
Easy mode is for 4 years old
The main difference between easy players and hard players isn't their skill. But the fact that easy players don't even WANT to be challenged.
that‚Äôs why epic gamers NEED VERY EASY mode
I love DDA. I'm sorry but I have a LOT of games to catch up on. I don't have the time to "get good". So if I'm playing Dark Souls or Bloodborne and I spend hours dying before I even get to a boss fight then the game is getting dropped. Either for good or when I get caught up on games.  I had to lower the difficulty on Wolfenstein: The New Order and The Old Blood about half way through the story just so I can enjoy the game. So I believe every game needs DDA/A difficulty setting.
doesn't matter...you're still gonna get raped in from software games regardless of how good or bad you play
If Sekiro is to hard then try Dark Souls 2 with only the fist weapon. It is extremely hard since the one boss is hard to hit with that weapon but I did it.
Reminds me when i first ran into this. While playing dark souls 3 i noticed after a while if you killed enough of a specific enemy in a specific spot ( talking like 60+ times) then that enemy would stop spawning... Never ran in to any of this in original ds and now i wonder if something similar was ever implemented there.
I like the idea of dynamic difficulty, but you should be able to turn it on and off.
There is more petscop if you can get on it
Controversial opinion: gamers that don't like easy modes shouldn't play easy modes
Then Minecraft also has DDA?

Matpat, 
If your channel has taught me anything, it's to question the information given to me. You've presented the facts--game developers are making games easier, lying to the player in an effort to, essentially, manipulate them into playing more of their game. So here's my question: is that a bad thing? As a game developer myself, I'm especially interested in the ethics behind this. From the perspective of a hardcore gamer, it's easy to understand why this would be frustrating. However, from the perspective of a game developer, the piece of information that really stood out to me was, "90% of first time players won't play a second match if they don't get themselves a kill." If 90% of players bail on the game, return it, and refund it if they don't succeed on the first round, wouldn't it be logical as a designer to do everything in your power to ensure that the player succeeds? Now, obviously, I'm biased on this argument, being a game dev myself, but I am genuinely curious. A game developer needs to cater to the needs of the casual gamers as much as the hardcore gamers so I'm wondering if there's a balance? A way to challenge (and not lie to) the hardcore gamer, the players who are committed enough to the game to continue even if they struggle and fail, while still catering to the needs of casual gamers who pick up the game on a whim? Is this what the Difficulty Adjustment intended to do? 


Which then makes me wonder about games where the player is designed to fail, games where there is no right answer, no winning, no way to succeed, like the Kobayashi Maru? If you think of video games as being the next form of theater--dance and poetry which evolved into plays, which evolved into movies, which evolved into TV shows, which now have evolved into video games--you could think of a video game, the ones where the player always eventually wins, as being like the fluffy musicals/comedies of Moliere and Shakespeare and Comedia where everything is fun and, even though there are times when all hope seems lost, times of struggle, things always end up happily ever after, the two lovers marry, ect. Is there room in the world of video games for Greek Tragedy where double determination dictates there is no winning? What about a game that unfolds like a Chekov play, where everyone is miserable and nothing really happens and nobody gets what they want, and yet even now, more than 100 years after these plays were written, we still celebrate them? Can the same thing happen with a video game? Will there be a video game that, like Shakespeare, will last for 400 years? Will there be video games that we'll still be playing 1000 years from now? Why doesn't anybody ever make a video game for the sake of ritual? Are video games an art form do you think?

Halo 2 legendary is no joke
I like to play on normal or easier difficulties when playing open world games. I like to explore the world and take my time with things first time around. Then, once I've had my fill, i would crank the difficulty up for the challenge
My humble opinion is that "games should be fun". I like to challenge myself, so I tend to play games on their harder difficulties. Because I find that fun. If the creators of the game are tweaking the game to make the experience I'm after "more fun", then by all means.
Minecraft lied to me that I can get to the end in peaceful
Quick story. I rarely play shooters because I suck at aiming, and if I have to play a shooter it's usually 3rd person (i have 600hrs on warframe). Anyway, I decided to play fortnite for a couple games last year when it was mainstream. I played 3 games in total, and got second in game 2, and first in game 3. I suck at aiming, I always panic in battle royale games, my computer couldn't even run the game at consistent 60 fps... and I won? Hmm...
Sniper Elite 4's increasing levels of bullet physics don't matter if you simply tap space up until and including Hard. At Hardcore it finally takes that away. Too bad too, I liked having a radar but I'm not a big fan of the indicator showing my exact bullet trajectory and I don't feel like using the custom setting. Hard is easy, Hardcore is hard. Atleast for Sniper Elite 4.
Yer damn right. Game theory is on the money here.
I feel like the difficulty of sekiro adds to the overall satisfaction and it definitely makes the game more fun to play. If it were to be a walk in the park it wouldn‚Äôt  required the player to be engaged in the game... in reality you have to practice to get good unlike being good at the game from the get go... an easy mode is a terrible idea
I miss the old animated matpat videos there was a humor and entertainment to those that the live ones don't .. not sure why I can't put my finger on it ü§î

RIP ronnieüíó game theory will never be the same..
Sekiro proves one thing: After 15 years of baby mode in all games except maybe Dark Souls, gamers are so accustomed and trained to have no skill and no will to learn and get better, that a mildly challenging game like Sekiro sends them crying. 

It also reminds me of when Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that games should have some sort of "auto-pilot" mode, where they play themself and people just watch it. Then again, we have that in the form of Let's Plays and their popularity again proves that simply the younger gamer generations suck completely at gaming. Which of course you can also watch in every online game and the things you see the majority of "gamers" do there is beyond absurd and infuriating. 



No, games don't need a easy mode if it doesn't fit the game. Like Dark Souls or Sekiro or any retro-influenced game.
In fnaf when you die you see some static, I see eyes and stuff
Easy mode has only been made a big thing now because they're using the argument of accessible and you're a bad person if you don't make your game accessible. Never mind you can make that argument about everything
greenscreen matpat is pretty cringy
Just leaving a bit of information here on the "Bioshock enemies ALWAYS miss the first shot". That comes from an old dillema, when hitscan weapons became a thing. In the old days, every enemy attack was telegraphed. Be it a sword swing, or a "bullet" in contra, that moves slowly, after the enemy did his "I'm going to shoot" pose.

When games started to implement hitscan weapons, that changed. A hitscan weapon is something that does INSTANT damage, if your're lined up with a shot when the enemy presses the trigger. No warning, no cues, no time to react. It started to feel "cheap" to loose health instantly (after all, AI's can have perfect aim, and hit you every single time).

That's when two new things were birthed: first the "warning shot" that an enemy gives. The "enemies always miss the first shot" shennanigans. The second one, was the automatically regenerating health, CoD style. Devs decided that if  enemies (the game) can take your health instantly, automatically, nothing more fair than making the game also GIVE you health automatically.

Of course there are exception for those in moder games. Some games manage to make enemies "telegraph" hitscan weapons, like a sniper with a laser beam taht only fires after a certain time. And some games, like the Dark Souls series, still count on animation telegraphs.

Aaaaand this became a text wall.

edit1: Please dont take this as a "rant". I freaking love the videos, and he's only human. Or is he....? DUN DUN DUUUUN! Jokes aside, I'm just leaving info here, not going "hurr durr video is wrong".
WERES THE NEW PETTSCOP THEORY they got new ep out..... like so mat pat can see
Who cares... If you don't like the way a game works just turn on the Cheat Engine and be free.
*Sid Meier*: The player doesn't complain about winning too much.
*KH3 Community*: [inhale] WE WANT PAIN!!
I want a hat in time theory plz
Dark Souls II does DDA in a pretty unique way where if you kill an enemy enough times it disappears forever unless you burn a bonfire ascetic which brings them back but they become more powerful. Hm
Dude sekiro is easy i am on playthrough 9 now
only rogue like games can ignore difficulty selection, every other game should let the players choose how hard it is.
I like this new setup, I like seeing matpat smile and stand in front of his content . It makes me smile a bit
Players who are interested in Sekiro are 99 times out of 100 going to be players who have played and beaten at least ONE of the other From Software games; many of those players have played and beaten every single game multiple times. So talking about putting an "Easy Mode," in a From Software game amounts to total disrespect for the player base that helped build this franchise through their loyalty and willingness to share their experiences with others.
Games should be challenging, not frustrating.
The original Super Mario Brothers did this best. If you learn from your mistakes, you can get fairly far. Is it hard? Yes. But that's not a bad thing, because it's not frustrating.
It seems to me whenever people talk about difficulty settings they never consider disability, though I have found it to be especially true about aim assist. because of my disability I need to ENSURE that it is still enjoyable to play, just because I can do something (aim manually for example) doesnt mean it isnt painful and therefore unfun if not entirely unplayable. If I cant pick easy mode/aim assist then I stress about if I even CAN play the game or if I have waisted my money on something because of my disability. So yes I would rather pick my own difficulty and KNOW I can play than have to hope I didnt throw away 50 bucks on a game I wont be able to play
This makes me feel sad
gaming company gets popular for sucking at making controls and claims they just intended for it to be hard.  if your good you can have a hard game with good controls.
So is there any of this in Dark Souls or Sekiro? He mentioned them several times but didn't provide any examples of how From Software games did that.
Matpat: You're not as good as you think you are

Hey Matt loved this video but do you think you guys could play fire emblem path of raidents on gtlive?
I always hate when a game gets way to easy... I almost always played every game on the hardest setting, not because I'm any good, but because I'm stubborn :)
Its a faaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i always noticed this when i was a kid so sometimes i would do my best not to die so it would not get easier
Good thing i play hollow knight
Good episode, dude. I think alot of people already knew about Dynamic Difficulty and that it exists in many games, but I dunno about Sekiro. If anything, i'd say that they removed alot of help on purpose in this particular game. I mean i died like 1000+ times in Sekiro in total (not even a joke, livestreamed the whole thing lol) and the game really didn't feel like it was getting any easier whatsoever. No added bonuses like extra health or more commonly placed items, no extra hits possible to be taken, no easier enemies, etc. Just more of the same. But i think that's what made the game so satisfying when you finally completed the whole thing. Whether it was via the use of glitches but without punched in cheats, or merely playing it the way it was meant to be played, and without either of those, it was still amazingly difficult. The closest thing to D.D. that i'd say was within the game was that all enemies had a very specific set movement and with enough practice, you could memorize it and defeat the game that way. Oh wait... that's pretty significant. 

Ok, you win this round, Matt  Until we meet again!!!
Oh and sekiros attack powerdosent really do much and it sucks cuz the more attack power the more exp you need
This is not about this game but do bildey playtime this is a buly and playtime real names
It's probably save the world
as someone who has completed all the souls games many many times over id be furious if they put an easy mode in the game . it took me a month of practice to kill the  fume knight my first time and getting the fume knight ultra greatsword to use on my strength build was an incredible feeling after dosens of hours of getting my rolls perfect and memorising every one of his moves . I would be a little annoyed after going through all of that just for some noob playing on easy to beat him after a few tries . the suffering and rage and tears is what makes soulsborne games amazing to me.
When you buy anything you are only entitled to what the actuality of what you are purchasing is.  You are never entitled to ignorance.  If you buy a game from Fromsoft, you're buying it knowing it will be difficult.  This is a pointless debate and born out of ignorance.
your wrong
I don't care if I'm bad  at games i play games to have fun

Do you believe that you get better faster when you slowly bump up the difficulty, or go straight to the hardest difficultly and adapt?
you know wut : you are absolutely right!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if the good reviews these better rated games that have had their difficulty lowered are inflated because of that. as in they were easier so more people could clear it so it would flood the numbers with more positive review (and im gonna assume they would be positive because if youve played a game to completion you must not have rated it)
Game developers: consuming your gaming hopes and dreams through an invisible optical illusion.



The truth being known to Matpat, and very WARY gamers.
im torn on this issue. i like having an easy mode because sometimes, i just wanna go through the experience the environment or whatever. but i also enjoy playing difficult games/modes. when i finally get past a certain part of dark souls, i feel really good about myself, even if it isnt a boss fight. whether a game should have an easy mode or not depends on the game. dark souls esque  definitely shouldnt have an easy mode, but not every game is dark souls.
Ugh i hate sekiro i wanted it to stay hard
Can you please do another theory on Splatoon? Please! (Like witch it better, octo or inkling, idk!) WHOS WITH ME.
For me, I'm gonna play on the normal difficulty because that's the way the game was supposed to be experienced. If someone sucks and wants to play with the proverbial bumpers then by all means, it doesn't change my experience in the single player game at all. I honestly have a hard time believing that "casual" gamers are picking up Sekiro or Dark Souls anyway.
*Hardcore mode on Fallout: New Vegas:*
Am I a joke to you?
Everything is a Lie...
Thing is, there is one game that I have found even harder than Darksouls, and it's so much older, back when a difficulty slider didn't even exist: Megaman. I have played a LOT of platformer games, even Megaman Zero 1-4 on easy mode (I wasn't able to beat the bosses on normal, I know I'm bad) an, and I still have yet to encounter a game as difficult as Megaman. Some difficult games like Darksouls at least let you get past the first enemy without much trouble, but Megaman is practically impossible to get past the first enemy without practice or previous experience. Now this is on Iceman's level, and an enemy gets thrown at you right after you start. I went against it and died the first few times, until I eventually was able to kill it, nearly dead, then just to find out that there is another one. Megaman is the hardest game I know and it doesn't have a difficulty slider, Darksouls and this new game can't even compare in difficulty, so the fact that people only now mention it is surprising
It's not a fact it's a theory a game no it's just a fact
Also, I didn‚Äôt see any examples of any of the From Software games using this dynamic difficulty. So are you ASSUMING that all games do this because some games do it? I don‚Äôt even understand what this has to do with the Sekiro debate.
"You dont hear players complaining that they win too much"... Um, may I interest you in KH3's lack of a launch Critical mode?

Almost every single Mobil app I have gives me hundreds of currency and powerful things if I stop playing for months.
It‚Äôs kind of hilarious.
What about adaptive difficulty making things harder? There have to be instances where games automatically ramp up in difficulty if it seems like you're doing really well.
What about Minecraft?
It is all about the Illusion of being powerful and good, and successful. It is always an illusion to feed the self in its most primitive core, whether it is a video game or in real life. Just enjoy the ride as much as you can.
Wait so people actually asked for an Easy Mode? Big Yikes
Left 4 dead had a great system. Improving at that game was great. The better you got, the harder it was. More special enemies, more zombies, less supplies. But it never felt punishing. Each death was the players fault and that allowed me to grow a lot with it.
MatPat is right though,I played every Assassins Creed,EVERY,but..I noticed my "last hit" was my second last hit,even though I was at per se 1 health,in RDR2,the masterpiece,we get aim assist and we get lock on pre firing,tools R* put in for a new players advantage,being someone who played through RDR1 multiple times no aim assist,it felt off,and made me miss more than I hit,this is because I'm used to a harder way of gameplay,so when griefers aim assist with a shotgun,I get mad BECAUSE I GOT A $10 FISH ON THE LINE AND I JUST LOST THAT EXTRA MONEY NEEDED TO GET THE BOLT ACTION BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE COME ON
On a serious note,AC Syndicate is a good example,I'm only level 4,but I easily beat level 10s,11s,you name it,you do more damage,and can be untouchable,and your attacks are so strong and so fast,one would think Thanos could've been stopped by the Frye twins.
The game gives you so much time to attacks.
Call of Duty?AI have a pattern so you can win always,you can even walk up to them behind cover,and you won't be shot,you also have healing and deadly accurate aiming,and they have weaker guns,although they may have the same as yours,but you get a 2x damage multiplier or so,a shot to the head will kill the bot,but not you.
Is this in mincraft too?
I have only playd normal in story but if thare is only normal mode and harde √∞r then i play normal

The only truely hard game was Spongebob: the creature for the krusty krab for Gameboy. But I did beat it
What about when difficulty settings are straight up renamed, like Mega Man 2 had Normal and Difficult where in Japan Rockman 2 just had the Difficult setting, which was just normal to them.
Mk11 is doing this hard
Sorry for the promise breaking of no fnaf but what is Old Man Consequences REAL name
Sorry MatPat if this is a bit inconvenient for the video and you have probes done this theory before but.. Could you do a theory on where in the world Hyrule in BOTW is based? Since this is the most recent vid I thought to post it here. 

I personally think that Hyrule is based in India on the real world map. No, it doesn't look exactly the same but there are a few similarities:

1. A type of currency in India is rupees, just thought this was the obvious..
2. The extreme changes of weather conditions throughout these places have a wide variety.
3. India used to have a monarchy, but it became a republic, so I guess 'fallen King' sorta fits it. Sound like something else in our wonderful gaming world?
4. The diversity. India has a wide ranges of languages and cultures, and so does Hyrule.

Just thought I'd request this.

Thanks MatPat!
A geeky subscriber,
The editing in these recent episodes is just on point. Thanks mat pat
I think getting a DDA checkbox would be great, although players are probably too immature to turn it on themselves.
Perhaps making it on by default but leaving it there in the options, or as an unlockable feature after winning?
Then again, that's just like choosing your difficulty.
Hmmm... As a (almost) game developer, I find it hard to decide, but I wouldn't want to "lie" to my players.


Or perhaps, the reason it sounds unfair is because it doesn't work the other way around: in multiplayer competitive play, as you go up in the rankings, you're faced with (on average) better opponents, so higher difficulty. Keep losing and you're faced with more inexperienced players. 

In singleplayer, the game just becomes easier, does it not?


However, in my opinion, if the DDA is done right, it gives players the feeling of "succeeding after multiple attempts" without making them quit the game because of the difficulty.


But yeah, MatPat is totally right: not everyone is that good at videogames. GIT GUD.
There‚Äôs this mobile game called ‚ÄúCritical ops‚Äù when I first started the game it put me in a match against bots (at the time I didn‚Äôt realize) and then making a second account ount I see some of the things that Matpat talks about.

Remember the gold leaves in that 1 3d mario game on the ds? Definitely dda. I remember dying a bunch of times just for the satisfaction of sweeping levels.
Is it me or does MatPat's new format (appearing in person, more physical humour) seem a bit ... weird? Not bad, just ... weird.
I remember the Batman and Jaws games on the original NES. In both of those games I beat the final boss a few times... and then suddenly I couldn't anymore. I swear to this day they changed and became harder or impossible to beat because it wasn't years or months that passed but days.
Pointing out features that make a game easier doesn't mean its an easy game.
I think something that's been ignored is a difference between fair and easy.


The first shot in Bioshock is a perfect example of something that is there for fairness. An opponent getting an advantage over the player outside of the player's control feels cheap and changes it as Extra Credits put it from challenging to punishing.


Adaptive difficulty is at different beast. More akin to a magician revealing their trick, now something that seemed amazing and special is reduced to something lame.
What happened to deadlock?
If you cannot play a game because it is too hard, git gud. Real talk, the easy mode topic is just journalist shilling for easy mode because they are loose credibility when a challenging game comes out, exposing that they are not gamers but profiteers of gamers. Gamers Rise Up! Your time is now, you have trained for these days, and soon you shall be known as the great hero of the Internet. And therefore... the World.
Am i the only one who misses the matpat cut out from the older game theroies i mean these live action game theroies are amazing but i got so use to that matpat cut out its kinda sentamental
I just remembered a game that used DDA and could negatively affect the players. 
In midnight club LA, whenever you entered a race the game took notice of wether you won or lost. Now, I HATE it when I‚Äôm doing a good race and then a BS car just hits me in the curve for no reason and I restart. But the game doesn‚Äôt take the restart into account. As far as the game is concerned, if you do a hundred races, even if you had to restart each at least 5 times or even 10 times, as long as you don‚Äôt let the race end as a loss, the game would take that as a Victory. So, if your like me and prefer to have a flawless race, and restart until you win, by the end of the game the races are FAR HARDER, cars that were behind you going as fast as they could suddenly got a free nitro, or a slingshot boost, because the game was saying ‚Äúthis guy is awesome let‚Äôs give him a real challenge‚Äù 

It‚Äôs an interesting Mechanic and one I didn‚Äôt know existed. So I say a DDA mechanic has to be tuned extremely well to about something like this happening.

As for the debate on wether there should be an easy mode, my answer is this.
For years I avoided the Souls games because they were difficult, all my friends told me stories about how they would fail at basic combat due to input errors or difficult enemies and little ol‚Äô me didn‚Äôt bother. However, I loved a game called Ratchet DeadLocked, an arena 3rd person shooter that I had a blast. I even played it on the Hardest difficulty. Years later I would finally cave and play darksouls 2, in reality, I say Ratchet DeadLocked at its hardest was harder than DS2. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the first game I had to improve, but when I made it to Darksouls 2 I already knew the flow, except instead of guns I had swords. You can get hit X amount of times Healing is precious and your choice of weapon will affect the fight. I only noticed this recently when I bough deadlocked again for PS3, but the game is brutal on higher difficulties often times killing you in 3 hits even with the largest health pool. I say games like Darksouls have their place, it‚Äôs a Niche not everyone likes, but to say these games should be made easier for a casual audience, I don‚Äôt know. I think it would eat away at that feeling of accomplishment once you beat a game. And while some might argue that it‚Äôs just a game and it doesn‚Äôt matter if you feel accomplished you the end, I‚Äôd argue then why do some people take board games so seriously? Why are you so focused on that chess match, or that game of Monopoly, or that poker game with friends. It‚Äôs because overcoming a challenge is fun, no one likes always losing and always winning gets bored. But it‚Äôs a lot easier to make yourself better and stop losing.
I just play easy mode in games
Cause is fun and satisfying and I won‚Äôt get angry
"we need easy mode" TYPICALL MILLENIALS WANTING EVERYTHING IN EASY MODE, there¬¥s this cool game named FURI where if you choose the easy mode, the game will constantly remind the players they choose the whimpy way xd, and YEAH MILLENIALS because you don¬¥t know the pain of playing PITFALL 1 AND 2 for the NES, or playing Ghouls and Goblins on an arcade machine with only five tokens to complete the game, you know i always felt the SOULS saga as hard as any old school game, i find harder some old games than the new ones in fact, arcade games like the ones i said ? i enjoy them AF but never managed to finish them without a guide or some kind of internet tip, in the old days there was only you, and the whispers of the childs who have lost before you :(, so no easy mode for SEKIRO of course man, and if you are like me, a crazy dude who crank ups the difficulty of the game to max from the start you will notice the "health bar" stuff when you see some friend playing the same game like "wow in medium you can last two more shots before dying ? that¬¥s nice :3", and yeah that "dynamic difficulty" confirmed pretty much what i have seen in some games "from triple A companies usually" when i get to DIE a lot, in some point the game appears to get a lot easier, the bosses  miss their attacks more and more, and then i just restart the game to not feel babysitted xd i always thought this was my idea, now i know i¬¥m not crazy and the game does not read my mind "magically" it read my bad fingers haha
You tried to imply that all of what you argued for most games also applies to sekiro, yet you have not mentioned 1 thing about sekiro that suports your argument, except a few frames showing something like ‚Äúattack power permanently increased.‚Äù This mechanism is visible and avoidable. As for the part where you show vitality being reduced to near death, this is also due to the player upgrading their vitality, otherwise you would die in one shot.
Reeeeeeee
Oh man... i knew about the DDA, but lieing to the player?! Thats disappointing. I want to FEEL the game, not get carried.
And thas way the Dark souls triology are my favorite games.
But that‚Äôs just a comment, a game comment!
Mario also use dda
Anyone ever told you you look like tom holland?
Sekiro isn't harder than Dark Souls 3 it's just a different kind of difficult.
Honestly easy mode is dumb I never pick it like I'm not saying i cruise through games on expert but i like the challenge and I get over it. I think it through and then beat it even if it takes a whole day
Personally this knowledge does not effect me.
And I appreciate game that change a little bit on deaths. I noticed the Assassin's Creed health bar thing. To get to that last bit of health, it only took a few hits, but that little bit itself too a few to kill you. Was quite noticeable.
I don't think it's bad I mean it's still fun right
I don't mind 'can't die unless at 1 health" mechanic, or even '2 second invuln', as long as it's an explicit mechanic that is part of the core game design. Not something that's tacked on afterwards. However, I absolutely HATE dynamic difficulty. Failing against a boss, only to suddenly steam roll him... It can become very obvious when a boss doesn't use a particular move or tactic.
Halo reach on Legendary actually gets a little harder if you die because the Devs don't want you to memorize the encounter. In the beginning of the level where you enter the sabre facility the elite in the drop pod will usually be a blue elite but if you die and retry the encounter the second time it will be a red or higher rank elite. This encourages you to try different strategies instead of the same thing over and over.
MatPat- the truth is your bad at gaming 
Me- welcome to game theory the where we give you the cold hard truth and honestly...
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE COLD HARD TRUTH IT
Yeah if you‚Äôve been playing from the nes days it‚Äôs pretty obvious gamers today are babied. Back in the day we didn‚Äôt have maps, or even sometimes logical progression. The dynamic difficulty thing is nuts:(
Makes sense it's entertainment.
A GAY theoryyy.
So wait your saying that really everyone is bad at gaming ü§£ü§£
Wish halo 2 legendary campaign / LASO campaign adjusted enemy sniperz..
I‚Äôm on the final boss and killed all previous bosses even optional ones even all the headless

Edit:I made a typo you can still trust me
I prefer the old mat pat
What RPGs?


We all know when Final Fantasy IV was released in  North America as Final Fantasy 2 for the SNES, it was nerfed because Square didn't think North American gamers could handle the difficulty Japanese players were accustomed to.


Do modern RPGs have dynamic difficulty?


I was recently playing the Final Fantasy IV remake for the Nintendo DS, and the Computer Core boss in the Giant of Babel insta killed my entire party with a single hit at the start of the battle. Basically it came down to RNG. Was that a terrible attempt at dynamic difficulty? doubt it.


Or When I was playing Final Fantasy VI for the SNES, There was a boss I could not beat in Cyan's nightmare. The save file I had started me right before the fight, with no way to turn back, and no random encounters to level up. I tried and I tried and I could not beat it. I had to go back to a much much earlier point in the game. I would have loved some dynamic difficulty back then.
FIRST OF ALL, I beat Celeste in one ten hour sitting thank you very much.
Dark Souls is headache hard but the game experience when you finally beat the boss the feeling is like nothing else. It lowkey feels like you won a million dollars (for me)
does pokemon weaken when you lose? it always seems easier the second time. could just be imaginary
get gud kid
Sometimes I play crash bandicoot and lose every time in the same place than they give me aku aku but whe
N they do I actually win with out even losing the aku aku mask
Heyy!! Matpat!! Can you please tell Austin to continue the richest video game characters series? I've been waiting from a month
Just wanted to mention thanks for giving recognition to the Super Best Friends Play channel, really shows how far their fan base reaches.
Well, the hardest game I ever beat is Armored Core Last Raven. It warms my heart to see all the "difficult" mainstream games being bashed on by you. Why, because I can't recall in my memory any time where an armored core mission felt easier the second time I tried something. It was more like even if I failed a million times I was still in the same difficulty rut.  I would be curious if you could find any dirt on Armored Core Last Raven.
Seiko is a Amazing game i beat it about 5 times
I'm watching him talk but it's like his voice doesn't link up to his face, he voice is legendary
NO NOMIES WILL UNDER STANDZ (or will i don't know this is a ramdom comment from my thoughts)
Hey matpat can the next theory be portal 1,2?
can you make a theory about mcrees stun grenade?
who gonna start playing in hard mode
Wait I was imagining comments that you find on fortnite videos...
or reinhardts rocket hammer physics
What about MMOs?
Sid Meyer May have never gotten letters saying that people are winning too much. But there are certainly games that fail in this aspect. For example, people complained a lot about Bioshock infinite being too easy compared to earlier installments. Same goes for modern Pok√©mon vs old Pok√©mon. And Matt mentioned the crash series, well I‚Äôm a huge crash fan and Crash twinsanity was sooo easy that I just simply got bored and stopped playing even though some of the concepts were good. I don‚Äôt wanna be an immortal Bandicoot, I wanna feel like I‚Äôm getting better and acquiring new skills.

You really have to strike a proper balance with difficulty. You may not feel dynamic difficulty changes in the same play through but in a series, when you play a new game, you definitely will feel a drop off in difficulty, and if it done too drastically, fans of earlier installments will be lost.
Oh... So It doesn't apply to people with 50 difficulty mods in Skyrim getting one shotted by wolfs during a loading screen, and needing to manually pause the game with console command to even have a chance to react. Oh... and no save game available for restart...
Please, play yume nikki
I thought we were talking about sekiro
Finally someone puts the nail into this old coffin.
That is why I love games that have no freaking Difficulty shards. I don't care for choosing any and I just want to have fun with the game.
Stop making Easy/Normal/Hard and Extreme Modes.


The gaming world doesn't need any. At least that is what I am thinking.
And I like how the devs are helping me little by little as I die along my way. Otherwise games would be frustratingly difficult anyway xD
Hail to those who have beaten Ornstein and Smough on their first try.


Meaning my little sister... Seriously, she's pretty damn good at those games xD
What Happened to deadlock?
Heh... git gud
Thank you for making me realize how bad I am at video games.
I'm not saying that one is better than the other, but I personally like that games are made easier for me without my knowledge.

I work a lot and gaming is how I wind down, so I enjoy having that feeling of triumphing over this level I've died to a bunch of times, and I appreciate that game devs are trying to help everyone enjoy their games (even if it's just so we'll spend money on the next one).
It's also in sports games like Fifa or 2K. The communities of those games call it scrippting!!!
MatPat at the beginning of the video: I'm not gonna take a stance on this topic

MatPat literally 5 seconds later: lol git gud scrub
Touhou be like:

HAAA?? EASY MODO??
I think a good example of this is the Kingdom Hearts series. It really makes you feel powerful whether you‚Äôre good or bad at the game
How do you get carried away by a mob of angry people with deadly weapons while standing in the same position.
You're not picking a side? 



YOU'RE NOT PICKING  SIDE!?!



Face it man, even when you're neutral, you'll still be on the wrong side.
I"m really liking this new format
I still think that bad players should git gud, but interesting video MatPat
What are the games without dynamic difficulty?
Eh yeah everyone knows SOME games have stealth nerfs to difficulty but there are certain games that don't do that. They usually only have 1 difficulty.
D.D.A : " Perfectly Balanced...as all things should be."
I remember when I used go play halo 2 on legendary, and basically I'd die many times per checkpoint

And since I died so much I'd know exactly what to expect and how many waves of enemies come. After dying a million times I would only succeed because for some reason a wave wouldn't spawn where it spawned every single time before. And now I think I know why
That camera movement from the Superman game is Murakami Teruaki levels of disorienting.
...
You all know what to do.
Boarderlands gives you Ammo and if you keep dying they give you  the character ability lol
Please, please, PLEASE! Make a new video on Petscop!!!
Harder game
Better Gain
That headline. "an easy mode has never ruined a game". Tell that to kingdom hearts 3.
I've always had a habit of memorizing enemy numbers and weapons and I noticed that in certain games the numbers or load-outs would change after death. I thought it was just randomization, but it makes more sense that it was DDA.
You notice it in Crash. Once you hit a level you just canNOT get past, you see all the ways they help you.
And then you have MGSV, where enemies start gearing up based on the tactics you use.
...

The games were designed to be difficult. Like, that‚Äôs their intent.
If you aren‚Äôt prepared for that, for a game with tasks and gameplay harder than the average game you‚Äôre used to playing, then don‚Äôt buy it. Or be prepared to trade it in for something else. Better yet, try it out at your friend‚Äôs first or something.
Hard games don‚Äôt need an easy mode when they‚Äôre designed to be hard. Unless the developer really wants you to play through the whole game, you shouldn‚Äôt expect one, either.
I stopped watching your videos for a couple of years now, but this was really good. The more you become educational the better you'll be. Citing game developpers like this... it was great pat! A long way from the meme your videos became at some point
rather then games getting easier
ied rather start the game on easy and then by the end of it be on the hardest
make it feel it getting exponentially harder
Beg to differ: all souls games, nioh, bloodborne and the like are easy given you can outlevel everything in the game that trivializes all combat. (except I can't vouch for DS3 since I've not played it). Also, in Nioh I'm one one shot trick pony Ninja - Shuriken and Kunai obliteration (ok two trick pony), but dies to anything on one hit IF the enemy even can hit me.

Good ol' Golden Axe and Streets of Rage 3 hid their real endings behind harder modes.
I thought something was odd with King of Fighters XIV. I played it, beat the boss. After that I tried it with cheat (a trainer), just messing around. Half way despite the fact my health couldn't drop, the game was harder. It took longer to get through to the boss.
Ultimately...I think playing on easy mode or hard mode is fine. At the end of the day, games are just supposed to be fun, and sometimes...you need easy mode to learn how to get good at hard mode.

And I'm not against D.D.A. in of itself, but I really wish more games would give players the option instead of forcing it on us without us being aware...but then we wouldn't feel as successful which wouldn't be as solid of marketing for the developer.
Hands down one of your best videos mat!!!!!!!
I miss the old mat pat edits. Where they were terribly photoshopped and they just added to comedy. Good video still
Check out an older version of this by the channel extra credits. Look up extra credits hidden game mechanics.
The difficulty slider can't catch me if I don't suck at games to begin with.
production value through the roof
Easy mode is the reason Japan doesnt respect us now and we cant get the good games from them üòî
Woow I didn't know there was  this much to games
My life is hard mode
Do a apex legends theory
I‚Äôm going to try video games again , yay! The games from the 80s were super hard so I dropped it. Good to know they adjust for my ineptitude ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Just get to the point man!
When you get to 15 million subs for the subscriber special you should remaster some of your oldest videos.     Or just remaster some of your old videos at anytime.
Could you do a MK11 theory? Like what could potentially happen next, since Interviews confirm that this isn‚Äôt the last game
I beat the game about 75%. Need to get one more ending before it is 100%
0:55 it's not a fact

It's a  T H E O R Y
Hey how does fusion personas in persona 5 work
video games are art, dark souls is art that is supposed to make you depressed.
Ain't nobody got time for this!!!
Look at the pro list
good video but all the points you made on DDA were about other video games, and not one thing you said would lead me to believe that sekiro also has this same game mechanic, its fun to assume it may, but it might not, nobody will really know unless FromSoft says it themselves, and because they haven't said anything about this for any soulsborne games, im going to believe that the DDA system is not in sekiro. 

i love u matpat
Idk if he/she can be considered a DDA but how can we forget the A.I. director from Left 4 Dead? It tried to make every playthrough different while adjusting item spawns and horde spawns with the pace and how well the players were doing.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not good at games‚Äù 

entire hardcore gaming community REEEEEEEE
Someone please show me where Halo legendary difficulty did this because there were some hard missions to do solo
I think I have a pretty healthy understanding of how good at games I am, I suck quite a bit. The only games I ever did well in was bungie games, and I don't know why
Will someone please explain to me how Thanos broke Captain America's shield without The Infinity Gauntlet
I just beat sekiro tonight.  It was fun, it was hard.  The moment I killed the final boss I let out a shout of joy which caused my wife to say "finally beat that guy you've been fighting for a week?"  Yes, I fought him for 7 straight days.  7 days of die, run back, wreck the first two phases, maybe get through the third, die, repeat.  That's not good game design.  About 3 hours of that would have been more than enough.


I absolutely believe that dark souls has dynamic difficulty adjustment.  I know this because a boss like the nameless king would wreck my stuff all day long, to the point where I couldn't get 3 hits on him.  Then, one match everything would break my way and I'd win.  My dark souls purist git gud friend swears that I got gud and beat him, but I know it was easier than the 10 times before.  I do not believe that sekiro has this system in place.  No boss in dark souls took me more than 10 tries.  In sekiro 20-30 tries were normal for things like lady butterfly, the demon of hatred, any headless, that stupid spear mini boss.  God knows how many runs I took at the final boss.  i wish it kept a stat, it has to be over 100.  I have 71 hours played in NG, 20-30 of those hours have to be the final boss.  5-10 are probably lady butterfly.  Probably 5 hours on the demon of hatred.


When I beat him, it was because I got gud, and the rush of hitting that final execution was fantastic, but it became a chore instead of fun, and I considered downloading the speed cheat more than once, but was dead set on winning fair, even in a grossly unfair fight.
Huh, this is what game theory has become
Do a theory on ARK
So pets cop is at 21 will we get another pets cop video
Nooobbbbsss
The curtain rises, the veil has been lifted and now gaming has been ruined for me.
Thats why i die in fortnite :"v
who the hell cares? the main point of a game is to, beyond telling a story, is to have fun, if the tension makes it feel more enjoyable and fun, then it's ur fault if u still get mad cuz u are getting angry over something that barely matters if at all
Hay mat pat remember the episode where you said sonic was slow check the live action move that is going to happen
1923:in the future people will finally stop making these types of comments. 

2069:people in 1959 said we'd have flying cars......
When they say it needs an easy mode but the first play through is the easy modeü§£ü§£
Wisecrack made a great video on this topic too.
Totally unrelated but is it just me or MatPat can be an good Batman Riddler? He got the looks and the attitude hahaha
hey do you think you could do a theory on how much force you would have to use to break metal in fortnite? just wondering thx
Talking about sekiro shadows die twice, put a god of war thumbnail
Nice video matty. As always. New perspectives are always welcomed.
Why did I get another notification about this video on my phone after I already watched it?!
Just "git gud"
Wait a second, that last example was about a multi player game?
All is well and good in single player games to give the player a better experience, but this is a huge NONO if you secretly make one player better than another when they are fighting against each other.
my brother says sekiro is hard but he's used to it (he played dark souls tonnes of times and bloodbourne so he rages just a little)
Deadass... I thought everyone knew about this in games, I noticed it when I played as a kid it just makes sense
there is a new petscop I'm trying to figure it out And then I'm being babied now..
2:29 you gave away your preference with your shirt. Don't tell me it wasn't intentional. For all of those afraid to take the red pill...
Ya i beat Ninja Gaiden black on master ninja so i think i am as good as i think thanks :)

i dont really like matts new format at all
you can change the difficulty  at any point in dante's inferno and skyrim
This is one of my favorite videos! What an eye-opener... thanks!
Wait a second, is the smoke and mirrors reference to A.I. in games or just a phrase you used? I have a theory...
12:03 perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
con theory about how can cap on end game can hold thor hamer
What About Halo on legendary? Explain why you get killed by the same grunt with the Fuel Rod Cannon over and over again....
Every time I notice a game is going easier on me after dying a few times I actually get quite upset. I've been denied the opportunity to overcome my obstacles. In some cases though when I know it'll happen I just get killed a few times to make it happen, in those cases I'd have just preferred it was that way in the first place.
I understand most people low key appreciate it, whether they realize it or not, but like many things, I wish it was an option.
this video is great, but can I have a happy birthday for me please?
Speaking of games adjusting difficulty while you play, I've noticed the overall difficulty dropping in games. I first noticed this in the Call of Duty games. I would play Black Ops 2, slap it on Veteran, play it. Then I would play Black Ops 1, slap it on Veteran, and it would be exponentially more difficult. I later confirmed this with Black Ops 3, repeating the same process at a friend's house as well on other Call of Duty games.
Maybe other games do this, but I haven't played too much of any other series to confirm yet.
what does that say about ppl who still cant beat those games after repeated attempts.
DDA ruining Online game...
Honestly, this is why I start  by playing the game on normal mode until people watching me play have no idea what's happening since I'm doing things so fast, then restart the game on hard mode to actually play the game for the game, instead of practice.
Any one else notice that he fails to give any examples of a game that forces/openly encourages harder game play also adjusting it's difficult in any way. The closest he gets is Doom, but even then he's talking about the original from 1993 and the reboot from 2016.
Y‚Äôall should do a theory on why Forza Horizon 4 sucks so much and why they refuse to fix the actual issues that plagued us since the release of the game and instead fixed smaller issues no one experienced on a regular basis.
Personally, as someone that plays hard modes of games that I like, I prefer games that don't artificially gate their content, at all.

You figure most games cost between $60-$80 these days, almost all of them have paid DLC, paid-expansions, and various paid early-access passes, as well as the dreaded "season passes" that are all the rage from money-grubbing game companies these days.  If I'm expected to drop that much money, I expect some settings for just being allowed to play the game straight through, regardless of difficulty.  If I want to play on easy, I will.  If I want to play a more challenging mode or personally challenge myself through some sort of self-made challenge, then I'll do that too.  Having the developers intentionally cut content to artificially extend the life of their games is just disingenuous to the consumers.
I'm an easy mode gamer bc I have terrible gamer skills and enjoy story. A lot if those misleading mechanics are honestly super cool! But as a bad gamer, I die to incredibly stupid things. I don't want those stupid things to be somehow easier.
My favorite form of dda is in Minecraft when you die and there are no monsters nearby to so you can get items back

Fortnite's aim assist is better on certain platforms. It's best on Mobile, second best on Switch, and worst on PC I believe
You should make a comic/book theorists plz
bruh sekiro is more fun than hard the people who find it hard/impossible they brobably didnt get the tase of satisfaction in beating bosses in this game or any other Dark Souls game
Mattpat can you please make a thoery about presentable theory
People always seem to forget that From Software's old property Armored Core was pretty difficult too, rarely had an easy mode though the AI goes from godlike to "Help, I'm forever jetpacking into the wall!".
Matpat does his opening
"Ok that sounds kind of stupid, i bet that's not actually what he means but just a clickbait opener."
5 minutes into the video
"Yep i was right."
I get that Sekiro is a great way for you to talk about D.D.A but why is Sekiro just a footnote in this conversation. There is little to no D.D.A in Sekiro with only minor tweaks in item spawns I guess. Every enemy has a set placement, no enemies gets reduced, Every enemy has a set program of actions, damage has a set value. None of things you talked about has any relevance to Sekiro.
Make a theory about disc 11 and 12 mat pat plz like this
Have you ever considered doing a video on bully, for example what year its set in or if James Earl Cash the protagonist of manhunt and Jimmy Hopkins the protagonist of bully are the same person.
Sekiro is easy. There no giant dads or dark beads
Seriously...peeps like things spoon fed to them. I'm on an eternal search for games that have something new/different/an actual challenge. Not to toot my own horn I just play on normal or hard for a first playthrough ie like a challenge. 
So had been playing other systems for a looooooong time then got back into Nintendo titles (Donkey Kong Country returns is like Monkey-paw Slapsgiving) and Indie titles, mostly on computer. My bad for not getting into computer gaming earlier lol challenges and good games abound! I think I find most (mainly xbox) titles easy is because I was raised Nintendo, and they've got a history of being game-b*tchslaps

So anyway I don't think easy mode is necessary.....mostly because a lot of the titles are already too easy. Gotta love a game that adapts due to how good you are. (Unless you're farming Achievements and don't want a hassle) 
- From Someone who stopped playing/wanting an Easy Mode since 1994
I think there is nothing better than beating a game on hard mode or finally beating a boss after you 50th try
if sekiro is too hard and you dont like it just play EVERY OTHER GAME...let us have one that has some difficulty.


Edit: great video btw.
Then what do you call dark souls' reducing health bar  dynamic difficulty on revenge mode????
I'm not as good as I think I am?  Well, then, I'm negative.

Edit: I'm a game dev, I'm still 0, fortunately.
Well especially with earlier games, difficulty levels were often just a means to offer some form of replayability for linear titles. A new goal for a player to aim for after already taking part in the main experience. Although some of this has since worn off with games now offering new means for a player to create their own difficulty, particular in more open world games or strategy games where other variables can be tweaked.

As for the discussion of games difficulty as gate keeping. I do agree that the option for an easier experience is not necessarily an unreasonable one (that's why we had cheats back in the day), and so long as it does not come at the expense of the market that wants more challenging games then their isn't really that much of an issue.

In fact let's just bring back cheat menus, let the people who want to toggle with the games inner workings to allow them to play the game how they want too. Whether if that is to make it harder or easier.
Not as good as I think I am? I‚Äôll have you know I got 3 stars on every cup in Mario Kart 8, including 200cc

i suck at everything else tho :(
I think dynamic difficulty is a really cool trick developers use to make games engaging. Thanks for the awesome videos Matt!
AND I DID IT TO THE END HARD MODE BABY
Matpat: you're not as good at gaming as you think

Me: well I already knew I'm trash, how much trashier can it get?
Just saying, the hardest boss I‚Äôve fought in quite a while was the Queen Valkyrie in GOW.
So, Mat. I'm simply curious. You had a ton of examples of DDA, but any specifically for FromSoftware games? Specifically anything from Dark Souls 1 and newer?
can we do a petition to bring back edited Matpatt
thats y frighting game is better .cause if you want to win you have to keep giting gud
Life has no easy mode.
Pls tell me sekiro does not do this
Dude im really good  at god of war 3
so this is why Hanzo mains hit their targets
First of, i really like your videos, i've watched almost all of them and liked all of them so far, but here, i disagree.
I know what you're saying is true, because i'm currently studying video-games in order to become a game dev. But i don't see how what you're saying is a bad thing, you're talking about this difficulty matter as a bad thing. But usually it's not made lightly, devs don't use it because they feel like it, they use it for they're audience's "pleasure".
Most people that create games do it for the experience the player is going to experience. The devs make fun of easier difficulties so the player will feel compel to try harder modes, and not just to say "haha you're a loser bitch", and it doesn't apply to all games, they do it for specific games, targeting specific audiences. 
And exactly as you said it, it feels good to succeed at a higher difficulty and have new parts of the story unlocked, because you do get better, maybe not as good as you think, but you still learn from your mistakes, but hitting a wall over and over again is not fun, it messes up your experience, so devs make sure you can get passed it and learn from it, even if it means cracking it a little bit or showing you how to hit it. And to continue with the DDA, sure, once you know it, you feel betrayed, for a little while, but if they didn't use DDA, the game would be unfair and most players wouldn't enjoy their time playing. Everything devs do, is to ensure a better moment playing the game, challenging players, making them exited to think about playing the game, not to just shatter player's dreams by telling them they're bad and will never be able to succeed at their games.
I'm sorry for saying all those maybe vexing things, but what you're saying is mean just to be mean and making people feel betrayed even more then they should, it's making people mad over something that isn't a big deal at all.
sorry matpat, i usually enjoy your videos.
I just want another Armored Core.
Please.
Please From Software.
I need my mechs again.
8:34 you forgot to mention that the enemies aren't allowed to fight you all at once.. they actually have to queue up X3
(though the really big badies get to skip ahead in the line)
Why don't they just make it an option: static/dynamic difficulty.
I wonder if there would still be such modern disdain for difficulty levels if all those early game did not stigmatize the easy modes?
Bring back animated matpat
I was playing Mortal Kombat x, i NEVER died more than 3 times, each time i died the IA becomes easier, i was a bit Sad when o discorvered.
Do a hollow knight
Celeste is a game that does this really well.  There is a medium level of difficulty to finish the game and way harder challenges that are optional.  It also allows for advanced movement that is much faster and works well for speedrunners.
I feel Dynamic Difficulty is smart. Oh you're doing poorly? Heres a little nudge. Oh you're doing fantastic? The boss has a bit more health.
DDA EXISTS
In Offline Mode:Yeah Sure Its ok
In Online Mode:Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Why don't you do a thory about how demon souls dark souls and bloodborne are in the same universe and timeline use the moon light sword since is in almost all of the games.
Hey, can you do more science theories? With sciency stuff, you know?
the post at the end is pretty accurate, just not on the sekiro easy mode, but on games in general... hollow victory.... nothing is risked, nothing is gained... sad that we dont know the difference...
Shooter games *Playing on hard mode - Just gives the AI aim bot
D.D.A should be optional in a game and no game needs an easy mode, D.D.A on or off should be all you need. Maybe a hard and hell mode besides normal difficulty.
Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment also existed in Street Fighter III everytime players got defeated several times by the final boss.
cranky's advice
Something something Flow Theory is better.
get out of here with that greenscreen go back to edited matpat
Who knew of the concept "Hidden Mechanics" from Extra Credits before seeing this? That video they made was released YEARS before the controversy, so it's really not that new to know that games give you the benefit.

Hell, most later Kirby games I noticed kill the boss when they still have like a small amount left (look at Star Dream's fight for the most clearest example; every phase dies when the boss looks like it can take another 5 or so projectiles).
I like being able to choose my difficulty. Medium or hard mode, sometimes extra hard mode if I really like the game.
"You arent as good at games as you think you are"
Me: i didnt think it was possible to be that bad at games
Maybe I'm just stupid, but what was the point?
I don't mean this as a joke, or a slight against Matt, but what actually was the point of this video?

That games have Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment, and that means... We shouldn't say get good?
Take the difficulty from dark souls or cuphead, they're no longer dark souls and cuphead
Easy mode in dark souls is called summoning your friends who have no life and have done no death runs while 110% encumbered and a broken straight sword.
DDA is cool and all but still missing the point: Sekiro and Soulslike games are about learning and then performing. Some can do it patiently and some just choose the try and error route. Guess who'll be more frustated. Guess who'll demand an easy mode. The objective is not to finish the game in one sitting... but to take the time to master it.
I knew something was fishy in all those bosses I lost to.
god i dont think dynamic difficuty is a good thing unless its only on easy and normal anything else like hard insane critical should not have the dynamic difficulty
But hey, that's just a fact...
Who misses edited matpat? 
‚úãI am üòîüòî
I wouldn't say Sekiro is too difficult. But it does require you to keep trying and once you beat a boss you were stuck on for two days, you're like "oh.. That wasnt that hard"
Almost like the boss gets easier every time you try...
So it wasn't just me going I should not have made it
#fortniteeasymode
when I suck at a game I just look for help with what I need help with.
I think all games should have a hard mode in mind with DDA built into the hard mode. like. if you die too many times at the end of a long level it will give you a closer spawn point. by that point you have already did that part of the level enough times. or by design the game should have a spawn check point before ALL boss fights to avoid having to re do an entire level.

other minor help might be allowing a vendor to have more hp potions if you die a lot. the merchant would simply be tailoring their inventory to items that are more likely to sell. supply and demand.
Is a game fact, a gaammee ffaacctt. Thanks for watching.
0:48 like funking honestly
This isn't a thing. People have been playing games this way for as long as we've been playing games; at least since Kriegsspiel.

I'm a dungeon master, have been for thirty years. I lie to my players CONSTANTLY. Every DM does. We are constantly either tweaking difficulty, balancing difficulty, rigging monster behavior, or outright lying about dice rolls.  Yes, even back in first edition. If we didn't, then we wouldn't have many repeat players and most people wouldn't have a good time. 

Occasionally, with an experienced group that knows a game system the DM will play without a screen, fight without mercy, and without 'balanced' encounters. These games are notorious, and the people who play them bring replacement characters. The world is inherently unfair if played realistically.  Most players just want to have fun, and that's really what I want to see too. If thirty years behind the screen has taught me anything, it's that the vast majority of players don't really want to see how their sausage is made. They are there to be lied to, whether they know it or not; there is no dragon. It's just about the experience.

Should there be an option to turn DDA off, is it worth the extra code? eh. resounding eh. 

As long as I'm having fun I don't care.
as I get frustrated for losing so many times I just leave the game and come back when cooled off to work at it again.
This backend dynamic adjustment does not fit rpg games, especially if it tries to hide it. rpg's should be providing enough information to the player for them to make decisions about whether the difficulty fits them in their current state. Soulsbourne games do incorporate these adjustments but not in a way that changes things that you would expect to be constant, i.e. enemy placement. It's done through subtle opening of different options or suggestions. rpg's should give you the tools to create your difficulty, whether it's through a variety of items, available playstyles or outright different paths, which all soulsbourne games do exceptionally. So really I'm saying no to easy mode, because if a player doesn't have the will or time to get serious and care for the created games as experiences, then they should know that they're playing a very different game than intended by the creators, which will probably not be very fun or memorable, easy mode or not. If it makes the people who never cared about what game they were playing to be discouraged, then I think gatekeeping becomes fine at some point.
Dark souls 2 non boss enemies not respawning after a while could be seen as a form of dda.
Very epic but how about a theory on the true nature of SCP-001
I know I suck at games don't need to rub it in
I feel like dynamic difficulty should be an option in settings, but not forced
I like the Souls games, but I am tired of the toxic "git gud" attitude of many players. It's condescending and hypocritical.
How about we remove adjusted difficulty, remove hard/easy modes, and just have a game that is the same for every single player?  Feeling like the game is letting me win/making my life harder on purpose without letting me know is a huuuge turn off. I don't want to have a harder time just because I'm good at the game. I don't want an easier time just because I'm currently bad at the game. I want to be treated the same exact way of other players. I don't like this concept of adjusted difficulty at all, it feels like one more artificial thing placing a veil on games. I don't care if they use it for marketing purposes so that more people keep on playing games. I want a better experience. Big oof
I don't understand why people have problems with an easy mode in the game
G i t  g u d
Not good at games?!
My 100% completion for Enter the Gungeon says otherwise
Don't forget some of those old games also had cheat codes and save slots to let you work around "impossible" parts
Play an MMO and watch players beat its hardest content with half your gear and time, that's the best measure of how good a player you are.
G I T G U D
the uh... first 6 minutes and 30 seconds weren't really necessary? not sure, just not really what i was expecting for this channel
otherwise, cool video with stuff i didn't know about before!
I think you just ruined days gone for me
...im outraged.
So everyone needs do perma death so they dont get DDA
Soo you telling me Minecraft hardcore mode isn't actually hardcore...BS!
I respect game developers who make normal difficulty and then only increase. With normal being their main focus for enjoyment and perhaps that could even have hidden dynamic adjustments. Harder difficulties shouldn't have dynamic adjustments. I also respect when the harder difficulties are more unique than just "taking more damage" or "having less drops" or whatever. I think harder difficulties should have more effort put into them. For instance, a route is blocked in a harder difficulty and another route appears which "expands" the game a bit.

Just because a game makes an experience more streamlined through dynamic difficulty does not mean that gamers don't learn or improve. RE4 is a great example. It felt very hard on my first playthrough but felt much easier on subsequent playthroughs. If my performance was worse (more deaths, longer times) when the game was easier, and my performance was better (fewer deaths, faster times) when the game was harder, I must have improved. I had fun every time I played it, and I'm sure I'll play it again. From an educator's perspective, extended, enjoyable practice with scaling difficulty leading to performance improvement is an ideal situation.

Mattew your videos and your edits guys are awesome i love them and everyone does <3
I play games not to get gud but to feel powerful or to escape my worthless life so for me its easy mode or I don't play lol I don't even try normal not because I don't think I can win but because its more fun to go riping through lvls like a blender on high tanking hit with a shrug and dishing out one hit kills

I have a theory:

Guys you just have to ring the bell at Senpou temple and the game becomes easier. I'm serious. Give it a try.
Single players are designed to be beaten. You will always win if you just play it.
Hey, I know this is has nothing to do with the video, but could you please do a video on the game Oneshot? Thanks!
I don't know if this format for the videos is new, but I really liked it!
I just want a DDA slider as well as a difficulty slider
So as much as the idea of Dynamic Difficulty sounds nice, when I play a game from From Software, I'd like it to be one standard difficulty. This is what gets the souls borne community so united, because each player experienced the exact same difficult bosses, and had to overcome it. DDA might be good in some games, and maybe I'm in the minority, but I wouldn't like to see it in Sekiro or any other From Software games.
Can you change the intro
I miss deadlock
But I think I suck at games. If I am worse then I think I am :,(
I usually don't like to be that guy, but a heavily padded 18 minute video to describe to us what dynamic difficulty is? I'm pretty sure most of us knew that it's been a thing for a while now, and even though I like the souls games and their difficulty, dynamic difficulty is just something I don't care about. Sure, if it's in a game, fine! If not, OK! The discussion of difficulty has become I feel redundant at this point, and as long as we're having fun, it doesn't matter.


I haven't watched a game theory in a long time, probably since high school, but I feel very cynical about this channel. I know you feed into "the youtube algorithm" and you even joke about it, but something about the identity of this channel has been lost. I remember back when I would watch a younger MatPat show me interesting science in a brief but entertaining and informative way. Mat, if you're reading this, no hard feelings, but I think something needs to be done.
Unless you play moba genres.
Can't believe I just got called out like that within the first minute of the video
Minecraft
I don‚Äôt really care, as long as everyone has a good time. But good to know matpat, thanks.
I play on permadeath so yeah one death I restart so okay im at least pretty good i think
The developer makes the game. You chose to buy it. I didn‚Äôt fiendish dark souls 2 cause I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Sekiro I love the game. It being hard just makes it better
I have theory request. Are all danganronpa executions fatal? since not many people are interested in danganronpa, this could be a mini theory. It doesn't sound too hard, but what do I know?
Good bye my remaining confidence. I‚Äôll never forget you
But Sekiro does have an easy mode. The game literally lets you die for free and revive to get a free stealth attack on enemies.

And Demon's Souls also has dynamic difficulty tuning. When you die it cuts your health in half and shifts the world tendency toward black. Continued deaths shift the world tendency further and start spawning black phantoms.
it wasn't supposed to every time you died you learn something new
if the enemies get easier you aran't learning anything




Sorry about my english I'm brazilian
You should do a theory on Little Nightmares!
If anyone knows the pain of Ocarina of Time MasterQuest (on 3DS) please comment and we'll suffer together
This explains a lot since when I was at friends or aquantince‚Äôs house my experience was so much easier then when I went back home my play-style was pushing the adjustment to favor a lot harder due to the game scaling for me made every action I did vital. This makes it so much sense and I thought this was a thing and to have it confirmed is nice
And then there's FTL.

me, casually dismissing the prompt to turn on hardcore mode for fallout nv: we been knew sis
I knew this was in some games, but not in that many! (PS I love your channel!)
Interesting video for fans of crash or bioshock, but you didn't actually say anything about dark souls or sekiro. You missed the point of these games entirely. While you were careful not to actually say it, you did seem to imply that From Software games use this dynamic difficulty adjustment, which is really unfair. As far as I am aware dark souls and sekiro do not use a system like that. In fact, they stand out for the amount of control they give to the players to set the difficulty of their own game. Anyone interested in actual game design, this video explains it way better: 
One of the developers of Warframe, Steve Sinclair, talks about the "Hollywood shot" This means that the first shot misses you... so its like the move. He continues to say, "...our  game doesnt have that."
Gamer over game.
Seems like in this case, easy mode is not needed.

Without me saying you already know the movie I am talking about
As someone who is bad at games, I honestly love the dynamic difficulty adjustments.
Okay, but dark souls gets away with certain mechanics and glitches that for any other franchise or game label it unplayable
asdasdasdasdasda
Dynamic Difficulty needs to be made optional.
Easy mode shouldn‚Äôt exist!
Edit: wait you guys are just now learning of DDA? I‚Äôm not out of high school and I‚Äôve been using DDA for years
I just generally don‚Äôt like a game like dark souls. Too many things going on, and honestly not too interesting in overall gameplay. I did actually finish the game and everything as it was sorta a bucket list thing, but to my dissatisfaction.
Essentially when a DM fudges a roll
If you think everyone is at the same 
Level as the top tier gamers your perception is flawed. A product meant to sell, to pay the makers... You need a wider funnel of fans. If your developing a game having a full game in average. I depth special gifts for hard mode and a glazed over easy mode where you can watch the story... With an interactive flow. But its more like a movie not a gamer experience. Think kids and people with other parts of their lives taking up a higher percentage of their time. They can talk story w gamers but cant speak details of strategic and secret parts...
COME ON I LIKE THE ARGUMENT EPISODES
I dont mind games being hard, but borderlands has good difficulty settings
There is nothing morally wrong about a game being very hard without having an easy mode, but I have to think that is probably not a sound business practice.
How is that high drama? It's just good game design. I've noticed it in games before when I've died and it was easier.
Matpat: ur not good at games

Me: dies in csgo vc
I hate when the game makes it easier on me. I want to become better, not let the game lower the bar for me.
It's kinda like how when you do chase missions in a game and you can't catch them in time so they either hit a dead end or crash

I want an easy mode for sekiro so the devs will stop nurfing bosses because babaies cant kill them
No way of getting better at a game if that itself makes it easier for me. Let me select my difficulty, don't tweak it for me
I would want the real hard mode
Sekiro is harder because there is no online, so no one can carry bad players.
Online was the easy mode (summons), and a balance attempt by adding invasions.
New idea, probably. Who is faster: Sonic or The Flash. If it's a 2 parter  you can do half here and the other half on film theory.
I love games having no difficulty settings. Its like an uncut movie.

I played all Fromsoftware  games. In my opinion DS2 is my personal best game ever. 
Sekiro is a good game but its worse than the DS series for many reason (but not for being too hard. Rather feeling you take damage while not deserving it way too much. That could be because the game lags badly for me maybe).
RE 4 is my favorite game of all time, and you notice those missing enemies if you play through it 1200 times. my best run, though, was on professional with zero deaths (well, 1 death because i always shoot the water for fun) and took barely any damage so yay for keeping my pride intact.

I was a little disappointed to hear about Dynamic Difficulty adjustment in games but the more I heard the more it makes sense. As a Dungeon Master for Dungeons and Dragons, I have been doing the exact same thing. Even after telling my players  do this, they still notice in the moment. Adjusting difficulty is a great way to ensure we feel challenged but still have a good time. I am all for it.
Honestly, I don't really care. As long as I'm having a good time, it can be as easy or hard as necessary. And I think it's awesome that you get to play at your level. Gaming is Montessori confirmed

I'm honestly okay with all of this. Make me feel cool games
Oh boy. 

I dont think anyone ever claimed Bioshock is a particularly hardcore / difficult game.  And yes, the first shots missing you is a good way to tip you off a enemy is nearby , raises tension yet doesnt punish you for either missing a enemy, or in some cases, even not being able to look into the future.

Also, Sekiro, as far as im aware, doesnt have any of those systems. Sure there are some anti frustration features as TV Tropes likes to call them, but the game still expects you to make full use of your tools.
Matpat: "It's a fact".
Internet: "But that's just a theory"
Sekiro is an easy game if you explore. Sekiro is a hard game but if you eavesdrop on on soldiers outside chained ogre, they will mention that chained ogre is afraid of fire, then you go back and explore only to find an old lady who tells you to pray to buddha statue and when you reach hirata state and explore the region, you will find the fire tool which is very effective against chained ogre. And if you keep exploring chained ogre region and climb the hill you will find the firecracker tool which is also very effective.


If you turn right after chained ogre, theres a hidden headless boss fight. You wont be able to do much damage and the boss will easy kill you. Later in the game you will find devine confetti, and in the item description it says its effective against these types of enemies. 


Theres tons of prosthetic tools and upgrades which are effective against a mini boss or a boss. The game is hard, its YOUR job to make it easy for yourself by exploring.
I dont hate souls-like games, i just hated the fact that when i die once in dark souls you health gets significantly reduced and its almost impossible to bring back up. It‚Äôs like they expected you to not die once on super hard game.
Does Sekiro have DDA? Or is it just up to rng with how bosses go about their attack patterns after death? 
** Sekiro boss spoiler warning**




I died to lady butterfly a lot (specifically to her 2nd phase) But the time I beat her, I noticed that during that run, she opted not to use her butterfly kunai against me too much. The first few times she'd spam them to cover her openings, but that final time seemed like she held off on them. Was it rng that the boss didn't use those attacks? Or perhaps DDA hiding behind the curtains? Oooh. Makes me wonder if that's true for just her, or other bosses? Just defeated the corrupted Monk, killed her on my 3rd try, and didn't notice any big changes to her patterns over those runs.
Not all games should have easy or dynamic difficulty. If they're built for that experience I think that's great, but if someone wants the steep difficulty that a Fromsoft game advertises I think that they shouldn't have to compromise that for an audience that isn't interested in what they're selling.
Well thanks. Now I can never enjoy a game again.
Yeah I officially miss edited matpat, this new way of editing isn‚Äôt bad the original way was just more enjoyable
My response... Git gud!
I have an idea for a theory: What is going on in the Rusty Lake series
this entire video is a red herring, you didnt touch a single point in sekiro¬¥s game mechanics, you only talked about other games associated their design to sekiro.
dynamic difficulty comes more out of the respect and excitement for the player. making every game explicitly have an easy mode just ruins more of the fun for me. with how the dynamic difficulty works, why make a game easier when the game is already programmed to do that from the start?
How dare you, MatPat?  I never said I was good at games!
(Seriously, my reaction times suck.  My friends once convinced me to try a rhythm game, and it took me like 15 minutes just to pass the 10 second "training" round.)
If I buy a game, I would rather choose a difficulty mode than the system choosing for me. If there is not a difficulty mode and the game tells you it is hard, all the more the reason for the system to NOT change anything.
Look at the enemy pattern in the new God of War and you will notice that the biggest difference between hard and easy is how many times you press the same button.
Instead of using a better strategy you will use the same strategy, repeating it 2 to 4 times more.
How many Phantoms are there do a Theory on this please
Then there's Masahiro Sakurai, who's more blatant about his difficulty alterations, and actually works with the player to utilize it as a feature they can work with.


Just look at Kid Icarus Uprising. Instead of hiding a health bar boost, once the health bar is depleted it breaks, and it becomes clear to the player that they are on their last legs.


And the difficulty lowering aspect, is actually utilized as a part of the gameplay. You set the difficulty at the begining, if you die it goes down in front of your eyes, and you can choose to start on hard all over again, or continue at a slightly easier mode, at the expense of points and loot to buy better items.


It's also like this on Classic Mode, in Super Smash Bros 3DS, Wii U and Ultimate.
while it's not hidden, splatoon has an interesting take on sliding difficulty. for every consecutive match you win, it adds 1 point/flag to a score bar. this point basically acts a temporary level buff/multiplier. so if you're level 5, you'll be matched with other level 5s, but with say, 2 points, you'll be matched with level 7 players. so, if you have the skill of a level 30 player, start a new account at level 1, and keep winning consecutively,  you'll very quickly be a level 1 player matched with level 30s since that's where your skill level is.

I always said that games today (yeah, even dark souls) are not as hard as old school super Nintendo games
I mean honestly, DnD has been doing it for a while as well, with Dms fudging rolls behind the screen, and modifying enemies to balance the game. As far as I am concerned, this is good game design, so long as the players are happy, and unaware
They are known for being hard, what's so hard to understand. The game isn't aimed at for the casual player that wants a hand holding adventure.
I haven't watched this channel in probably over a year.  Nice to see that Matt is just as pretentious as always.

"It's clear that game developers lie to you"

Right after citing gaming journalists.

Yeah, sure Matpat. Let's just listen to the journalists, they never lie. (Looks over at the persona 5 smash controversy)
I'm OK with difficulty settings - if you don't like easy mode don't play it.
But if you have dynamic difficulty give the player an option to turn it off, and make sure they know it's there.
I think it depends on the game.
Just don't make normal mode into an unlockable hard mode, GameFreak.
I've always feel like when I'm playing poorly at a boss in a game and I finally beat it, it "seemed" easier. Guess it actually was.
cough: also a from software published game: 3D Dot Game Heroes. has a 1 hit death mode. has a 1hit kills enemy mode.
Humans answer me..
What is a baby?
Well this just ruined my play through of doom
I‚Äôd love to see a theory on Fortnite
I had to play xcom 2 on the easiest difficulty and my pride hurts.
just play minecraft on peaceful mode
hey you bought a green screen
I know I‚Äôm not good at some games I got Arkham knight a few months back and I‚Äôm stuck in the subway with the tanks
This why i play normal instead of easy.
Great concept.
I'll be honest, ever since Sega and PS1. I got close to beating one of the old Sonic games, close, died and had to start all the way over. MegaMan wasn't any better. PS1 and PS2 idk what kept happening to the memory card(siblings?), getting close to beating a game and losing and having to start completely over. Said screw it, idc, I'll even add cheats
Easy mode?....put it in super mario maker let's see.ü§î
MatPat I dunno if this matters to you but as a 27 year old who used to love your videos then kinda grew out of them this video was fantastic. If you make more videos like this and balance it with videos gauged at younger audiences maybe you can keep a lot of your older subbs who are tiring of certain aspects of the channel.
you present it like it's a bad thing.
So... if we complete the game on the hardest difficulty on our first try with no flaws or fails, can we be as good as we think we are again?
IMO, dynamic difficulty is a good thing. If I spend half an hour trying to get past one part of a game, I'm going to be very frustrated, and probably quit, possibly for good.
Im still gonna wait for matpat to continue the petscop series-
I don't have really a horse in the "easy difficulty or no" race but your argument here isn't actually relevant to that discussion, so your framing is a bit disingenuous.
Yes, games have inbuilt systems to manipulate the difficulty or the players experience to produce tension, but all of those, including DDA, exist on top of the existing difficulty slider. Easy mode is still easier than normal mode which is still easier than hard mode.
Take the RE4 example, yes, the game removes two enemies from the scenario to make it easier, but the remaining enemies still do more damage, take more damage and act more aggressively on normal than they do on easy. Normally the amount of wiggle room generated by DDA and the like, is relatively insignificant compared to the the main settings.


If anything, I'd say your DDA argument is actually a push for the "no easy mode" camp, because advocates of easy mode generally do so on the grounds of "we paid for the game, we should get to see all of the content", which you could counter with "the existence of DDA means that any especially difficult hurdles can be lowered accordingly, meaning you can see the whole game without an easy mode anyway".


As an aside, my personal position is that we should let the designers choose what to do with their own games. Even if we as a community somehow mandated every game to have an easy mode, who is to say what constitutes "easy"? There are bound to be some players who find easy mode on a game difficult. Unless you remove any form of difficulty entirely, there are always going to be people who fail, and a game ceases to be a game without a failure state.
If want ultimate hard modes just play original atari, nes and Sega games! Lifeforce anyone?
I knew about some of theese but not all. Thanks for that.

As for Sekiro specifically, with two ways to add more general difficulty (kuro's charm and bell demon) technically the default is the easy mode.
sonic
All games with DDA should have a DDA option.
hey game theory you have work:
-new videos of  petscop
- katana zero
Get back to work
People take games way to seriously and gaming a quality has declined because of it, the souls game are a shinning example of that
Video Ideea: Could the engines in "The Wandering Earth" actually push the planet.
Smash Bros does this and outright tells you, too
Ok, yeah, I knew this already. But I wouldn‚Äôt say this mechanics make the game easy... they‚Äôre just design choices. You got a little more clickbaity than usual there matpat.
I rarely play easy if there's a trophy that requires you to play easy mode then sure
I recall playing time splitters 3 and thinking "wow, I survive a lot better with barely any health"  at the time I thought it just meant I was cautious but I see my mistake
I always play on the easiest mode because I am bad at every game.
Since the new Sonic trailer just dropped and I noticed Sonic basically blacked out an entire town by running and the electricity he produces while running, could you do a theory on how much voltage Sonic would need to emit in order to be able to do this? Or a revised theory on how fast movie version Sonic is?
Here's a controversial stance: Players are under no obligation to play a game on any particular difficulty mode, and developers are under no obligation to provide any particular difficulty mode for their players. Both decisions are the sole prerogative of each respective party, and it will ultimately be market forces that determine which choices are ultimately correct in any particular case.
I guess that's why ZUN, the creater of touhou project always has his games super hard. To show that real gamers played his games. Or maybe he was just lazy and couldn;t be bothered to adjust and reprogram the codes for all of his bullet hell games.

BTW any touhou gamers around?
It's better for a game to be super hard than easy. For example far cry
love the new video format
Its their decision if they want to make Sekiro like that. I honestly ONLY play DS etc... because they are challenging and dont serve you everything on a silver platter but thats just my opinion. People should adapt to the game, not the game to the people.
I look forward to the theory linking the Dragon‚Äôs Blood in Sekiro and the blood in Bloodborne.
I only use easy mode to follow and understand the plot and story of the game then go back on the hardest difficulty in the game
sekiro and dark soul games do have an easy mode however they are nonconventional things like multiple paths and summoning of other players to help you but that is greatly reduce in sekiro than dark souls as it is completely single player but at least all the bosses in sekiro follow simple patterns infernoplus made a great video explaining it

PS. GIT GUD
Easy mode? too easy we must have an ultra easy mode where all enemies just kill themselves.
"Hard mode" for me was trying to get all the achievements for Halo 3 on top of getting recon, but looking back, the real hard mode was getting 50 as I was stuck at rank 45 lol
Me wanting to ruin the movie

Someone avoiding spoilers

Me Iron man  in Black widow died the end of endgame
you are not good at games
(angry engineer noises)
IM ABAUT TO LAY YOU DAWN!
But the important question is this:
Do Sekiro uses DDA too?
I love the new format Matt!!
2:05 yeah this chanel ain't fo' me boss cya!
I like the live action stuff. It makes it more personal.
As a former programmer, game designer, and play tester i can say...
Yeah ofcourse its made easier

When you design a game and it gets tested constantly, and youre playing your own stuff constantly, you get a false sense of difficulty as you are a creator of that world
Others dont have the privalige of playtesting your for a year

And you go in without that experience with these games, its kinda unfair
Sekiro doesn‚Äôt need an easy mode because It already has a cheesy mode
played over 100 games of fortnite. still couldn't kill anyone so... guess there isn't any dmg bonus in that game
this is why i love getting over it :P
re-watching and skipping to the ad mark
Soooo here's an example of easy mode. Smash brothers ultimate. It's a game that let's you change it at will, which is my favorite type. I played on normal most of the time but if it got to hard, I would change to easy (I literally had to be told to do it since I could not beat giga bowser) And yea! I'm glad I did that! It stopped me from being stuck on one level. This is why I love these types!
Okay, I know I'm nerding about Nintendo but who cares, another example here! Kid Icarus Uprising! If you die on let's say 7 difficulty, it's brought down to 6 but it NEVER goes below 2 (2 is still DIRT easy tbh) and it does difficulty locking very well! It locks different doors  behind a difficulty and gives you either food or a shortcut and a bit of extra dialog.
Ok. Sorry for long comment.
Still hoping for a kid icarus theory.
I don't care what it's about.
Unless saying the good guys are evil.
So ya. 
Thanks for reading.
I always wondered why certain games it feels like the damage decreases the more you play online, for instance at the beginning levels ina  bunch of games it seems like quarter of a clip is easy if needed at most. a few matches later your now 20 or so levels above what you were and have to reload every 2-3 kills. I always thought it weird but just assumed it was bad accuracy rolls. But now i know the truth... grab the pitch forks and fire bombs time to go deal with some developers!!! lool
You know toning down the difficulty in general being a problem i get. But why a mode you are in no way required to use and is completely optional having people up in arms just confuses me.
In short, matpat explains what damage forgiveness is.
Just choose normal and let the game figure the rest out after you‚Äôve left yourself in the middle it can make it easier or harder based on this theory
No green screen the next time please
This was a really well made video. 


I think DDA is a good thing. Its up to the game devs how difficult they want to design their game, but also up to the gamer if they want to cheat or not without being shamed for it (unless multiplayer).


I think the different ending for different difficulty modes originated more as a bonus for beating the hard mode, an extra bit of reward for the players dedication and that's a good thing and gives players a reason to replay the game on hard after having finishing it once, though i think normal difficulty should always be the full canon experience. 
Shaming the player for easy mode is just wrong though, levels shouldn't be locked away and while a baby joke while choosing difficulty is funny there shouldnt be a constant reminder for the rest of the playtrough. some people just wanna get home from a day of hard work and feel like a goddamn superhero.
"you're not as good at games as you think you are"
Me, with 171 games of Minecraft hunger games played and a whopping 2 wins: I'm well aware
If you know what you‚Äôre getting into, why would you buy the game? There‚Äôs hard core gamers and games for recreation dummies. When you play a game like serkiro it‚Äôs not just for the story it‚Äôs for the combat.
Do a video finding the PERSONA 5 lore
You literally don't said anything. The dynamic difficulty is a thing sure. But we need to know specifically what changes do games like Dark Souls or Sekiro after many death. And if this type of advantages are so good to say "yes. This is a easy mode".
In any case, if I chose the hardest difficulty. It's fine to have some help if I die 20 times in a row. At least I chose the hardest difficulty to have a challenge.
Now it makes sense why those defaults do more damage than me with a grey tac in Fortnite
Wow, no comment (that I can see) about Homeworld 2, where the dynamic difficulty was NOTORIOUS on first release (forcing the first patch to reduce how much harder it could make the game). Oh so many fun memories fighting a horde of ships multiple times  bigger than your max fleet cap . . .
I love dynamic difficulty adjustment done right. It's the perfection of entertainment. Really helps to keep the mental state of the flow. I've heard that Arcade games got easier after beating the player too much. To keep that sweet money rollin.
It'd be great if games allowed the player to turn off DDA. Maybe after the first playthrough or outright.

The more options the players have over difficulty the better. Trust me, people are able to find something they enjoy playing. Loved that about many Halo games: besides a couple of difficulty modes the skulls gave plenty of opportunities to tweak everything.

And that Video from Mark Brown is awesome. Actually, most if not all of his content is pretty stellar.
What about ocarina of time master quest?
Always knew I was not that good of a player and never really wanted to be either. I just love playing on my level where I seem just a tad good and it is fine to me.
I knew DDA was a thing
You buy a book, you are responsible for reading it. You could buy a book of Shakespeare‚Äôs work, but you have to read it or have some one else read it for you. You still pay for the book.

You buy a movie, you‚Äôre responsible to watch it. You may not understand what‚Äôs going on, that‚Äôs fine, what you bought was what you wanted to do: watching.

When you buy a game, you bought what you wanted to do: playing. You may not get through it, but you‚Äôre still responsible for playing it (or have some one play for you).
I uh play games on easy for story.. pinup the difficulty when I fi ish the first time. I usually go up to realistic if its allowed and take weeks to win
... that was... actually fascinating.
i don't play a lot of the more hard core games to start with, and frankly, i wouldn't care if the game dissed me for easy mode. i play for mindless relaxation, not to raise my b.p.
but these sorts of behind the scenes things are still pretty interesting to me. call me weird but i Like watching vids about how things work. be it from the devs' p.o.v., a math stand point or whatever.
but then, i suck at movie watching for the same reason... i'm looking at the guy behind the curtain instead of caring if lassie got her message across about an idiot child going into abandoned mines because mommy and daddy were off ignoring the whole parenting thing.
Remember Donkey Kong 3? That might actually have dynamic difficulty. If you fail you get what the game calls a "1-UP Start" in which there is a power-up on the ropes DK hangs from that increases the power and distance of your bug spray thus making it easier to defeat DK. this might be one of the oldest forms of dynamic difficulty that MatPat missed.
I remember playing games on hard mode for unknown reasons...
it was hard yet felt satisfying once i got things done

then i saw this video...
it changed everything
bcz of the new formet of their videos

the DDA whatcha call it
yeh i didn't understand a thing
Can you ride on a minigun
That Gears of War information came out a decade after it's release. So it could be entirely possible many current games do the same thing, it's just that they won't say it yet.
You seem to be under the impression that this all was a secret. At least, most old gamers knew this. This is not exactly a secret.
Fortnite  story line
mmmh i play every game (if possible) with perma death mode, i played for 3 seasons in diamond SC2 (WoL, WoL, HotS), i regularly beat games and get rare (because difficult to get) achievements (super meatboy, for example) .. I think I am as good of a gamer as I might think.

And I think every game needs to opportunity for a player to turn all assisting systems off. Like for example, nothing is more cancerous than that these poor little console peasants have to suffer from aim assistance in their shooters.
Are you telling me...

Ultra hard mode was...

EASY!?!?


Also I learned something today. Thanks.
Anyone else feel like up until this point your game was made to be harder then you friends games? Or play a game and while it being the same as your friend only to see your difficultly level was higher then any of your friends? Or (while it doesn‚Äôt apply to me but I throw it out there anyway) having a friends game be way to hard for you but your friend walks through like he owns the place while you struggle? I say this though for me I guess it makes sense that the game is harder when I or anyone who plays it at max difficulty and has it scale against you it should have the adaptability that it does I guess it just makes it more personal or more immersive.
... Annnddd cut! 

Ur welcome
I‚Äôve gotta say, after not watching GT for a long while, I‚Äôm really loving this new style with Matt actually in the episodes, and not as just a voice.
simple answer, git gud.
I love the shoutout to the Wii version of Smash bros MatPat :)
13:30 My dad has that game since 2004... and he still has a very old Playstation 4 and i saw him playing a very old quality game and i was like.....


Wow ..so that's what old games from long time ago when programing already exist and still progressing to get better quality and better modles...

Even though my dad thought i might get  tripped over the mine line but i avoid it at the first level of the game XD....So when i got caught by a Chainsaw boss in the village
I exploded that guy with the Mine Trip Line Xd!!!!
I really don‚Äôt care about a hard mode as long as it‚Äôs not artificial difficulty aka giving them more HP and doing more damage making your attacks do less damage etc
Damn millennials, runing everything.
Was this meme just killed now?
It noticeable in (some) racing games. Where no matter how fast you are going, what car you pick, drive skill etc. If your in first place with the best car in the game and know how to handle to it. To the point that you could do donuts around every car in the race for the entirety of the race and still win. There is always at least one car behind you ready to take your 1st place. Same if you are last. As some racers above you will drive much slower. But will  drive a bit faster. The closer you get to 1st. 

Giving the feel that you could bounce back up and win the race. Or not at least not in last place (as beside doing nothing till all racers finish the race before you. Is very difficult)
Hit the Like button for the funny intro and tragically couldn't add a second Like for the video overall. Way to hit the issue where it counts, MatPat!
Dang this vid was pretty interesting
umm im going to un sub now
why does matt keep showing up in the vids? i kinda liked the old format
Dear MatPat
I know you have been through a lot of hard and difficult times. But you should never forget there are many people who like  your Videos. Just take me as an example my life is litteraly in the wirst Phase it could be but your Videos are the bit of sunshine on a rainy day.

So MatPat If you are reading this, i just want to thank you and keep up the great work.
hey if im going to enjoy a game more than give me those fake buffs and memorable moments of living on almost no hp when i normally wouldnt be
Okay, fine video and all, but personally, major issue with this specifically, and I guess it's just because of my personal history with the game in your title, but..

Your video has absolutely nothing to do with Sekiro in general, I'm sure it was chosen because it's topical and guaranteed more clicks that way, but you could have at least pulled an example of DDA from the game in question, or any game under From's belt at the least. I generally enjoy your videos but it's almost like the title and lack of references to it makes me feel cheated.
I thought matpat was going to say ‚ÄúITS A FAT‚Äù
Sekiro should respect it's players and add Big Anime Tiddies
I play PES a lot, at "top player" difficulty. I was thinking something along the lines of "after a few quality wins, this feels like "top player 2.0"". I would trash Juventus, Inter, Milan and Fiorentina with a young Napoli squad (domestic league, did some transfers before) and i. e. Barca in the Champions League. Then, all of a sudden, I'm struggling against Pescara and Paleemo, and Frosinone beats me easily, 3:0. Damn, good to knos this exists and it has a name.
Epic Games's Multiplayer Boosts aside, does any of this really matter? They're single player experiences. The way I play RE4 doesn't effect how you play it. So what if I only had to gun down seven people in the water room? It doesn't matter. The option to turn off these things on and off would be nice (alongside some accessibility options and tweaks to make it easier maybe) Because, like I said. One player. Single experience. Has no bearing on anyone else's enjoyment of it.
Imagine having all that DDA on your side,making the game easier to you and you still couldn't beat it...
Imagine being a game jornalists OOF
HUGE DEBATING
Game jornalists,and everyone disagreeing said game jornalists.
dda is the equivalent of a participation trophy.
Pls do a theory of how my dad got invisible for 4 years
ignores every game that difficult is an main appeal like cuphead, hollow knight,celeste,etc...
I was learning about the extra health stuff earlier this year and noticed that when playing through undertale again and going against Asgore if I had 5 health an attack that would take 5 hp normally only took 4 hp.
You being "BABI"ed?? What that??üòÇüòÇüòÇ kinda cunttish understanding about world single tracked tho!
But the thing is that it only effects games that are only played by one or four players, not online server type games. So technically, this theory is a 50% bust.
A perfect example for DDA is One Finger Death Punch, a game in the spirit of 2010 youtube stick fight animations. Enemys come from the left and right, and you literally just press 2 buttons, left or right, to attack them, the better you are, the faster the enemys approach, the game is very open about it and even shows you a percentage of how much it is increased in percent in th top left.
Also can you do a theory on epic Mickey ps I just want to see a theory on it because is the only game I play ya I only have the old wii
I rarely enjoy beating a hard game, it gets annoying fast getting killed/defeated over and over again and it does feel like work to beat such a situation. There is no satisfaction for me in this. This is my problem and I know that I am most likely alone with this, but this is also the reason I never played any fromsoft games and I actually don't feel any need to do so. 
I would actually be quite happy if all games would just have dynamic difficulty and would thus be just as hard or as easy to beat as the player needed it to be.
You didn't talk about sekiro at all?
but they do allow you to see the whole game.. if not then i just download those kind of games.. (cus if im gonna hack/mod a game i rather download it and pirate it than getting banned for using cheats/mods on said game)
Dynamic difficulty won't work in Sekiro. The game is not hard at all if you approach a fight correctly. There's a gigantic difference in the outcome of fights depending on how you approach an encounter. A easier Sekiro would be a hollow game devoid of all sense of tension and reward. Progressing through the game makes YOU a better player, it doesn't just make the protagonist stronger.
I only play games for the story, no matter how much or little story there actually is.  That's why I unashamedly always put my games on the easiest difficulty level I'm allowed even if I've played the game multiple times.
Matpat: ITS A "FACT"!!!
Intro: GAME "THEORY"
I remember the crossbowmen disappearing in Resident Evil 4. I thought it was a bug. I always notice when the difficulty seems to adjust in games though. As a trick, it works, until I know it's working, then I feel cheated. It strips me of the ability to truly conquer a section in its most difficult state.
When you said "You're just not good at games as you think you are" I felt that. I couldn't help but "oof" 20 times.
I understand why developers do this. I work at a laser tag arena, we do similar things. If one team is losing really bad one game. The next we might give one team a little bit of a health buff. Or for  birthday party's, if the birthday kid hasn't won a game we will give him a suped up gun. The players end up having more fun in the end. It might be fun to win but that get boring after a while. Losing a game keeps it fun because it makes you think more and really interact with the game instead of just gliding through thinking your going to win.
Theory
16:03 thats why i am always so good in world of thanks when i start playing again but when i progress i just keep failing.
I have been lied!
Dynamic difficulty gets harder the better you play though. So if I beat RE4 on professional without dying (which I have), that means I'm pretty good huh?
16:00 Oh. So it's even more pathetic that I only have one kill in Fortnite T-T
I would be fine with this if we could toggle DDA
He never applied any of the stuff he talked about to FromSoft games. They definitely doesn‚Äôt do that DDA thing as all enemies reset at bonfires for one.
Okay but what's his point? Besides what you said about multiplayer advantages for new/bad players, this is something very well known, and a good part of game design.
I realized I wasn't that great in college. I was just a big fish in a small pond. Also challenge and adversity is a necessary component of some experiences especially culturally along peers but also for one's self. There are a lot of let's plays to watch and other media. Making everything into pablum is dull. Variety great on the other side of a similar debate I like a little heat as in spice in food now and then but I can't take some things others prefer and that's ok by me.

Some games I had trouble with in the past that I dropped and came back to seemed easier later. Others seem impractical or broken. There are bad games. It's a fine distinction.

Do people not notice some of the dynamic difficulty on their own?
im still not getting used to seeing you in the videos
Does this kind of thing remind anyone of something done in sports called a Handicap where a lower skilled player gets an advantage playing against one with a higher skill level. (Eg... Bowling, Golf )
Stay calm and watch machinimas.
i think thats pretty cool that they do that because its so unnoticable, i dont see a problem with it so if ppl are mad about it then thats kinda wierd
Better question: why do people care what modes a game has or what mode someone else plays on? Choose your favorite, and move on with your life. 

oh, and where did this idea that easy mode was a cheat come from? I'll tell you what's a cheat: typing in "Wuv Woo" and getting invulnerable flying purple rainbow-crapping hippos. That was a cheat (from Age of Mythology, a popular RTS in the late 90s).  It's a cheat because it lets you entirely bypass a game mechanic: your scouts are invulnerable, you can move them into enemy territory and know exactly what's happening. The normal game of spying and counterspying is gone.  Worshiping Odin isn't a cheat: the scout ravens may be free and see farther than human units, but they aren't invulnerable. Choosing Odin as your god makes scouting easier: but you still have to play the game of spying on the enemy while keeping your scouts safe. An easy mode should have all the same mechanics of a hardmode: it's just that those mechanics are less likely to kill you.
Youtube makes games easyer
I'm stubborn when I game. So when I see my difficulty is being adjusted for me, I get upset and try to avoid it. I tell myself "I can't afford to die here or I can't beat it at it's hardest." Or when the Mario & Luigi RPGs ask me if I wanna refight on easy I always say no... but as someone interested in designing games, I often come up with ideas to increase tension and implied difficulty myself. If it goes unnoticed, it generally DOES make the game more fun, and isn't that what's important? Yes I'd say, if the game isn't teaching you anything practical. Of course there's value in improving yourself and sticking to it, but gaming isn't necessarily the best place for that, at least, not all the time.


Still, as far as making adjustments to the game, I would prefer the game asks for consent. After all, as stubborn as I am, if I want to get to more content and story and find it unbeatable/not fun, I will give in. So let the player choose on that case, but as far as things like the phantom health bar, I have no qualm.
I miss the Matpat pictures
I hate DDA, that is why i reload the game instead ok selecting continue
As someone who just defeated the last boss of Sekiro after 3 and a half hours of dying over and over and over, you would think I would be one of those people begging for an easy mode. Nope. Yeah I got really frustrated at the boss and at myself for all those deaths during those 3 and a half hours but with each attempt I was getting better and better. Where at first the 1st phase of the fight took me about 5 minutes and 7 chugs of my healing gourd to beat eventually became where I could beat the 1st phase in under 1 minute and without any damage taken. That's quite a big difference you might say. Normally a difference that big in any other game can only be the result of lowering the difficulty setting, so how can that big difference be possible in a game without difficulty settings like Sekiro? It's because in my opinion it's designed to be deceptively difficult at first glance. Fellow Sekiro players know what i'm talking about as they most likely experienced the same thing. Sometimes when you meet a boss for the first time you get utterly destroyed in seconds to the point that you feel like you're way out of your league here but after you beat the boss and continue playing, you find yourself thinking "you know now that i think about it that boss wasn't actually that hard" This is because upon first encounter you don't know the boss's move sets or how will he react to your attacks. The more you fight him the more you start to realize "He always does a thrust attack after he does a jumping slash so that's my time to Mikiri counter him for big posture damage" so it's not that you got better at the game per se....it's more like you know what's coming, you know what attacks to expect, you know how the enemy will react. With repeated attempts you get fed so much information about how the boss's AI works that eventually your brain will know ahead of time how your finger muscles should react to defend yourself and inflict damage on him. I can not explain to you the amazing feeling I experienced when i finally beat him after 3 and a half hours of trying. If the players are allowed to turn down the difficulty setting instead of persevering, they're just robbing themselves of that euphoric feeling that no other game franchise can deliver.
Nah I'm just a masochist and like to suffer ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Game theory: *There‚Äôs a deeper meaning*
"Matt and Pat didn't notice."

They literally pointed it out and talked about it seconds after that clip dude.
Depends on what type of game you play.
Thank you for not judging players who prefer easy games and those who prefer difficult games. As you were preventing your piece I honestly believed you would box us into some negative stereotype.
Dat Intro. Nuf Said.
I know to some of you this is basically sacrilege but I've managed to fun playing a game with cheats forget easy mode and the way I see it the whole point is to have fun and if people are enjoying what they have then why mess with a good system.
I'm mixed about this. Sometimes I play on easy when I enjoy the exploring aspect more than the fighting aspect in a game. AC Odyssey for example. The map is so big I just wanna finally finish it and move on to another game. So I put it on easy to be able to finish it quicker.
Petscop released a lot of new videos
See, that's why I love Monster Hunter. No indications of how much health the monster has lost or how much it has won back except for a few pshysical sings here and there makes you think that you are winning just before your inevitable defeat xD
Sekiro‚Äôs EZ Mode is using the prosthetic tool to beat bosses.
Ha, jokes on you, I always pick the easiest mode, because I suck at gaming...
Can we go back to watching YouTube? Not really a fan of the TV style production this channel has changed into.
For last question: 
I want to pick the difficulty myself. I usually start of with easy medium to see what the game has. Most games have literally unfair spots, so on hardest difficulty every mistake is on me. 

People who want to play it on hard right from the start make themselves a challenge.

In games that have no difficulty settings, like Mario jump and run games, I decide to to the hardest level with mo power ups and speedrun it, not finishing till I basically "destroyed" each section that was suppose to be hard by running through it with mo stopping. Some games I start on hard. 

I sometimes know of games lowering the difficulty so I have to quit and reload or turn on the game to fight it on hardest difficulty. I wish they would stop it. I see the change... it's discouraging for me...
I need to show this to my sister so I can ruin resident evil for her üòà
Hey matpat just noticed the total revamp of dhmis wanna check it out??? Have a good day
This is true. I never passed Metroid or Zelda on the Nintendo. I only beat Comtra with the 30 player cheat. Have I beat the Dark Souls games and Bloodborne? Yes, but only after leveling up characters stats enough to make the boss kills 'lucky' enough for me.
Left 4 Dead Series has The Director.
After beating loads of game on normal   where every game was a chore to me, I finally accepted that I'm bad at games. Now I pretty much play everything on easy and am having so much more fun.
Hey MattPatt,
You still have't apologized for that TF2 vs. Overwatch video you did.
Don't start thinking that two years is enough for everyone to forget your mistakes.
You even have the audacity to delete reasonable complaint comments on that video, let alone keep the video posted online.
That video shows a severe lack of research and respect, especially with respect to TF2. You spent more time editing than you did actually getting good info.
Now let us review what choices you have:
You can either delete that video and post a sincere apology, or you can leave that video alone as an eternal reminder of how low-quality, uninformed, and disrespectful your videos actually are.
if you want to play a hard game or two get ahold of ninja gaiden for the NES or ghosts n goblins also NES... then come n cry about difficulty
I could not beat the last fight in Superman 64. Damn brainiac
Stopped the vid at 2:56 but please mention that Devs intentionally made games easier for western audiences
I plays pop games .is I am the only one?
And From is sitting watching this like "there is no such thing as bad publicity"
screeee
9:25 looks like someone beat the naughty sorceress.
DDA is just common sense and normal why are you getting so salty mat cuz if you dont put DDA in your game it feels like my flappy bird clone to salty to early
I miss old game Theory it's like you're doing this for children now and if you are that cool start a side channel for them I've never complained about a YouTube series changing but damn matpat unsubscribe oh wait no I'll stay around for Austin
Uhh, more options > less options. Let us choose our solid, rock-hard, unchanging difficulty, OR choose dynamic difficulty! :D
Dose some day come a Theory about Little Nightmares?
Nobody:


MatPat: Your not as good at games then you think you are.

Game Devs: (Shows DDA.) Perfectly Balanced for their specific needs As It Should Be.
I play games for the story. Since I suck at games, I want an easy mode ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What about fifa?
I‚Äôve always thought of it as shields it kinda reminds me of halo like right after you lose your shields you still had a bit of hp before you died that‚Äôs how I always thought it worked...feels bad probably because I think like this it reduced tension for meh
The meme that has been going around in the wake of the Sekiro drama. 

There is still a difference between playing as the developers intended and altering dynamics yourself. 

The point still stands.
For me, it depends on the game. Some "hard modes" are more tedious than difficult. When the enemies are just bullet sponges, it feels like a waste of time.
And yet, neverwinter has no mercy, they got rid of players ability to lifesteal enemy health making you die FASTER, while making healers more useful
Gamers:

Gamers that play from software games: "great more of the same from what I've come to love from this dev"

Game Journo: "Cup head tutorial is too hard!"
So in other words you put sekiro in the title purely for YouTube's algorythim?
This is why I crank the difficulty when I start to think im good.
Because the next stage is boredom.
Forces you out of your play routine.
Makes things fun again!
What about halo 2 jackal snipers on legendary
What if you made a theory about Wraith's True Origin from Apex Legends?
Hard mode has been "Normal" for me Ever Since Halo  e.e;
this is why i play escape from tarkov XD
Sekiro isn't hard its just muscle memory, change my mind.Sekiro isn't hard its just muscle memory, change my mind.
Are you PROUD of your assault on fun, matpat?
Why is there a GOW picture instead of a Sekiro pic on the thumbnail???
Really great video! Super interesting to see how game design made player experiences more easy over the years. This also connects to no tutorials or maps or any explanations games had back in time. Now we are guided every little step of the way. And all that so we won‚Äôt get frustrated and quit the game. And I love the new Game Theory Video concept.
I actually... do not really mind... I always play on easy. And at the end of the day, I just like winning. I do work every day, I do not want to have to work in my free time too. I am very non-competitive and I want games to give me a good time. So .. adjust difficulty and do not tell me xD Give me easy modes to see all of the game. And give others harder difficulties so they can suffer as much as they want ;)
i played bloodborne and i have gotten very used to it and it became much more easier for me
No, it's not the "Gaming Community."  It's the gamers vs posers.
:shocked pikachu: I thought I was a badass completing all the Crash as a kid :O Now Im not sure :'(
I don't get this debate. If you don't want an easy mode, don't use it. All there is to it.
Do petscop episode 17 to 21
i feel personally attacked
What happend to 
Deadlock??
I really like when games do that. Sometimes I really just don't wanna y'know.. go through a boss battle 5 times then get mad, stop playing and go take a nap cause i got a headache.
I always knew this ways a thing games did, cause it just.. makes sense.. I'd notice if I'd die a lot in a game that enemies would become less hostile, some would vanish, ect. And it made me as a player a lot happier cause I was so exhausted of that quest/area by then I just wanted to HAVE FUN AGAIN!!
I'm not about that INTENSE GAMER life, i get full on migraines when games are too hard (call me weak, i don't care. just how it is man)
So when a game pushes me violently I have to put it down. Heck for 2-3 years I NEVER finished psychonauts because the ending was too hard. thats one of my absolute favorite games ever but i'm TERRIBLE at it and I can't play it too long before a headache happens. 
I've always wanted to get into Dark Souls cause it looks AMAZING and i love the lore. but I sadly can't cause I'd need a "pathetic wittle baby mode uwu" to finish it. I'd be down for a pathetic baby mode then work my way up to "you still suck but like.. we don't gatta hold your hand" mode.
I'm a simple person. I play games to have fun. Not get mad and break my monitor. 
There are very few games i actually enjoy the RUSH if a long intense battle, and i love those games. but its usually vs people which makes it more satisfying than NPC that can counter me 100 times.
I also prefer story over gameplay, idk i'm weird. so when a game halts my progress from enjoying the story with intense battles i can't get pass it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Its why GW2 has been sitting "on the shelf" for me because its exhausting for my pathetic baby brain to get through the story. I just wanna see my dragon daughter and adventure man!!
0:39 Don't forget TF2 Vs Overwatch.
Does RTS games have Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment?
0:56 facts don't care about your feelings
When will you do another theory on Splatoon and/or Splatoon 2? It has so much lore and so many little adjustments (maybe splatoon nerfs itself? Idk lol) It'd be a gold mine. Great theory though, made me think!
Still #50 on trending as of the end of April
Ik DDA is in the injustice and mk I just thought I was just tripping
But sekiro doesn't have dynamic difficulty.
Mat what happened? You were so full of energy in your old videos. Now you seem to so much more restrained. Your game theory! You took these conversational things head on! You would scream and yell!
But now there's just nothing. No spark no rants. I'm not mad I'm disappointed you can do better I know you can.
You know MatPat, it often depends on the game. Most games having a difficulty slider is often a good thing.  It tells the AI what should and should not happen. For example: Take Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Often times, when the game is set to Easy Mode, it makes it to where the Enemy Bosses have less health, less armor, and less damage. a kind of power fantasy, so to speak.

Sometimes, however, that isn't enough. For Example: Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown.

While it does have a slider for the type of difficulty, if the game notices you keep resetting a lot, then it will outright make the AI even more stupid jus to give players a fighting chance.
this made me think of "a hat in time" in the DLC death wishes. when you died/failed 3 times you would be asked if you want to "have a little help". i like that. also i feel that it's cheap for a DDA to adjust the game on the first death. at least wait for the player to die alot to same thing before adjusting
I gained skills. I play Melee. No ez mode in tournaments vs other players.
Does buying a game entitle you to see the ending or to win at it?


Good question, does buying a guitar entitle you to be able to play songs on it?


Does buying a car entitle you to be capable of driving it?


Does buying a set of oil paints entitle you to suddenly have artistic talent?


As I'm sure you've guessed by now the answer to all of those is no, you certain have the potential with all of those purchases to make the most out of them but this is far from an entitlement to be able to do so, any time you purchase something that requires input on your part to use or take advantage of the onus falls upon yourself to either already be competent enough to do so or to become competent enough to do so.


This is why rather than complaining that things should be made easier for you, take greater control over your purchasing decisions and either limit yourself to things you know you'll enjoy or invest the time and effort needed to make the most of your purchase, again, would you blame a guitar manufacturer if you bought one and after a couple of days you weren't able to play any songs? 


Or would they just tell you that you need to practice? (and a good guitar can often cost a lot more than a good game)
:(
Dynamic Difficulty needs to be a tickable option. Or, never seen in anything above normal modes.
"From needs to respect their players and add an easy mode to their game." ...wow, and people said my generation was entitled...
I wanna choose easy mode.  I also want a super difficult mode.
"Hard Mode is a LIE!" doesn't talk about a hard game...
tell those journalists to play Crash Bandicoot!
oh, wait, it's quite a hard game on today's standards
Sekiro isn't hard its just muscle memory, change my mind.

sekiro took me lest time to finish then dark souls 3
Sekiro started hard, got easy quick, then became hard again in higher levels of newgame+. Best game 10/10 thank you Miyazaki for not pandering to games journalists.


Edit: Newgame +3 is when the last boss started becoming difficult again for me as the margin of error shrunk considerably due to the limited health bar.
1:49 You can see King's Field, one of From Software's oldest games. Needless to say, its pretty damn hard. But its fun
Easy mode can be good for story emersion
Sekiro is not hard but it's not easy
I think the dynamic difficulty should be toggleable. if I don't want the game to go easy on me I should have that option
Is it weird  that I remember Epic Games because of Gears of War and Bulletstorm?
I feel robbed every time a game uses dynamic difficulty scaling to reduce a challenge that I KNOW I'm only a couple of attempts away from passing. I seriously despise it. If a game uses it, they should be clear and up front about it and give you the option to completely disable it.
Then you get games like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 which now has highly configurable difficulty settings.


I'm pretty sure dynamic difficulty is the least present in RPG (especially turn-based RPG) games since there's always the option to grind.


Then there's racing games where staying ahead of the pack will speed everyone else up or slow everyone down if you're behind, sometimes making some races nearly impossible to win if you don't intentionally stay in second or have a completely flawless run (I'm eyeing you, early-campaign Redout levels)
That explains the odd thing here and there in games growing up. I noticed early on that in the Gameboy Pok√©mon games, Red-Blue-Yellow specifically, you'll catch anything with any ball easier if you just use enough of them over time. Definitely still feels like a thing in current gen games, but not nearly as quick. As for things like enemies not spawning, I think most of us probably just assumed they failed to load in or were a glitch and just took it as such. Weird to think that it was intentional all along for some titles.
That green screen feels 2010 for some reason.
Imagine looking at a company whose games are all famous for being difficult, and then complaining that they‚Äôre difficult. 

Sure, an easier mode could be cool, but the only reason I see is to provide players with a chance to get used to the mechanics. After that, why not see what you can really do?
Make a video about baldis basics
So bioshock gave you one extra hit before dying to add to more barely survived moments... OK and? 

You're still going to need to git gud and learn to progress using and refining strategies that you discover in game its a small crutch that's almost irrelevant.
This just proves that Sekiro doesn't need an easy game since probably it has DDA and if you can't make it through it even with that on the game, they just suck.
I thought he was going to bring back Deadlock
The end of the video seems really Anti-DDA. Why, though? It's a trick- but a good-natured one, a trick that has been used for years to help. Get salty about a Noob killing you because of invisible damage buffs. I'll gladly hand myself and everyone else the shaker.
I‚Äôm totally fine with FromSoftware being the outlier in this regard then.  I‚Äôve been beating my head against sekiro on weekends since it came out and I have definitely gotten better.  When I finally beat a major mid game boss, it felt like a shot of adrenaline or something lol. That was great
This debate is pretty much a every other year cycle
Oh come on... the game isn't THAT hard. Like if people actually timed their parries, counters, and dodges they would be fine in the game. You can't just blindly swing your swords without putting thoughts behind them...
So is there proof From Software does this though?
Left 4 Dead notoriously advertised this gimmick with the "game director," the systems AI that would nerf or amp up the difficulty based on your play through
there is one thing I every game should have though  

Modding, every game should have mods

Valkyrie Profile places it's full content; access to the true ending, bonuses in the post game dungeon, and certain characters and events, behind its difficulty level.  Really, it's more like "Full game" than "Hard mode"
If you know what you‚Äôre getting into, why would you buy the game? There‚Äôs hard core gamers and games for recreation dummies. When you play a game like serkiro it‚Äôs not just for the story it‚Äôs for the combat.
Brawl Stars, Clash Royale and Clash of Clans! You only get unfairly boosted if you empty your wallet!
Does anyone know about games like borderlands and halo?
Back when I played Overwatch there was a ton of suspicion from players that the matchmaking was deliberately designed to prevent losing streaks by putting players who are struggling with players who were on a winning streak. This of course was beneficial for the underdog but made the chances of winning consecutive games lower and lower since you would be repeatedly paired with bad players and forced you to carry them. The only work around for this was to be in a group with other players who were equally as good and therefore the matchmaking could only fill the remaining slots on the team with underdogs. Given that Epic is prepared to do this in a multiplayer game, I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard does as well.
IM ONE OF THE FIRST 1000 PEOPLE TO SEE THIS

Hope i said it right
The hell they need to make time towers way easier on me
God... Guys, the nether is supposed to be an underworld... Like, below bedrock. Might be why there's bedrock ABOVE the nether zone. 

Ok, you want me to solve this for you? 

Draw a circle. Now draw a circle centered inside that circle. Now highlight an inch of the outer circle, and an inch of the inner circle. Now draw a line from the center of both circles from the center to both ends of the highlighted sections, then extend the line from the inner circle's edge to the outer circle. 

Depending on the relative size of the circles, travelling an inch of the inner circle could line you up vertically exponentially more distance. The Nether portals are elevators.
Austin probably spent hours and hours on this theory and then comes the comments section completely destroying every bit of it.
Most of the comments are like
"Austin you dont understand minecraft"
Ding dong your theory is wrong
The nether is inside the earth and its radius is 1/8th of the total radius of the earth
The portal is just an elevator
This means if you go down and walk 1 meter and then go up you will have moved 8 meters because of the way circles work
I probably going to ruin your whole day Austin but...




THE NETHER IS NOT ANOTHER PLANET, ITS ANOTHER DIMENSION!!
Thank you for your time.
Um wait. What if the nether is just underground and it works radially. That literally solves all the problems.
What if, every time we delete a Minecraft world it actually gets sucked in a black hole....

Earlier versions of Minecraft: Sorry, you can't teleport to this player because they are in another dimension.

The nether is a whole dimension, not a planet
The nether is supposed to represent the "hell" of the Minecraft world; not a second planet. The nether is below the classical Minecraft surface. (Somewhere under the bedrock layer.)

That explains both the nether portal‚Äôs potential as a very efficient traveling method and the "warping of space" occurring in the nether; wich are nothing but simple geometrical phenomenas caused by the (only theoretically existing) roundness of the Minecraft earth.

Oh, and thanks for assuming that I don‚Äòt understand physics that are slightly more complex than what you learn at secondary school!
I don't wanna burst your bubble, bro... But the Nether is a dimension, not a planet...
12:47 Uhhh‚Ä¶ That's not how exponents work

12:45 the math isn't right. You cant just remove a ^2 from every monomial
It would be E=c*‚àö(m^2*c^2+P)
You could just say that the nether is at the core of a spherical minecraft world, then you‚Äôd travel ‚Äúfaster‚Äù in the nether because the radius towards the center of the sphere is smaller, hence more circumference is traveled per step that you would at the surface of the sphere.
Austin:  makes elaborate video about how minecraft is in a black hole to explain the nether
comments section: im about to end this mans whole career
Nobody :

The game Theorist : draws a circle and refering it To Minecraft worlds
The nether is INSIDE the overworld! 

As you already pointed out in another video, minecraft is a spherical world with 125 million square kilometres surface area. To fit all that on a sphere it has to have a radius of about 100km 
If we had a coordinate grid that goes towards the world's centre, we could trace along the sides of one block in the nether and have 8 blocks on the outside (overworld) IF the nether is exactly 1/8 as far away from the core than the overworld, which makes 12.5km

Proof against your thesis of more speed/gravity of the overworld is the y axis. If we'd jump one block high in the nether, the y coordinate should change by 8 just like the others do on their respective directions. But it doesn't. One unit on the y axis is one meter. Everywhere. 

Maybe you think that there should be some noticeable curvature or something that makes the cubes no cubes, but even in the nether the upper side of a block is just .008% larger than the lower side. And I don't think anyone would notice such a microscopic difference
Nether is under normal wold's bedrock

The Nether is another dimension, not a planet, so the laws of physics may not apply in the nether.

Ok. First of all. We don't even know if:
The Minecraft planet is flat or round.
if the sun is round.
Is the Neather even a planet?
you are actually destroying the world everytime you use the Portal, but you don't notice because you're traveling to another dimension everytime
Geez, that brain not being normal was the most relatable thing I've ever heard.
Austin: here is a formula
Me: I don't understand
Austin: Oh let me change this to make it easier
Me: Nothing fuc*ing changed
1. The Nether is another universe, not another location within the same universe
2. Gravity doesn't affect most blocks, meaning the Minecraft world cannot orbit anything or really move in any way
3. Light is not a wave in Minecraft, it's a propagation of discreet values

What if the nether is just a system of rotating caves below the bedrock, rotating so that 1 nether second is 8 overwold seconds?
so the over world is going through space time compression, or can the nether b going through space time expansion (idk if thats a real thing I just reversed what u said and hoped that it would make logical sense)
I thought the nether was hell or a different dimension i guess not lol
Dude u know u can go in creative mode  right?
Minecraft:A normal, fun game

Austin:Hold my potion


Edit:OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LIKES
This made me think of a question... Could a sun possibly orbit a habitable planet?
The Minecraft is square just like your sun and it's also infinite
Well what if the minecraft world is really the middle of the solar system where the original planet of the player is the real sun and the moon is a planet. Since they are exactly 180 degrees from each other.
Also what if the nether is a planet scp like object in terms of physics and other things
The Nether is under/in (basically the core) the Minecraft overworld...



That means the Nether is just smaller so it would make you travel faster because the outside crust is 8x larger...
This was painful to watch. So many unfounded assumptions and leaps of logic.
GUYS! 
The Austin challenge(for minecraft):

Set world border to reduce to zero after 96 hours of playtime.
See how long you can survive in the nether from stockpiled resources!!!
sooooooo Can you build me a diamond pick axe or not ?
What if its inside the oversorld
So if you move one block it equates to 8 blocks due to its smaller sizr
Honestly, WHERE IS THE RICHEST VIDEO GAME CHARACTER?!
Or maybe the energy is somehow transferred from the portal into he alternate dimension that is the nether and that is why the explosions and lava already exist there. Because 8 seconds ago the entire place went caboom...
Hey Austin! Love the video but your formulas are from special relativity, not general relativity. Special relativity does not work when applied to accelerating objects such as orbiting bodies.

Looks like a math error, or am I wrong? Not that this one math error would disprove your point or anything.


sqrt(a^2 + b^2) != a+b
I always think the creators of games don't think about this stuff. They just wanted to make a game man, why ya got a give them so much presure? Nah, I love you guys :)
Despite what ppl say I enjoyed the theory it's always good to learn something new
Yeah yeah yeah the nether could be inside of the Minecraft Earth... ooorrrr the nether could be the warp... Praise the emperor! purge the heretics!
Roses are red 
Leaves are green 
This comment will get lost 
Don't forget meeeeeeeeeee
One problem the nether is a different dimension  not a planet and different dimensions have different properties
Mojang: "Hey what if we made a seperate dimension with a few different rules and like, i don't know, 1 block = 8 blocks for some reason?" "Haha sure"
Austin: "IT"S EINSTEIN, LIGHT WAVES, YOU"RE STRETCHING SPACE-TIME AND THE WORLD IS DOOMED"
But Austin, you are forgetting one crucial thing!








tHe NEtHeR iS A wHoLE OthEr DImeNTiON!!11!1!1111
Dear Austin...
Just saying... but what if the neather is actually just a sphere smaller than earth...

Imagine this the earth and the neather have the center in the exact same place. This gives us a small sphere (the neather) inside a bigger sphere (earth), imagine that the portal takes you downwards in a radial direction to the neather. If you walk a bit in the neather and then teleport back to earth (same rules as when teleporting to the neather, but instead of downwards you go upwards) you would in fact have covered a greater distance on earth than on the neather. 
Obviously you have to consider they have a similar angular velocity or that they don't spin at all, but I find this explanation a bit more satisfying and less complicated üòÖ. 
Hope you see this and give your opinion.

Sincerely not Austin
No one:
Austin: THE MINECRAFT SUN IS ACTUALLY A BLACK HOLE
Except for the nether is a different dimension, meaning it‚Äôs not in space (at least ours) and the only way to get there is with a portal. What if time works differently in the Nether‚Äôs dimension?
That's some royalty free music there bruh.

Is it just me or is minecraft making a comeback? No? Ok...
The Nether, the final frontier...
Oh wait thats the End

FUC-
If a flat earther played minecraft would they set it to super flat?
Sorry but... If you go thro the nether time dosent change It change the distance You walk and every block in the nether are 8 outside (the time is the same)
A different planet? You spelled dimension wrong
I thought the nether  was just basically a habitable  versions of hyperspace.
Orbital speed, radius? Come-on we all know the world is flat, right ;)
You, sir, never disappoint me
another question. if a player is coming back from the nether, (your on multiplayer) and another person is in the normal world, do you go back how many second were spent there? like traveling back it time?
But the nether isn't a planet , it's a whole other dimension, remember in like basically every minecon the creators always refer to the Nether as "The Nether Dimension"

EDIT: That's probably why compasses and clocks go haywire

other EDIT: Oh wow I've never gotten these many like tysm

Other other edit: I see people saying that it will still need a source of power for the portal, so in that case , the power for the portal will come from the Nether hence the reason why there is a portal on the other side + I know it is another dimension because if you get yourself on the other side of the bedrock the sky is red and there is no sign of other planets , the sun, and no moon , reason?if  The Nether was a construct of some type of self heating material then over hundreds of thousands of years would it would probably become a supernova which therefore means it is a dimension on it's own and not a planet considering it has already been around for hundreds of thousands of years and to support that timeline, there is life in the nether which would've taken millions and millions of years to develop.
i honestly live for these science videos!
Someone give this man a medal of honor
For as wrong as the theory is it would be cool if there was a mod where you had to try to get to the nether before the overworld was sucked into a black hole
OR... the nether portal makes you 8x larger when you pass through it?
"Whatever way you're thinking is wrong."
Great, the public school system is back to harass me again...
Let this boggle around your brain for a bit...
CERN is the IRL nether portal to hell/hel
How in 10 years has no one solved what the text at the end of Minecraft meant?
Yea, no. It's just underground.
"DAMMIT A BLACKHOLE AGAIN!" 

Man I love this episode.
what if the nether was just inside the Minecraft Earth.
Ah. I see. You made a useless theory. Again. It's a Dimension, btw.
I watched my worlds disappear 


It was a black hole-
Did some say DOOM? Heavy metal starts playing
Minecraft people can phase through each other

Explain this things please
Keep it up with the minecraft.




I feel the need for my true childhood ruined
E^2=(mc^2)^2+PC^2 equals
E=sqrt((mc^2)^2+PC^2). First you solve everything under the root and then you calculate its root for the final result. mc^2+sqrt(P)C is incorrect result because when you square it, the result isn't (mc^2)^2+PC^2, the result is then (mc^2)^2+2m(c^2)*C*sqrt(P)+PC^2.
It's simpler:
The Nether is subterrean. The radius of this "world" is minor than the overworld's.
So, you can travel faster.
The game thereoist are on mental drugs
All the people saying ‚Äúnether is underground‚Äù imma give you the biggest problem with that theory using your own logic.

In the regular world in Minecraft, you can dig all the way down to bedrock.. so if you dig that far you will be very far below the surface and ‚Äúdecreasing‚Äù the distance between you and the centre of the planet. You can also build straight up to the building limit of 255 blocks above bedrock.

So by the plague of ‚Äúcircle logic‚Äù you should be able to dig to bedrock at the compass origin: 0,0 (ignores vertical/Y-axis) and end up at the coordinates 0,0,0. Then you would travel north to coordinates 0,0,5 (I can‚Äôt remember which axes go which directions so let‚Äôs assume that North is + on the z-axis), then build straight up to the build limit of 255 (like the ‚Äúelevator‚Äù that some people plead is what nether portals are) and end up at coordinates 0,255,(5+n) where n is the additional distance you traveled away from compass origin based on the relative circumference of the lower bedrock limit to the upper build limit. But that doesn‚Äôt happen, you will be at 0,255,5 and your z-axis will be completely unchanged from when you were at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of the elevator. Even if you repeat this process but travel 1 000 000 blocks north the 1/4 kilometre ascent doesn‚Äôt translate to ANY relative difference at the top of the minecraft build limit. You will still be 1 000 000 blocks (metres) away from the compass origin.

Unfortunately this inner/outer circle theory is the ‚Äúeasy way out‚Äù for a concept that Austin very creatively explained while also spreading knowledge to people about quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.
Maybe the nether is faster than the overworld
Hey SCIENCE can you make a vid. on a Mass Effect?
0:51 he used the reboot. I‚Äôm disappointed
HI, IT‚ÄôS ME! AUSTIN!




...okay I‚Äôm good. ü•∫
Austin: the nether is another planet.
Me: isn't the nether supposed to be under the overworld, due to the nether being a representation of the Underworld?
Wait I thought MatPat did Game Theor- this is another channel isn't it -_-

Edit: ok so yeah I thought MattPat did Game Theory
GOD JUST GET THAT SUN FIXED
AUSTIN!!! You should do how powerful are warios farts
You've played The Russian Front haven't you?
You're forgetting that the nether is considered a different dimension
Thumbnail: Mr. Persson I don't feel so good
so 1 portal needs EVERY NUKE to even be opened??? 0_O
why did you just automatically assume the nether is a separate planet? dumb
Why can‚Äôt we just enjoy a game for once






Yeah.....no......that‚Äôs impossible
Only one thing is more dangerous though:

Wait a second, the overworld is 8 times bigger than the earth.
The nether is 1/8th the size of the overworld.
So does that mean that earth = the nether?

Edit:NOPE
Austin: Every second you spend in the nether, 8 seconds pass in the normal world.

Me: 1 word:





Multiplayer
Why would you use a gravitational formula in a world where you can make floating cities. The minecraft universe is different to ours, that means all our universal constants and theorems are not the same.

Nice try but your theory is standing on a loose foundation.
You know what's creepy?
This was really fun to watch.
Also Charlie Day at 11:46
Comments: I'm about to destroy this mans whole career

Ok but what if the nether is just the future of the minecraft world.... sorry Austin lol
1/8 is half of a quarter. (1/4)^2 would be 1/16.
Game theorys always turn into Science class
This sounded almost like Scott Lang in Endgame :v
The neather is a dimension not a planet. It exsit between space and time, if you take out a clock it goes haywire.
What about a Geocentric model?
An infinite overworld converting to a deeper underground space.
The Nether is a different realm where space time has already collapsed. The for being called hell. But still good video.
12:45
So if a¬≤=b¬≤+c¬≤, then a=b+c (FYI, this is wrong). Dude, please get the math equations right lol üòÇüòÇ
The nether biome in game is literally called "hell" biome

Hell=Hades


Percy jackson walked down a staircase to Hades at one point and then took a elevator down to it in another book


Hell is sorta just considered instinctively to be underground

Have you considered that the nether might be a low part of the Minecraft mantle, and that the nether Portal exists to pass through bedrock



However the closer you are to a planet's core, the lesser the gravity would be (if the planet is hollow like this theory requires it to be) considering gravity in the nether Is normal, the nether Is most likely directly below the normal bedrock of the overworld. If you try to factor in the "red void" above the nether and the "black void" below the overworld, you need to realize one thing: you aren't actually supposed to be past bedrock so empty space above nether bedrock and below overworld bedrock makes sense. Having the overworld exist above the nether and the nether exist below the overworld would cause lag on low end systems. 
Tell me what you think. Is this feasible? Does it cover all the bases? Let me know in the comments below! 

(Totally didn't practice YouTuber commentary there)
1% Of comments.
‚ÄúWow, what a reasonable theory!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Nether is under bedrock.‚Äù
Minecraft:A normal, fun game

Austin:Hold my potion
I was going to debate against this but the comments section has already done that quite sufficiently...
The reality bending theory sounds interesting but it can be disproved
You only forgot one thing, matpat figured out in a very old Minecraft video that the Minecraft world is geocentric. So the Minecraft world can't orbit around anything
The Nether isn't another place though, the nether is a completely separate dimension .-.
dude its under the earth. that‚Äôs why the ‚Äúceiling‚Äù is bedrock

It‚Äôs funny how Austin is trying to use the concept of gravity to explain a game where blocks of pure gold can float in mid-air

Edit: Thanks for 100 likes comrades
so minecraft is the legend of zelda majora's mask now?
I never thought I would watch a Minecraft video talking about Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity
Haha I liked that intro
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HERE THE WORDS MINECRAFT AND EINSTEIN IN THE SAME SENTENCE
I thought the Nether was the Overworld's core.
And the Minecraft world has magic so......
The nether is underground, not it's own planet. Hence, nether.
But what if it worked like Cowboy Bebop?
This is amazing. Love this %#&@ so much.
Fun theory, but only works if Nether is another planet. And it isn't.
but lava flows way faster in the nether tho :/
I like how there are no comments like "BUBBLES, BLOSSOM, AND B-" or "NEITHER, THE FINAL FRONTIER. OH WAIT THAT THE END FU- ". Like come on guys.
Minecraft: Exists


Overworld: I am speed
Minecraft: You can (not) build.
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE
Since minecraft is proven to be a spherecal world, what if there are two spheres, one nether sphere within the larger overworld sphere, being closer to the center of a circle means less distance travelled and every time a nether portal is used, you just go up or down?
Like some other comments I saw, i totally agree. Some of you guys at being so rude. Imagine how many HOURS and HOURS Austin had to spend on this theory and then  here are some people just tearing it up. Disgusting.
Wait only nether portals bothered him??
I thought after playing Minecraft the first thing he would tackle is why some blocks float...
the answer is quite simple and literally puts everything u just did to waste

the laws of this universe doesn't work in the minecraft universe
he just invented a new type of challenge for minecraft players to try
Minecraft: We‚Äôre just an innocent, simple game

Austin: Hold my beer
And on the 9th day, the sun never rose in the morning.
And the thought on everyone's mind travelled through the air.
Those 5 words.
"We're in the endgame now."
What if instead minecraft uses diffrent reflectivity, or a completely diffrent physics?
E=mc (squared)
E= MineCraft (squared)
problems:
1)Time in over wold and mine craft is 1 to 1
2) Mine craft is flat and infinite.
3) The nether is another is another dimension.  
4) Just no.
YouTubers: This is gonna be a 8 part series

3 Videos later: only part 1 has been released
What if the nerther is just smaller and when you come back its kinda realitve

Thats was definitely stupid i just woke up
omg, this was just so epic, dude, you rock
It doesn't doom the Minecraft world if you subscribe to the same theory I do:  The Nether is the MANTLE of the Minecraft world, around halfway to the core.  Half the radius, one EIGHTH the circumference!  Nether portals are just that, portals.
Quickest a swear has ever come up in one of your videos congrats!
What if they‚Äôre just spheres and the overworld‚Äôs radius is just 8 times larger than that of the nether‚Äôs
Austin: the nether is another planet orbiting the same sun
Me: but isn't the nether from an another dimension?
Rage 2 black hole ability plz
All of the below, plus... isn't everything having to do with the nether supposed to be unholy magic nonsense? The portals can work however they want.
You should do math on Earth and the quantum realm for endgame!
YOU WANT DESERT TEMPLES? 
WE GOTTEM.
YOU WANT NEW ENTITIES? 
WE GOT YOU COVERED BABY!
Or the nether is closer to the middle of the earth then the surface
This made me compare the nether to the warp from warhammer 40k
One key feature you are missing.



 There's are theory that earth is massive and the sun and moon are orbiting it
OR.


The nether is either inside the planet, and the radius of the nether is 1/8th the radius of the surface


OR


The nether is an alternate reality, and so follows wacky warping rules
What happened to the old intro? Y'know...the
"HEY! It's me! AUSTIN!
When I started watching Stranger Things, it reminded me so much of the Nether and Minecraft in general somehow. Like with the portals, the other dimension, like the Upside Down in ST
Isnt... The nether... Literally hell.... Not a planet?
pffff you are all dum the Minecraft world is infinite DID YOU FORGET THAT
You should know that ADHD is not an indication to take Zoloft
Mat Pat: Hey Austin, want to do an episode of game theory?

Austin: sure I‚Äôll do a minecraft theory

Mat Pat: we‚Äôve already done minecraft theor...

Austin: how about the nether!
Austin: Which ever way u think it‚Äôs gonna kill us, your wrong. 
Me: It‚Äôs a black hole
Guys i think Austin is drunk again.
Or maybe the blocks are bigger in the nether. Perspective too
My guy the neather is just underground and it‚Äôs so deep that the radius of the neather is 1/8 the radius of the surface obviously
Well for me it's better than fortnite now...

then again isn't everything
i was thinking about hosting a realms server for me and my mates, guess were gonna have to complete the game in 4 days...
Nice calculations butthe nether is near the core of the minecraft world
So... you can bend space time with Java?
I will make it easier for you, its just BLACK HOLE
I always assumed the nether was the core of The Minecraft world
I always assumed that it wasn't the Nether's fault but the portal itself which has some sort world traveling of spatial lag... Yeah.
hey mat i heard my friend went over to see you and....




can i borrow one of your chairs?
1 in game day = 20 mins
God, I love the music in this. Barber of Seville, dance of the hours, sorcerer‚Äôs apprentice, night on bald mountain, they‚Äôre all so good!
Wait a minute, MATPAT said Minecraft was a geocentric solar system, therefore we have to do more maths.
Ahh I can live with it. Great theory
I‚Äôve discovered that a TNT cannon of 144 primed TNT is 3/5th the power of the tsar bomba. Could you do the science of that?

Or u know...the circumference is smaller underground
To much talking
I love these videos. Its always fun trying to comprehend science i hardly know for games i love. (Also, i love imagining that if Mat needs help, he just comes to you) Keep it up Austin!
Is-isn't nether a different dimension  where it's far away from overworld?
Butttt Spacetime is an illusion.
That's how Quantum Entanglement is possible...
But no one is supposed to know this yet...
Enjoy the causality violation c:
Austin, you need to calm down. It's time to take a step back & cool down.
& this is coming from a fan of yours who really likes it when you say: "God damn terrifying!"
but isn't he/she a god (steve/alex)?
Well, the Nether could be under the Overworld and if that's the case and assuming that the minecraft Earth isn't flat but spherical then having to walk less in the nether for more distance in the Overworld makes a lot of sence due to how circles/spheres work üòÇ
problem: you're using gravity to prove something about a game that doesn't always do gravity.
Didn‚Äôt this channel prove before how the minecraft planet didn‚Äôt orbit around anything
15:04 thanks for the nightmare fuel.
‚ÄúSchwarzschild‚Äù




Black holes?
Actually, if the black hole is rotating (which is likely because of conservation of angular momentum) it can enter the ergosphere and orbit there. A few conditions would be whether the ergosphere is big enough which would involve a black hole spinning fast enough and would involve it orbiting in the same direction that the black hole is spinning.
i just realized,that guy doing the far lands or bust could travel a lot faster to the far lands using the nether.
12:44 ummm... 
If a^2 = b^2 + c^2.. 
then it does not means a = b + c
Energy equals Minecraft cake square d
what if the portal just makes the world around you bigger
Your channel is like:
If video games used the rules of the universe
WHERE IS MATPAT??!
thumbnail be like 

mr enderman i dont feel so good
So minecraft is basically legend of zelda majoras mask but not exactly
Plus There is No Intro
Imagine if this is actually what notch was thinking when he designed the nether portal
But what if its a dimensional thing like in one dimension Time travels 8x faster in that whole universe
what if the nether is just under the normal world but so close to the core of the planet that the circumference of the nether would be 1/8 that of the overworld, making everything work out just fine.
What about...




Pether Nortals?
We need a mod of this
Couldn't the nether "planet" just be 1/8 the size of the main world, and the portal just travels to the same spherical coordinates?
Yay I was actually partly correct in my theory!
!Question what about the nether being half the mass of the over world. I think there is a major difference in the block ceiling of the nether!

just to make Austins brain melt
Not gonna lie bro I didn't understand about 90% of this video.
Mojang: lets make a new dimension and a cool boss! I will call that nether! (God it wil be so cool boys)
Some people: Nether is a planet which is called hell u know and mojang wanted to create space rockets but they decided to make iteven more epic so they made portals wow its so amazing boys my theory rules
Doesn't this whole theory hinge on the Nether being another planet in the same universe?

Austin, I hate to tell you, but you might wabt to read the Minecraft manual/wiki. It's an entirely seperate universe.
The new frontier wink wink 
New phone who dis ???
But Austin, what if they just measure differently? :p
Or how about their in different planes of existance? They both are at the same place but at different dimensions

Austin: Gets depressed
Minecrafters: What have we done?!
I got a Minecraft ad before this video
what if... minecraft physics... are different? WHAT IF... the minecraft... universe physics... are differente?
He is overthinking this, the neither is underground. and because the earth is round...

you teleport downwards


which comes closer together.


Come on dude
Alternate theory!!!
Nether is 8 times smaller then the overworld

And the portals calculate the relative position in the overworld
I dunno...

Call me a sceptic, but I think, that this is a bit like going across the river, to reach the well.

I've always considered the nether to be the center of the planet, in which minecraft exists.

A portal sends you straight down to hell, you walk a small distance, and another portal sends you straight up.
Maybe, 
Actually overworld contain a black hole.
And bedrock sustain the overworld
I was happy with the idea that the Nether was hell under the surface of the overworld and you got there by magic
make a video when you know the subject we are talking about sir adhd.
The nether is under minecraft not above it in space.
Meaning we are talking about geography and simple mathematics and not astronomy and einstein's theory of general relativity, which for some reason you think has to be used for everything to explain anything in everyday life .
so, Austin that was nice but 
where is part 2 of the Richest Video Game Characters???  hmmmmmmmm?
Wait isn't the nether underneath  the surface and the mine craft universe is a globe might be wrong
Why do so many YouTubers & People confuse the word Orbit with the word Rotate!!
Planets ORBIT a star, But they Rotate around a Central access creating a day/night cycle.

Nothing in this universe rotates around a star!!!!!!!
The planet the mine craft sun is orbiting if this throws is true could be a white dwarf or another dwarf out of the many
But, all of this rides in the assumption that the nether is a different planet which, it simply isn't. The nether as well as the end are explicitly stated as different dimensions; granted traveling between dimensions like this probably wouldn't be good either and I even think that that would have been a better episode than whatever this was. 


Sorry for the rant
...but the overworld and the nether aren't planets, they are dimensions...
Ah! Circles! My eyes!
I know everyone has already taken a turn at tearing this apart but, Just considering his ideas, wouldn't the nether planet be closer to the sun since high levels of gravity can bend spacetime to match that of traveling near speeds of light? being close to a black hole would be equivalent to moving near the speed of light and then that just transfers over. Going faster means time goes by slower for you, which checks out if each time was measured in distance as I believe he was trying for, the faster moving planet should be the one with the slower time. 



TLDR: He has his planets switched
If the nether was under the overworld then he could do a theory about how huge the planet has to be for there to be no detcetable curvature of the surfaces in either the overworld or the nether!
Explain to us how the lava gets to the nether
Nether isn't a diferent planet - it's a dimension or it's the underworld of the overworld. So yeah...
That's awesome but what map size did you use?.......
I remember mining through the roof of the nether and saw bedrock and I was like ‚ÄúTF?‚Äù
Or the nether is underneath and 1/8th the circumference...
Go home game theory, you're drunk.
The Nether is under bedrock
Overworld is above bedrock
Nether is hell
Hell is associated as an "under" world

Nether is under overworld as a core, time is slower in the core because of electromagnetic orbit length width cube core stuff
This, like almost any other SCIENCE episode here, is terrifying if it were real
What if the end was in the black hole.  That would make more sense why it just darkness.
I'm just going to go ahead and make this worse for everybody by bringing -ring-ularities, frame dragging, and non-planitoid life bearing structures into the picture; i wonder if it would be possibly to buld something like a ring world around a black hole, for instance.

Have fun with the math for that one.
Can we all aknowledge the fact Austin made a Austin powers reference?
You made a mistake at 12:46: E^2=m^2c^4+p^2c^2 and square roots don't work like that. I'm a physicist, I would love to proof read your scripts
What about the END HMMMMM!?!?
You're overthinking it, man.
God, I love astronomy!
You could just use the same principles as an Alcubierre drive
‚ÄúTHE SCIENCE‚Äù is just what game theory was originally
11:34
I been playing Minecraft for 13d 23h 35m
Monsters killed: 2591
Blocked broken: 70755
Distance travelled: 3594897
uh, Austin, isn't the nether supposed to be the "underworld" A.K.A. under the planet's overworld.  Couldn't you just explain this away with circumference math of two spheres that exist inside each other?
Ye so I tested this and my world is still fine after 92 hours
Or simply if the nether was underground closer to the core of the world it would make sense the if it took less time if the portal acted as say an elevator
Endgame spoiler: 







Ok, listen here, I'm not gonna spoil Endgame, and if anyone does, dies in the most cruel way possible
Austin, Austin, Austin.  

If i had a nickel for each second that you spent on formulas that you didnt need to use because you had the wrong assumption that the nether was a planet and going to the nether changes time and space, I could probably buy minecraft from microsoft.
unless the portal stretches the player character by 8 times
I like trapping people in a portal on creative and then getting banned
can i get your playlist? i love those classic music theams!
Minecraft: only 10 years old
TGT: im obessed with the nether
Me: wait thats illegal
take a shot everytime he said "utterly"
‚ÄúWHATEVER WAY YOURE THINKING THATS NOT IT!!!‚Äù
‚Äúit probably has to do with nether/overworld distances bending reality.‚Äù
‚ÄúITS BECAUSE NETHER/OVERWORLD DISTANCES BEND REALITY!‚Äù

so... does that mean you distrust your own theory?
Hey but if the speed of light was different there
its a fricken VIDEO GAME
1:54

Wait thats illegal

The planets and stars should be square
Dude, the nether isn't a planet, it's hell. These rules don't follow.
I thought this was gonna be about infinity war at first glance ngl
You used time dilatation for a length contraction effect Austin. That's an understandable mistake, but might change your whole planetary nether theory
But why are Nether portals vertical but end portals are horizontal?
No one:

Austin: You will understand Einstein‚Äôs law of general and special relativity a lot better
And that means maybe you been in a black hole but just restored and Reseted it self
But Austin, have you stopped to consider this:

The Minecraft world is round, yes? And the lowest layer you can dig to is bedrock. The highest level you can dig to in the Nether is also bedrock. 

What if the Nether is simply the core of the planet. This would explain the dilation in blocks traveled.

Right?
Clocks don't work in the nether :P
What is the music in the beginning???
Uh. Problem. The Nether isn't a different planet, and it's probably just radial.
Did anyone else cringe when dealing with the full E=mc^2 equation when he square rooted over addition on the right side (which you can‚Äôt do)
And then you wake up then you can play again and again and again maybe that‚Äôs also why the world reset it self to begin to play again
it could just make everything bigger including steve
"Demoleculalized" yeah I caught that. Teehee. (demolecularize) just giving you a hard time bud. Let Austin curse damn you!!
im an astronomy major, so i know what hes talking about...BUT

the nether is a dimension under the overworld soo...ye
wait... I thought it was 1=8 because it‚Äòs closer to the core of the minecraft earth, which is why you get to another place faster juat like... the solar system. the closer you are to the sun, the faster you get around the sun. Same with a race that has a turn. closer to the center of the curve = faster...

walking one block in the nether is eight blocks in the overworld since (seen from the same height as in the overworld, so you keep the system of the portals, which is hard to keep up on it‚Äòs own. 

Meaning: 

nether blocks = nb
overworld blocks = ob
normal height = nh

255 is the max height that you can build to, 63-64 is the usual height that you‚Äòre at in the world (when building the portal / spawnpoint)

8ob=1nb idk why because I‚Äòm just writing this while sitting in college.

I stand for it. The nether is hell, religion and the greeks say hell is below the ground, meaning that it fits to MC as well... i guess... this does confirm that the minecraft earth is flat and round at the same time. Flatroundearthers combine
lol running out of content so now you got to bring science into minecraft still love you tho!!
The beginning music is aquarium from carnival of the animals
So basically when people say ‚Äúa portal to another world‚Äù. Austin took that as being transported to another planet. 
So uh... no.
Notice how he said sincerely Austin but didn't start the episode with a letter. Oopsies
Hey, Austin, I'm kinda curious if this idea would work basing off the speed at which the planet is rotating, though I'm not too sure what would happen to a being on a planet rotating so quickly that the person on it would be basically traveling just shy of the speed of light.
I only have 1 problem with this theory. You already (in an older video) said that Minecraft's planet is the center of the "solar" system. Which you established when you showed why the MC planet is round.
How did you go from 8 blocks is one step in the nether to the time being slower? And if the nether is deep underground then yeah one step would equal steps on the surface its common sense. So whyd you make this video?
minecraft is flat earth and has a dome protecting it from everything
Cats say "meow."
Dogs say "bark."
Birds say "chirp."
Idiots say "first."
(Important edit!)

Edit: thank you to those who have realized that this is NOT an original comment. I was just curious if this comment would be successful. And sadly, it was. I'm thankful for the likes, however. But, likes are what comments like these are aiming towards. The next time you see a comment like this, don't like it. It gives them the satisfaction.
Steve, I don‚Äôt feel so good
This, would make a GREAT minecraft challenge
I always thought the nether was just an intertwined dimension
Couldn‚Äôt it just be closer to the center of the earth means the circumference and surface area would be smaller making it faster to circle the nether because it is smaller

Also even if the world of Minecraft was infinite 
infinity/8 still is infinity so It could work it would just be stupid
12:48 So, you want to say the MineCraft^2 added to root of my PC would equal pure energy?
You can probably work this theory with the game with the End being that black hole your talking about or something idk it 1 am
if all these formulas whould bo correct,then way isnt this doom cernario ever playing out :p
I thought The Nether was underneath the normal Minecraft and that why it's faster.
But Minecraft has unlimited energy. A coal and a stick make a torch that burns literaly forever.
I find it hilarious people are getting triggered over this video
You didn't factor in that the playable space alone is 7+ times the size of Earth!
What if the nether is the core of the Earth and portals are kind of just elevators
Imagine the nether portal consuming the world in order to send you to the nether and then spitting you out in a different timeline.
Are we still talking about the game WITH FLOATING TREES
could it be 5 or higher dimensional model with relativistic curvatures, essentially contracting the 4-dimensional space-time in of the Overworld which is in parallel with the Nether's 4-dimensional space-time?
why not get someone to program a mod to make this and other theories into gameplay mechanics
You should not conflate time and distance.
in hell time left the server. and when you play minecraft to long
Hes complaining because of teleportation yet a human (steve) can carry the hole universe as he confirmed
my favorite part is when austin comes to a big climax conclusion and the classical music gets intense
I was expecting a theory about how the nether isn't a stable planetary mantle or something about the Minecraft planets core but yet here we are.
I freaking love Austin I swear he‚Äôs better than MatPat #changemymind
bro calm down its a block game lmao
Well for me it's better than fortnite now...

then again isn't everything
I‚Äôm a kid not a scientist ü•º
I feel so sorry for Austin. He spent hours on the script, calculations, and video.
But forgot that the Nether isn‚Äôt a planet.
you didn't start it in the letter format :(
Wonder if einstein would like if your using his knowledge for this
Dear Austin,

In 12:44 I shall remember you that the square root of a¬≤+b¬≤ is not a+b.
BUTTERS BUTTERCUP AND BLOSSOM
So in terms of all of this, is the singularity of the black hole the End???
Or Minecraft could just be another galaxy where time and space and energy all work differently and the nether would make perfect sense.
0:31 was that an austin powers reference? lol
But what if the nether is a dimension, Not a Planet.
can you do a theory about Prey?
I just watch it to entertain myself. shrugs
My geuss without watching the video is that hes going to talk about how in the nether one block there is eight blocks in the overworld and how this bends spacetime and could break the galaxy

Edit: i geuss im somewhat right
... I think your formulas are wrong ... cause there is the Photosphere where ... way above the Schwarzschild radius / event horizon  the orbital speed is exactly the speed of light.  ... so no need to in that to reach 99.something % speed of light ... though the closest stable orbit is 3 times that size.
Eh, I think you just became larger when you enter the nether.
As a self proclaimed veteran of Minecraft I have to inform you since the nether is a separate dimension properties and size can become different.
Lets take the tardis from doctor who.
Its a big box inside a small box, expanding itself in a pocket dimension.
In conclusion.
Minecraft has a bunch of wibbly wobbly timey whimey.. Stuff too.
Or... you know... the nether could be meant to represent the Minecraft planet‚Äôs core (under the bedrock) which would explain the travel distance difference. I know that this requires assuming that the planet is round, which it isn‚Äôt. But it makes more sense to me, I dunno.
Why you bully minecraft?
Why can‚Äôt y‚Äôall just be nice to a guy trying to teach science in a way our simple gamer minds can comprehend?
sqrt(a+b) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) ? Huh, Austin ? Maths don't work that way.
Or the Nether is on the same round planet, but underground.
Nether is the same planet
Your entire rant goes on the idea that Steve travels 1 m/ps which is incorrect. It's actually 2.3 m/ps , so for every second of travel in the nether you travel 17.4 meters on the vanilla world. And given the fact that the vanilla Minecraft world is an infinite body , the sun is orbiting around us. So your heliocentric theory here can't physically work. Try quantum physics, instead of assuming that the nether is its own celestial body. String theory and yadda yadda. Basically, the portal disassembled your particles and holds them together within the fabric of space time during your nether visit.
You can spot a minecraft normie from the start...
Austin: it's not what your thinking
Me: it's a black hole
Austin: what?
Me: your going to say it's a black hole
Austin: how did you--
Me: I KNOW YOU.
I like the music like night on bald mountain
Could it not just be that the nether world has a larger circumference and therefore the work used to go one block is equal to that of 8 blocks on earth
Nice :}
I just had a thought, what if you grew 8x your height when you go into the nether and √∑8 when you leave
Austin explaining theory:
Me: Why is the sun square?
Did he just saw shrwartzchilled?
I always figured the never and end where entirely different detentions. like the fay wilds in DnD
this could be turned into a great hardcore minecraft modpack
Autist tries to explain how minecraft 2 will be out soon
Me: 11 views!!! I‚Äôm in the first 15 views!!!


YouTube: NOPE!!! 915 likes!!!! laughs evilly
I think the idea was that the nether is inside the center of the Minecraft world (hence why it has a roof that lava pours through) and you're using portals to travel vertically through the world straight up and down between surfaces. 
Even though everything is square, if represented as a circle, when you walk 1 meter in the center of the world, you'd have to walk an equivalent 8 meters on the surface to match that (I'm assuming due to the exaggerated curvature of the planet on the surface as compared to the core.)
Now, this does mean that the Minecraft work would have to be pretty dang big, and the gravity experienced in the nether would be huge, but hey, details.
hey all you mod makers, i have an idea
That ending tho ü§£
Why does the clock and the map do that thing tho
ok but why was that last line so raw
Dear Austin,


Let's get straight to the point.


 Wrong wrong wrong. Not the only way.
Theory 1: Minecraft's world is round,  a nether portal teleports the user closer to the core of the world. Walking 8 meters in the overworld would transport you x radians from the center of the planet while walking 1 meter in the nether would transport you also x radians from the center of the planet. I believe you can figure the rest out, I'm too lazy to continue writing.


Theory 2: The nether is another dimension and the world is in a 4d plane of which we can only interact with 3 at a time. The nether portal is just a wormhole between the overworld and the nether, which are both in the same four dimensional plane, althrough the nether is just 1/8th of the size. The wormhole wouldn't need that much energy.


ALSO:  The nether's time passes at the same time as the overworld, proven because if a player goes to the nether and another stays in the overworld, the player that comes back from the nether will have aged the same as the one in the overworld. If a player is in the nether and another one is in the overworld, the player in the overworld can thrown an apple through the portal and the player in the nether would instantly receive it, and vic-versa. Time passes equally. The wormhole could actually need no energy, since it would just be a breach between two places infinitesimally close to eachother in the fourth dimension.


ALSO:  It's the nether DIMENSION or Underworld not the nether planet. It could be the underworld of another planet, and I would let it pass if the time in the nether and the time in the overworld was different, but it isn't. It's EXACTLY the same.


ALSO:  Cant accept that. If the Overworld was orbiting around the sun orbiting a black hole, then on the cycle where the Overworld is between the sun and the blackhole, the blackhole's pull would dislodge it from the sun's orbital field. If it wasn't cycling around the sun, then there wouldn't be night in minecraft and that would nullify the theory, since the overworld does have a day/night cycle.


There is an easier way to doom the overworld with the nether portal though.


The nether should be VERY hot, given there is more lava and fire, so the difference in pressure should be INMENSE, and the levels of CO2 in the nether should be also terribly high. Opening a portal to the nether would basically allow the overworld's climate to change drastically and even worse if there are two or more. I won't do the math tho, you might be able to figure it out by itself.


-Sincerely, Kiroto.
Hey... Literally Minecraft is another completly new world.... Why don't we make it's own physics?
Wait..
Does that mean we only have like 80 minutes to get to the nether and get everything you need from the overworld to survive for the rest of your life without being ripped apart by a black hole?
Because a cycle last I checked was like 20 minutes.
ok austin, the fact that there is "liquid hot magma" and that your name is also Austin, AND that there are no "lasers" doesnt change the fact that it was an awesome Dr. Evil quote
......but didnt you prove that the sun orbits the earth in minecraft?
Or ya know, the nether is in the center of the earth explaining the bedrock ceiling and the molten sea.
What if nether portal just builds itself, say, kilometer straight down into underground lava cave systems and that's how other portal pops up 8x further - because in Nether you travel on a smaller globe (I know Minecraft world ain't exactly globe friendly but just assume) No disaster then eh?
Nether is not a plant it is under bedrock if you dig up you find bedrock
A^2+B^2=C^2 doesn't mean that A+B=C. Your equation for the energy is wrong.
The first part might be the best part for me
So, here is my theory, no math needed, only logic. The overworld and the nether are on earth, how we know that? You remember that layer of bedrock at the bottom of the overworld? There is a same layer of bedrock at the top of the nether. So what do the portals do? They transport you under that layer of bedrock, nearer to the center of the planet, at a place that the radius and the perimeter are 1\8 of what it is at the surface. So when you move in the nether and go up to the surface again, you have traveled 8 times the original distance you traveled cause you are closer to the center of the sphere that is earth. 
Sincerely, 
Nixodian




P.S. I can't show images to make what I mean easier understandable but I hope you understand
Time isnt different between the nether and the overworld time doesn't move at a different rate for characters in either.
So all of this video is wrong.
Or like, its deeper so going 1m near the core is equal to 8m on the surface. Guess thats not good clickbait though.
I always assumed that lore-wise the Nether was supposed to be underneath the bedrock of the Overworld, so you travel further because it's closer to the center of the planet.
I'm pretty sure that it is a dimensional shift, not a spatial one. Meaning that it could just be a new definition for space time. And I think that we use resonance jumps (it's a theory that by changing your resonance you are pulled to the universe that resonates on that frequency)
At 12:44 you are basically saying that 
squareroot(a+b)= squareroot(a)+squareroot(b)

It is false
it's time to stop and get help.
2 issues I have are that you assume the minecraft world has a real life like solar system, and that there has been no mention of how the moon and sun are always parallel to eachother
All of Austins minecraft theories have critical flaws. For example, when he claimed endermen don‚Äôt teleport he didn‚Äôt test to see if they can phase through blocks, which of course they can.
And here, the nether is not a planet, it‚Äôs a parralel dimention to minecraft taking up the same space, which austin would know if had spent more than 2 minutes googling how to make a nether portal.
I thought this was from mobs invading the overworld
I mean if the nether is under the overworld, and both are spheres, then it would explain the 8:1 distance issues. As for time.... well sleeping there can kill you so....
or the nether is 8 times larger.
What if the nether portal is drawing energy from the black hole itself, preventing the overworld from being pulled in?
Hey austin make a video about minecraft ender chest paradox plz
What if you bring a "block" back from the neather
Is he really just yelling around ?.. man...
This would be an awesome mod for minecraft tbh.
Wait but-the nether is a completely different world then the over world-what if instead of literally bending space time, it just sends you to the same point in each world just on different sized spheres 
Also-I‚Äôm pretty sure that literally changing space time means your assuming both worlds are the same size when in reality theres is no possible way to measure the radius of these worlds so chances are that the nether world is just 4 times smaller then the over world 
Either way, Awesome video man-keep up the good work
What if the nether is just part of the Minecraft world but it is in the planet's core so if you move a little bit  in it, you move more in the sphere's surface.
A time dilation of 8x is not the same thing as "8 seconds behind".
Yeah... this is why I don't watch game theory anymore. :1
That is why minecraft is a cube
Ha Austin powers reference 0:32
Nether, the final frontier.. Oh wait thats The End.

FU-
already loving this
This is all assuming that A: The nether and overworld exist on the same physical plane, and B: that time passes faster in the nether, neither of which are implied by the game. A fascinating theory none the less, though.
What if the nether exists outside of local spacetime.
Yep Minecraft is doomed
Liquid Hot Magma





What
Literally Any Video Game Character:
Austin: YOU SHOULD BE DEAD
Did you take into account that you used the relativity towards the over world, perhaps the Nether just moves extremely slow compared to the over world, or is extremely less dense. It doesn't have to be the over world just beding space, it can be the Nether having so much less, energy it's just not having enough to make time feel nearly as fast. And thus the 8 seconds aren't more, but the 1/8th of a second being less.
Who would have thought opening a portal to literal Hell would end the world.
Sience in minecraft? Thats where you go wrong
Minecraft in every update draws us nearer to the mystery of 11 and 13
11- Running sounds of an exhausted man
13- Bells
Bells are added in minecraft on the villager update and what's under a village is a stronghold and a stronghold has an end portal
You wouldn't not get tired lost finding a stronghold

Minecraft 1.11 update- Where the devs gives us a peek of the illagers and other stuff specially the woodland mansion and ofcourse who doesnt like to raid a mansion?

Minecraft PE/w10E 1.11 update- The village and pillage update which introduces w10 and mobile players to more intelligent npcs
and yes (bells) which tells us that there is a raid ongoing in the scene.

That's all i can provide from now

I still don't know what to do with the heart of the sea
‚Äùthe Nether, the final frontier....oh wait that‚Äôs the end, FU-‚Äú

I laughed so hard my drink came through my nose
But this is just a theory....
A gay theory!
The formula at 12:47 can't be right m8, you square rooted different addends of an equation like they were factors of a multiplication
The thumbnail dont feel so good
If the Minecraft world is infinite how does the sun go around it
I suppose a thing.
The nether is under the bedrock at a distance proportionnal of 8.
He knows it's a videogame, right?
This is one of the first Game Theory videos I've watched since 2014
If the Minecraft world is technically spherical then wouldn't it make more sense for the nether to be under bedrock... it would make sense why you move so much in the overworld. Angles and all...
You're video is rong
Or the Minecraft Universe is a curved plane with the Nether as a lower dimension with the same curve.
The fact it‚Äôs lower dimension with the same curve dictates that it must be smaller.
Just like a balloon has shorter distances when not as blown up.

If the radius of the Nether‚Äôs curve is smaller than the Overworld‚Äôs you could imagine the portal as a, well,  going *down*, which makes ‚Äúnether‚Äù a very accurate description of the Nether.

Edit:
This could also explain why compasses don‚Äôt work in the Nether.
Electromagnetism either isn‚Äôt a physical law in that lower dimension or works differently enough to cause it to spin.
Yaboi is in here making an awful lot of assumptions
I just have a question.. if the world is a block.. the son is a block.. etc... who's to say the forces are the same.. I mean .... is it even in a spiral universe?? Or is it a square one? Just wondering if the math would be the same in trying to figure out tidal forces, magnetic fields, time dilation, and so on.. jw if it would be spherical or square
Were talking about an infinite flat world, I don't think the laws of physics apply
nice hyphotesis. the thing is the minecraft's earth cant be orbiting that close to the sun. due to the fact in minecraft you can build stuff at nearly 255 blocks (more or less). which is equivalent to 255 meters (1 block = 1 square meter) from the bottom of these hypothetical earth (yeah, i said bottom, not center, minecraft world is flat, not round like our). as i was saying, we can easily find in wikis that sea level in minecraft is 62 (at the maximum sea level high ever recorded). 255-62=193, this means that the highest limit to build is 193 meters above sea level. and thats not even close to the sun in the distance. meaning that your values from minute 9 and onwards are wrong. also, nether is not another planet, its in another dimension...
you cant apply the physical laws of our world on this one, gravity has no meaning here. the physics of water have no sense, allowing you to create nearly infinite water by placing correctly some blocks (which btw are somehow still levitating). i propose to make new formulas, only applicable to this world.
Sir, you... Seem to have missed a memo. The Nether is meant to be below the Overworld, you know, the same planet? Under the bedrock layer. It is heavily implied, anyways. 
The End is meant to be a pocket dimension, BTW. Good video though.
Couldn't the nether be near the center of the planet? That way, advancing 8 meters down there could move you waay further once you move back to the surface (asuming a round planet and the fact that you're moving straight down/up each time)
Hey MattPatt,
You still have't apologized for that TF2 vs. Overwatch video you did.
Don't start thinking that two years is enough for everyone to forget your mistakes.
You even have the audacity to delete reasonable complaint comments on that video, let alone keep the video posted online.
That video shows a severe lack of research and respect, especially with respect to TF2. You spent more time editing than you did actually getting good info.
Now let us review what choices you have:
You can either delete that video and post a sincere apology, or you can leave that video alone as an eternal reminder of how low-quality and uninformed your videos actually are.
Came back to game theory game to find its just as toxic as when i left it
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
YOU'RE ALL WRONG!
So listen: in another video you already proved that the Minecraft Earth is round. Nice. The end is in another universe, beacuse when you jump into the portal, there isn't another portal where you landed. That's DONE. No need to worry about that.
The Earth is round. One block in the nether equals eight blocks in the overworld. If we take the nether to be round too, then what we get is that there's a planet, orbiting around a sun, on it's surface is the overworld. And INSIDE IT is the nether. We can prove this: inside a circle, a smaller circle's size is smaller. And everything lines up. Look:
The nether's size is eight times smaller than the overworld. So the nether is inside/below the overworld. When you dig down, there's the bedrock. If you fall through that, there's dark, and you can't see anything, and you'll die (even in creative). But if you inspect, under the overworld, and on top of the nether (yes, you can go there, if you didn't knew it) IT'S THE SAME DARK. THERE'S A BIG NOTHING BETWEEN THEM. This is why it's possible, that when you go trough a portal, and go 100 blocks away, you'll be 800 blocks away in the overworld. Everything's middepoint is the middle of that planet. When you build a portal, the game draws a line from the portal to the middle of the planet (what is under the nether actually) and where it meets the nether, it makes a portal. And you go away, build another, and the game draws a line again. But it's further, so it scales. I hope you understand me.
If you dig down in real life, it'll get hotter, and this is the case with the Minecraft planet too. Everyone knows that the nether is hot.
It's even called OVERworld! It's over the nether!
I have talked about this with a lot of my friends, and we argued a lot, but we think this is the reality.
You just overthinked it a little, I think.
But I still don't know, how can the overworld float above the nether. Maybe there's (I don't know why) so much energy there, between the bedrocks, that it levitates the overworld. And that power squishez you even in creative.
And you didn't talk about that when you're in the overworld, in the nether time doesn't go, and the same around.
Maybe you could make a theory about this too.
Good day everyone!‚ô•Ô∏è
What about the outside or outer area of the nether
Nether literally means under. Theory debunked
Take a drink every time he says Minecraft
is he playing bedrock
The way you say "liquid hot magma" at 0:30 makes me question my sexuality
I didn't know that Minecraft follows the laws of physic. Now explain how the breeding and growing up works and how the blocs can fly
(Notch has left the chat)
Or you know... it's just an alternate dimension, and you're also travelling between fabric layers of reality, not just space, so therotically this isn't causing the whole time stretch thing
Maybe it's because you keep saying "8 seconds slower/faster" rather than "8 times as fast/One-eighth the speed", but this all sounds like bad math.
Did you know that nether and the end are actually different dimensions not worlds or planets ?
Everyone feels smart after a austin video
OR!!!!!: you just get big wen u go 2 the nether
So you said whatever way we were thinking was wrong, but my first thought was "Is it that 1:8 ratio of blocks traveled?"
That's not how the square root of an equation works
Well, that was terrifying.

Now, where is part 2 of the Richest Video Game Characters???????
I think that the nether is basically just the core of the earth and that you only travel that far because the core of the earth is much smaller than the outside of the earth allowing you to travel farther quicker
I'm pretty sure Minecraft intended the nether to be hell considering when you bring up what biome it is it says "hell" this definitely brings science into the Minecraft world I like it but I'm pretty sure to them it was just "its magic" and the nether is under bedrock XD and I know a lot of people are going to be like then why when you break bedrock in creative mode in the overworld that goes down to nothing and when you break it up upward in the nether that also goes to nothing my answer for that says they were most likely just lazy to add that kind of accuracy to the game game development is hard  in the Minecraft world was intended to be just like earth with the same type of solar system but I guess if you get rid of the It's magic answer this is pretty much accurate as for the end yeah just magic xD
Nah m8 I've been there longer than 4 days and I never saw the world burn.
So... Like... Nightcrawlers Bampf thing?
I didn't sign up for this
Or... the nether is just underneath the overworld - a sphere, so the distance for the same angle will be shorter.
The nether is a other demention not another planet
Eat that or sue a hole I ducking drunk bitchs hahaha
OOOOOOORRRR it could be a different planet that is 8 times as small OOOOOOORRRR it is just underground, which means there is less surface area due to it being closer to the core
Guys think about it, when you break bedrock in the overworld what do you see below? Abyss. What happens when you break the bedrock above the nether? You see abyss.

That means there is a gap between the nether and the overworld, a big one. What's in this gap? The end. The end is between both the nether and the overworld. Think of it as the upside down like in stranger things.



Edit: regarding the nether, it's literally an underworld, so why does distance dramatically differ from the overworld? It because the closer you are to the center of the earth, the less surface area you can travel, making travelling the nether cover more distance than traveling the overworld based on relative surface area. Problem solved?
You know this is Minecraft right... there was no need for this ingesting yes but WHY
I like how this entire video is made invalid with 1 word - Multiplayer
Destroyed with also with this one simple notion - You are not starveling 800 blocks in the voer world, you are creating a portal, you have not travelled at all in the over world but in the nether, a separate place all together.
well, what if the nether is like closer to the core of the planet?
The Nether is another dimension and not a planet...
In that dimension the rules of physics might not apply, which would explain everything.
He committed William Afton in lava and fire.
3:50 Bold assumption...
12:44 bruh that‚Äôs now how you apply a square root.
But was this necessary?
WAIT WAIT WAIT.. did you say the earth lighting on fire as it enters the singularity? What if the nether is some kind of ‚Äúalternate earth‚Äù that had already been consumed by the black hole?
in short, Austin taught me one thing: magic=end of the world
Or the Minecraft world could be round and the nether could be its core... I mean, it's right there infront of you: "The Overworld"
couldnt you use XYZ coordonates to find the radius of the world?
I can‚Äôt believe I watched this whole video
Austin, take a break please, you are ignoring crucial information in this video... like seriously. We all know that the nether is not a different planet, and that the sun orbits the overworld and not viceversa

"Not convincing enough"
10/10
-IGN
Monster Energy energizes the Nether Portal
I only today noticed the amount of dandruff on Austin's hair and it is seriously distracting me...
You say the only way to make 8 meters in one place equal 1 meter somewhere else is to stretch space time but... that just isn't true.
See, the nether portal takes you to what is essentially hell, Hell is said to be underground, well on a planet which... at least matpat says is sphereical, the farther you go inwards, the less far you'd need to got to get from one place to another, right?
So,  traveling 1 meter underground could translate to 8 meters above ground.
Am I the only one that immediately thought ‚ÄúWell the Nether is literally Hell.‚Äù Every single time he mentioned a lot of energy would be required for something?
At 12:44, that's just not how square roots work, like, at all
Wait.... with time dilation being experienced by the player also, wouldn't it seem like a lot more time passes before the destruction of the overworld? Like maybe almost infinite time?
My understanding of physics gets distorted (like space-time) around (and especially in) a black hole.
It's a game where you can break wood bare handed. Stop it.
but Adam.... what if the nether is underground. spherical shrinking. take a circle and make a smaller circle inside it and draw two lines the top circle has a longer distance from point A to point B while its short on the inner circle.
Whats that song at 14:17 omg
Well for me it's better than fortnite now...

then again isn't everything
You forgot to take into account multiplayer. If 2 players are playing minecraft on the same server and one of them is in the nether the other is in the overworld the TIME is still the same for both of them THE DISTANCE you can travel in both worlds is what different NOT TIME.
why is "Aquarium" from "The Carnival of the Animals" by Charles-camille Saint-Saens playing in the nether?
Quote from Disney's bolt...."whoa whoa whoa waay too many words I was like what? Then I was like huh? Then..I got a little bored somethin 'bout radius?"
This is just a video for money tbh
It's just further down in the core of Minecraft's Earth so you'll cover more distance.

edit: OMG 180 LIKES. I realize its not perfect logic but I hope you get what I mean. These replies have been helpful.

Edit 2: 200 likes?! What's wrong with you all?! My max was like 30! I'm actually losing it!
What you seem to be ignoring, Austin, is that the Nether is supposed to be "somewhere else". As in, a completely separate plane of existence entirely. A place "beyond", or "beside" the regular Overworld, in another dimension.
     This means that the Overworld and the Nether don't necessarily need to obey the same set of natural laws. They don't exist on the same level of reality. They can each have their own separate set of physics to adhere to. The unknown manner in which the two levels of reality affect each other could account for the way travel between the two function.
I had let me explain she saw you
This is brilliant but I still don't get it...
Ok so what if it isn't moving in between worlds but it functions like the portal to the end where it takes you cross dimensions instead of space. PLEASE DO A THEORY ON THIS
but AUSTIN, what if the Nether is Within the Mincraft World and it's Teleporting you Directly Down instead?
Wait, I thought the nether was under the overworled, I never heard anyone say it i just assumed because of the bedrock ceiling
This sounds so crazy it almost sounds like something a psychopathic loser relying on zoloft and zero sugar monster would say
This assuming that the Nether is another planet, and not another dimension like the End.
I always assumed that the Nether was another dimension rather than another planet. I don't think we need any of this relativity mumbo-jumbo if that's the case, right? Surely a different universe than ours could have different sized space-time than ours? Idk I'm not a scientist.
The SCIENCE of Magic?
......Ah, we're just going to explain how the Nether is Hell...skip over that Hell is the actual biome name in the game....and spend ten minutes under the blatant misconception that the Nether is a....planet?
Neat.
You forgot one other area, The End. Which I say is a large pelt of islands made from a ripped apart planet that Is inside the black hole, if you look at the end‚Äôs life forms, their bodies are built to survive the strength of gravity that should be ripping them to shreds.
What about! Since bedrock encases the Nether, and is on the bottom of every Overworld....you're acturally in the center of the server you're on? Or some set up like that.
Could you do an episode on taitanfall 2, specifically scorch‚Äôs thermal shield, a device able to create enough heat to melt bullet rockets and even railgun projectiles out of the air? How much heat would that require and would it burn down everything around it?
Brother, I love this channel but I hate pointing out an error:
12:46, the math is wrong, E^2=(mc^2)^2+Pc^2 does not simplify to E=mc^2+p^(1/2)c
you could only perform that simplification if the + sign was actually multiplying. Maybe it is just a typo, I haven't checked if your math actually checks out, but that simplification is straight out wrong.
It would of saved you many hours of research if you just thought about how it makes more sense if the nether is under the bedrock. The nether has a bedrock ceiling so it would make sense and solve the 8 to 1 block ratio!
What if one is inside the other?
But Austin, the 8 times distance multiplier is only applied in 2 of the 3 spatial dimensions. The vertical axis of the nether / overworld directly correspond on a 1 to 1 ratio (y=80 -> y=80 for example).
its the endgame guys
How dose it form?
How much did it cost? All my diamonds. Minecraft:Endgame
damn i wish i was that smart
Wait is there a different person now
Hello Mr. Patrick, Mrs. Patrick and the rest of the Game Theory crew,

After hearing the announcement of Borderlands 3 being released sometime this year, my brother (linguaphiliax) and I (Jac.A.Cameron) had come up with a hypothesis.

We predict that Borderlands 3 will reveal the secrets behind the telekinetic alien of the pre-sequal (with a hint of Australian pride). We believe that they are part of species created from the vault. In addition, sirens are people who are vessals of vault energy that could've mutated their parents (similar to radiation causing people's offspring developing deformities). Or... Or, the Sirens are a sub-species/hybrid of the vault aliens, like a mule or tiger-lion. (Unlikely, as I don't think Jack would be open to that idea)

Evidence;

- The protectors of the vault in the pre-sequal have an almost identical design to the alien except of their mask which is probably used to categorised which vault they're assigned to.

- Both the protectors and sirens are both affected by eridium with an increase in power.

- If the Sirens' powers are created from radiation, then that energy has to be generated from somewhere. We think the Eridium is radioactive with it's purple glow. 
                  -----In addition to the other evidence, Angel was a powerful enough to control all of Hyperion technology. If Handsome Jack had a large sum Eridium, Angel would have developed the abilities from the radiation.

We hope you have the best of luck unpacking this theory. We had a lot of fun discussing this idea.

May many more theories come
- Jac. A. Cameron


(PS. That's my signoff, fyi)
My idea for the 1 block equaling 8 is that the nether is closer to the center of the Minecraft earth therefore making the sercomfrence of the nether smaller because it is a smaller sphere ish shape.
So, major issue with this:
While distance in the Nether is reduced, time is not effected.  You jump in the Nether portal, and your friend doesn't, time will pass the same for both of you.  This just means that the Nether is a smaller world than the Minecraft one.  Typical belief is that the Nether is simply at the center of the Minecraft world, but of course that cannot be true, since it is easy to observe that gravity is the same.  The game calls it a different dimension, but it is equally likely that it is another world, and you are under.  Given the gravity issue, this other world is smaller to start, and you being under it would make distances even smaller.  That or it is a very dense world, but that seems unlikely.

Of course none of that matters except for the first part:  Time is constant between the two, which in turn breaks everything that you talked about and makes it so that the Minecraft world is not in fact in danger from black holes.
I came to the conclusion that due to the Minecraft world being infinite it would also have infinite gravitational force so I believe that it IS THE SINGULARITY. The Minecraft world IS the center of the black hole üï≥
Minecraft world is a lot bigger then earth
So many people have proved that the nether is BENEATH the over world.
Next theory about minecraft should be where exactly is the ender cuz I have no clue
If u know or Game Theory have already figured it out plz kindly send me a link
not to debunk ur whole vid but what if the nether is inside the overworld, think of it as a world inside a world (hence the ceiling of the nether) and if u were to put it in a 2d perspective for ease of explaining the circumference of the overworld is 8x more then that of the nether.
What if the nether is simply underneath the overworld and the distance is great enough that rotation allows 1 nether block to be 8 overworld blocks?
Somebody make a mod for this
Wait but is nether a planet
How about the nether portal just makes you 8X smaller or bigger when going through the nether portal
Love the new music
There's time dilation in the Nether? That wouldn't explain how you're able to play in with another person in the nether at the same time at the same speed
What if you get bigger when you go to the nether
why is everyone saying that the minecraft world and nether world are like a circle that if the minecraft worl is a STRAIGHT FOREVER GOING FLAT EARTH
i feel like such anerd for understanding some rhings in this vid
Everytime he says "8 seconds slower" instead of "8 times as slow" I die a little on the inside
Huh.  Now I know yet another reason to tell my friends that the Nether Sucks--- and that they should totally build a base there.  XD
was anyone else more just thinking about the "liquid hot mmmmagmaaaa" reference because i abolutely just adored that little addition more than anything else in this video personally
Notch i dont feel so good
Dude its circles
I like how you made the earth round un reference to MatPat's theory
He went a little far üòê
MMMMMMAAAAAGGGGGGMMMMMAAAAA right Austin
0:33 when he says magma he sounds like Pewdiepie
I'm... pretty sure the nether is just a pocket dimension, not another planet.
Wow, Austin. I'm really impressed. A lot of careful calculation, consideration of the theories of relativity, all that number-pressing and looking things up to calculate the number of hours a planet so close to a black hole has left before it's obliterated. Honestly! Great video! You deserve a medal, man! I love your work, this included!
‚Ä¶.one small problem.
I guess you can say this is THE END of minecraft
The only issue I have with this is that Austin is treating the Nether like a  planet/moon but it's implied that its an another dimension. Hence why you need a portal to get there.
I don't think the nether is another planet Austin. It could be the Overworld's core.
the real tragedy is they changed the minecraft textures to rpg ones.
Minecraft: exists
Austin:I'm about to end this planets entire career.
Wait why is u voice different
0:23 That's not hell. Hell is trying to play on a server at 7fps.
or nether inside of earth and circle middle takes less time to get around outside of circle takes longer to get around so you travel 1 blocks but when on the outside you travel 8 blocks so bang solved boom
Love you Austin
Who else is reading the comments and just hears Austin screaming: DAMN BLACK HOLE AGAIN!
Do you remember being with FootOfaFerret?
The intro‚Äôs music is carnival of animals: Aquarium
Well


I‚Äôm going to pass  my Science test now
The Nether is not a separate planet. It's a dimension inside the world. So your Theory is wrong.
Today's Minecraft fact : Nether actually means "Lower in position"
Are you going to make part 2 of how is video games richest
Shout out lol.........................................gay lol.
nice reference: 0:31
E=Minecraft squared
Physicist here: at 12:44, line 2 and 3 are wrong; it's p^2 c^2, not p*c^2. Further, Line 3 does not follow from line 2. You can't just take the square root of each term individually, both terms on the right are stuck under the square root operator, so the math from then on can't be correct.

Also, you claim that in the cases you examine, the system requires existing inside the radius of the black hole to match your factor of 8 in time dilation. Therefore, the implication is that you could not create an object about which one may rotate that would experience a 8-fold dilation. IF this were the case (without checking the math, I'm skeptical), it would imply there is a maximum amount of time dilation that can ever be experienced by a massive body. If so, this number would CERTAINLY need to be quoted, and would end further questioning. If not, then you conceded it is possible to construct an orbit satisfying the conditions.

Also also, as everyone else is pointing out, being on a smaller radius of the same sphere would solve the problem of projecting different distances. HOWEVER, minecraft world is flat (argument for another time), meaning this couldn't work. However however, I believe in a different video GameTheory made, they argue the minecraft world to be spheroidal by arguments of gravity's magnitude and direction. So, in conclusion; it's a game, and the discrepancies are irreconcilable.

Still, always love GameTheory videos, keep up the good work guys :)
what if the nether is in another star?
I miss shouting Austin :(
That actually sounds like a good hardcore gamemode. You have 4 days to make shelter in nether and then you can't go back to overworld.
Austin isn't the Neather a separate dimension
In Game Theory‚Äôs mind: when should I make a Minecraft Nether theory?

2010: nah
2019: Now we‚Äôre talkin
This video was great! I am a long time fan of The Science, Game Theory and Film Theory in general. I was thinking about this theory and how I always thought the nether was some sort of underworld in the world's core, due to the lava. Afterwards, I began to think, "I know terrarria's version of the nether was in the core of the world, (and I know the world is round due to MatPat's theory on how the minecraft world is round), so I was thinking, what would having giant towers of obsidian, demons, and even a giant wall of flesh's implications be on the world?" I hope you can take my idea into consideration and think of doing an episode on it. Again, thank you so much for all of your theories, it has inspired me to think more critically of everything I see. Thank you for your time.
Oh i figured that it was that the portals always on sucking whatever touches it to the other side and expelling it out XD
havent watched gametheory in forever who is this and what happened
"It just works"
Why do you assume that the space of the overworld is stretched? Wouldn't it make more since for the space of the nether be compressed?
All this math only works if you don't take into account magic.
Yes but what if the nether is actually just inside the overworld
just saying, you should start doing what Mat Pat did with the greenscreen and not be 2d austin
what if the nether is inside the overworld.. just deep inside it and the bedrock is seperating it and theres  gap cuz u aint supposed to be there
All Nether just broke loose
This is legit the Minecraft rapture
Iron man can it be real?
Then there‚Äôs also when you go to sleep in Minecraft the screen goes black
Eat a Snickers you get scary when your hungry
I wanted at theory about the smell power of the villager
When he started talking about the Black hole I got lost
What if the nether and the over world are the same world, the over world simply layered on top of the nether, which would explain everything (assuming the world was spherical and the cubes are simply representations for the sake of gameplay): like, how on a circular running track, the person on the outside has to run much further than the person on the inside, the nether portal simply moves you up/down vertically.
The music is great
Elucidate, a word i never thought i would hear outside of the aristocats.
Someone should make a mod of this where you have to escape to the nether with any and all resources you've gathered after 92 days.
AUSTIN! Look at what you did at 12:46 ! The square root of a sum of squares is NOT the sum of the square roots !
nether is eight times smaller
edit:
i noticed it has the same gravity wait you are closer to the center because you're underground
Someone tell this guy it's just a game
I think I have a good theory about this: the reason why 1 nether block  is equal to 8 overworld blocks is because the nether is bigger, and when you enter the portal, it makes Steve grow, and when he exits, the portal shrinks him back
What about the fact that the nether is underground (presumably underneath the overworld)? Couldn't the nether just be like a lower layer making it like for example, A big circle and a little circle? You don't have to move as far on the small circle since it must be 1/8th the size causing it to be moving faster and for changes in position.
Not to brag or anything but I understood about 3 words in this video
All I have to say it's just a game üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ what's next a why mobs burn in the sun?
This assumes the nether is another planet. As many theories suggest, the nether is most likely "hell", or a place in the mantle of the planet. You could take some creative liberty and say that the diameter of the core is 1/8 of the crust's diameter, explaining this in a much more logical way.
Sounds like a fun challenge. Set timed commands to turn off the sun. Then fire.
Now do an episode on the hyperbolic time chamber from dragon ball.
What if that black hole is the end
Maybe the overworld is at Earth's orbital distance.
minecraft world is above the void, maybe this is the block hole
As a thought, since the nether is a 'hellscape', with a roof of bedrock, the inverse of the overworld, the implication to me has always been that the nether lies beneath the overworld, like for example how Terraria did theirs. In that, if we were to assume that the world which contains both the nether and the overworld was a planet, like you have here, with the nether beneath the overworld, surely there would be a differential in radii possible where travelling x distance across the circumference of the nether, that if the segment traversed were to be drawn out to the surface of the overworld, the length of the segment of circumference would be 8x. In which case, there would be no compression of mass, just a difference in depth.
Or the nether is placed underneath the main land. Since Minecraft is sphere. Inner sphere must smaller than outer sphere.
When you travel in inner sphere. Then translate the location using angular axis. It's possible that the nether is just a sphere world with 1/8 size in the main land sphere.
Wait I haven't watched game theory in a while, who is this and where is matpat?
What if the nether is just larger than the overworld
5:25 - You forgot the line of the fraction :)
Dear, Austin
The nether is most likely the core and if you take 2 differently sized spheres and try and go around them you will get around the smaller one first going in the nether is basically just going closer to the center of gravity so thus if you could (without creative) break bedrock under bedrock (if it was properly coded)would be the nether
Sincerely,
Max
Maybe it‚Äôs just a different dimension and they just don‚Äôt have the same rules with space time
you over thought this one mate o-o
hey i take zoloft too
Austin, I'm sorry, but, even though the game clearly states it as a separate dimension, it's just underground. It's the mantle of the planet. While the Minecraft world is flat and does have edges, it can still be assumed that it's a sphere displayed as a cube to keep with graphical themes. It takes fewer logical leaps of assumption to believe the nether is another planet entirely, especially when it has a ceiling... Of bedrock.
Assuming it's a sphere displayed as a cube, it's completely logical for one to travel a distance further down that equates to a farther distance on the surface. 
However, gravity would affect you more in the Nether than on the surface, since it is closer to the gravitational center of mass for the planet, meaning time would, in fact, go faster for people on the surface. However, this gravitational time dilation would be negligible.
The ISS orbits at an average height of 390 km. After 6 months on the ISS, the astronauts present will be a whopping 0.005 seconds younger than us on the surface. The average surface Y coordinate in Minecraft is ~50, with each block being 1 m in height. This means that bedrock is ~150m from the surface. Bedrock is on the roof of the Nether. Now, I'm not gonna say that the Nether is one block below bedrock, but even assuming another 150 m doesn't get it close to 390 km to get 1 microsecond of time dilation per year.
But its closer to the core.... doesn‚Äôt that mean the slow curvature ( i know its stupid in Minecraft) is faster, therefore ya know and stuffs
What if the portal harnessed the pull of the black hole itself.
Interesting. But can you prove the existence of FAIRY GOD PARENTS!
this is hurting my brain
insert concerned Tom face
I like how he didn't even criticise the fact that setting an obsidian ring on fire could create a portal that could end the world
I always thought that the nether was like hell, under the OVERworld and the reason you travel faster is because the nether is smaller than the over world.



Kinda like a small circle in side of a big circle, you can travel that small circle way faster than the big circle

But hey you theory works so I guess I can change the way I view it.
Too much garbage talk.
It's inside of the overworld, not outside.
It's not a new planet, it's not a fricking Zebes.

It's a new dimention inside a bigger dimention.
It works like VirtualBox.
It's a goddamn cake in a box
that's not a lie
I'm Just going to point out that you can have a combination of speed and near mass to account for the problem. Also---- You didn't consider the curvature of space time when calculating your radiuses. Light itself can orbit a blackhole, having no mass, and traveling at literally the speed of light, at 1.5x the schwartzshield radius of the blackhole, matter at near light speed orbits just above 3x. 

As such, You can have the overworld traveling at your 99.22% C around  black hole (That is big enough to fit the 6000 kilometer wide minecraft world within an orbit between 1.5x and 3x it's swartzshield radius. 


Additional energy sources inlude that the overworld could be spinning, or be really heavy itself, or accelerating.

Additionally it should be considered that the mapping of the overworld to the nether via the nether portals might just be distorted. Why would it have a straight 1:1 mapping?
The nether is below the overworld...
Like hell...
It is not on a different planet
among the other things listed, you've also forgotten that the Overworld does not orbit its star. everything orbits the Overworld.
The black hole is the end in minecraft
He y If you cnalize the portal energy you could scape the blackhole
Couldn't the portal just shrink everything?
So in the nether every side of the blocks is just 1/8 of the ones in the overworld. That means the Portal just has to shrink everything coming through to the nether and has to enlarge everything to make it back to "normal".
Sure, compressing it takes a lot of force in theory, but theres other magic happening in Minecraft.
OK this is more of a film theory but if what u said at 5:12 to 5:17 is true then wouldn't Doctor Strange from the MCU be destroying everything in existence with the time stone
Fortnite: We make the most out of all of the games in the world

Minecraft: Hold my Water Bucket
Now if this only this fit together with Mat's theory that Minecraft's planet is the center of its solar system. Not to complain though, the rest of the comment section is doing more than enough of that already.
Minecraft is flat
4:33 ima send this screenshot to my friends with no context
Loud, obnoxious, and vulgar. I hate his videos.
Austin, the nether is the underworld of minecraft, it is deeper than the overworld as referenced by an achievement.
The thing is that the nether "sphere" is inside and smaller than the minecraft world's globe, that's why it's hot, its deep.
As a consequence of this, travelling a short distance in a small sphere translates to a longer distance when getting out of the nether by going straight up.

No need for relativity here.
Two circles and a square
Could the nether and the end be moons
Hey make a plants vs zombies episode
or another answer it's just 8 seconds in the future below the surface of the overworld hence why there is bedrock above the nether..
The nether is in The lower mantle. The portal goes radially on a geometric circle. 1/8 the radius of the crust sits the nether deep inside the planet. Directly accounts for the 8 times travel distance with a constant energy requirement.
My child hood destroyed
This dude just needs a blunt
I‚Äôm pretty sure the nether is another dimension
What about the end portal?  Does it not have a effect like the nether portal?
and thus, development of "Austin's Apocalypse" mod is practically destined (mod devs, we want this)
I always considered the size difference was because the nether was inside of the world (underground) making the overworld 8 times bigger then the nether.
Why do these videos always apply real world physics to game franchises that obviously follow different laws of physics, conpletely different laws, making theories like this kinda invalid
Or it could be magic
how about you explain this.


Minecraft is its own Plane. its own Dimension, and there are infinite Planes.


The Nether is also its own Plane, a variation of the Minecraft Plane.


not only are they their own planes, this also means that they both are infinite. this is true, since we have the Void, and there is no sky limit. relatively in every direction, the Minecraft Universes are Infinite.
"EVERYTHING YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS IS WRONG"


But what if I told you...
I was thinking the same thing you were thinking
NETHER WORLD = QUANTUM REALM
Let's look at it a different way: The nether is hell and below bedrock levels, as you're closer to the core the circumference of the circle you make when moving in a straight line is going to be smaller. To put this in earth terms, lets work in Earth units. The surface has a circumference of about 40k km. If we look at the circumference equation C = 2œÄr and shift it to solve for radius: r = C/2œÄ that gives us about ~6370 km of the surface. However, in the nether 1 block = 8 blocks (with blocks equalling one meter), that would mean we would need a circumference 1/8th that size, meaning a circle of around 5k km. Reapplying the same equation as before, r = C/2œÄ, that would place the player 796 km from the center, or rouglhly 5800 km down from the surface, placing it within the Earth's swelteringly hot inner core. Moving 1 block forward at this new depth would be equivalent to taking 8 steps upon teleporting straight up back to the surface, solving the general issue without throwing the entire planet into a massive black hole.

This equation set will apply for any sets of circumference to 1/8th circumference, although numbers will vary. As the minecraft world is infinite, so is the circumference technically, the nether's is just 1/8th of that infinite circumference. And again, as the world is infinite in size, and therefore must be infinitely massive, it becomes clear traditional gravity laws *do not apply*, as if they did, the player would be crushed by the gravity of infinite mass, and the player would not be able to simply fall into the endless void of the End as there is no mass to actually pull the player down. Therefore it's safe to assume that the gravity part is non-applicable (same thing for massive floating blocks, actually), therefore solving all problems without causing instadeath.
How is Austin so frikin smart
If minecraft is infinite then how does the sun make it around?
'It's not what you are thinking'
Well I've seen you before and you mentioned swarschild so....
Black holes?
Here are two other possible theories
a. The nether is 8 times smaller, moves at the same velocity and the portals link relative to the two dimensions (the north pole of the overworld and the north pole of the nether.
b. The nether lies underneath the overworld (bedrock ceiling in nether, bedrock floor in the overworld and so the nether would be rotating with the overworld and that the nether portals just "drop" you underneath the bedrock layer to the center of the earth.
Yay. No blackhole necessary, makes things a lot simpler, and still fits realistically.
Minecraft is the singularity
What if the Nether is located inside of the sun
the is bull
I‚Äôm ok with Minecraft being destroyed AFTER I finish my cake
So so sorry, but the Nether isn't another dimension, or even another planet. If you go into creative and mine up to the "ceiling" of the Nether, it is made of bedrock. You can break through in creative, and you are in the void if you go through it. My guess is that instead of the mantle in the Minecraft world, there is the void, and the void kills you because it is so insanely hot (although when you break through bedrock in creative, you would have to account for the pressure difference.)  Anyway, my point is that the void is in between the Nether and the Overworld. The only reason one block in the Nether is equivalent to one block in the Overworld is that the closer you are to the origin to a sphere, the faster you can move around on it. For example, if you are on a circular racetrack, if you drove closer to the edge you could make it around the track slightly faster than the other cars if they were moving at a speed equal to yours.
Ok can someone explain how the end works then
Austin I'm sorry but.. the nether is the outer core I think
What if the nether is just smaller than the overworld by 8 times so the portals move 8 times more in the overworld. Occams razor, don't add overbearing science to something that can be solved with such a simple thought.
I'd be lying if I said I understood anything, but man was it fun.
... hmm i wonder if that be an interesting mod.. Like somehow make it so that you have lets say.. 2 in game weeks to prepare and evacuate the minecraft earth. gather food. resources stuff like that. Then with those items you head to the nether and the portal becomes unusable since the other side no longer exists. you have to see how long you survive in the nether. though you would have to make water work in the nether.
Is this college?
BUT EARTH IS FLAT
challenge where you have 96 hours and then you can't go back to the overworld
what happens if your playing mutltiplayer and ones in the nether and ones in the normal? does time get ripped apart? my mind...
Square root of a sum doesnt equals the sum of the square roots
Hmm.. what about The End?
MINECRAFT: END GAME
‚ÄúWe are in the End Game now!‚Äù -Steve
Nevermind
Ah, now you need to explain some of illegal items on Minecraft! XD
yo in metal gear solid 5 the phantom pain you can have the r&d team create a worm hole extraction device to transport things to base. you could have a good scream over that one.
So here I was typing up how you don't need to stretch time in order to explain the 8 meter/meter difference due to connecting two flat spacetimes arbitrarily with Einstein-Rosen bridges wherever you want them to be, and you mentioned wormholes or whatever.


But also you got your Energy equation wrong. E^2=(mc^2)+p^2 c^2. not pc^2. 


but yeah, connecting two flat spacetimes is much easier and safer than trying to use Schwarzschild geometry to achieve your time bending. Also, if you're going to use THAT then you'd have to equate proper distance between the two points, and you need to take into account the apparent compression of space in the radial direction towards the black hole/ spacetime source. You have to use the entire metric instead of just the time component.
OR, the mine earth is bigger than the nether, I am going to say 8 times (correct me, I don't have time to check) so the nether must be the earth's mantel/core so the nether portal just has to teleport you down, and since the nether is (maybe) 8 times smaller it would take 8 times less time to travel around it, BEAT THAT AUSTEN!
The Nether is Hell, it is not the future.
Not to burst your thought bubble, but isn't this just a difference in circumference for the smaller inner circle of the planet and the surface? It is hell, the portal teleports you straight down. If you travel 100 blocks on a smaller circle and get ported back up to the surface, you covered more circumference up there than below, but the same % of the overall circumference of either circle.

Space bending.... 0.

If this model is used, one could even calculate how far down hell is.
The problem is that there is no time dilation between the nether and the overworld, just spacial contraction. Assuming, for example, that your home base in the overworld is on a spawn chunk, you can leave a process running, do something in the nether, and come back to the process completing at its normally expected time. Or, if your base isn't in a spawn chunk, the process will unload and only resume when you get back whether you're returning from a trip to the nether or have wandered sufficiently far away.

It's reasons like this that I've rejected SR and GR as explanations for the spacial differences between the nether and the overworld. The theories don't fit what's going on.

My leanings are towards the nether and the overworld being Matrioska worlds. Which could also explain why they have similar gravitational acceleration.
If the minecraft world is moving at almost lightspeed how are stars visible at night???
Cool but that‚Äôs totally not how the nether works, the nether is basically closer to the core and as such less distance to travel down there to reach a point on the surface
The Nether is the core of the overworld.
But isn't their a game theory of the minecraft world being a hollow sphere with a very small blackhole in the middle?
The nether isn‚Äôt even in the same dimension as the overworld
This videos is crap
Its that 1=8 lol
Out of nowhere question, did you ever comment on a comment's comment
Another video with a guy yelling at the mic
Austin: To calculate the spacetime curvature of the Nether.

Hay were is matpat
Song at the start?  Name?
The Nether is the core of the (spherical) Overworld, measuring 1/8th the radius. 

It's better illustrated though.

Nice video anyways
From what I see in the comment section my portrayal of this audience is WRONG ,im not putting all my eggs in the same basket, from i thought(humble intellectuals or hell just some memers) but instead i get some egotistical testicals which cant understand some humor (contradicting themeselves) 
Tldr most comment section is r/wooosh and r/iaverysmart
Yo what happened to matpat i aint been here for a long time
It's breaking because of fortnite
>implying the nether is another planet as opposed to another dimension that's occupying the same space at another vibration or something. It always comes down to black holes with Austin...
Can we just acknowledge that this dude is using bedrock edition?


seriously bro
i think we're missing the simplest of answers here... For every block in the nether you move, you move 8 in the overworld. Has anyone considered that the nether (a fake version of hell) is located in the same location as theoretical hell? underground? if we consider the shape of the minecraft world to be an actual sphere instead of a block, where the circumference of the overworld is just 8 times as large as the nether, we can locate how deep the nether actually is. the nether portal just goes directly up, which will be 8 times as far since the world is round. this theory makes more sense because if you play multiplayer and the other person goes into the nether, they dont immediately fly into the future. i'm not sure if anyone thought if this, but this is the simplest solution and makes the most sense. not everything needs to be super complicated
It‚Äôs already been proven that the minecraft world is a sphere. If the nether is the core, then that‚Äôs how that works. If you move the same speed in the nether, you have to move 8 times as fast in the overworld
Wait wtf
What type of spiders ARE the minecraft cave and regular spiders? Wonder if there will be a video about this
Literally going over this in my physics 3 class ü§£üòÇüòÖüò∞üò≠

EDIT At least the relativity parts
i feel like i just looked into the window of a mental asylum...
what if the the nether is inside of the regular minecraft world and walking one meter under then then travelling straight up, since the planet is a sphere, maybe, it'd just be like that
Your not matpat
when are u gunna bring back who makes the most money
Maybe the nether is the center of the Minecraft, underneath the bedrock. If 8 blocks on the surface = 1 block in the nether then the nether is 7/8 the way down to the center of the planet. So the nether portal just moves you strait up and down.




If Minecraft is 8 times the size of Earth, the nether is Earth.
What if the nether was deep underground? Assuming Minecraft is a globe and you went straight up time dialation wouldn't have to exist. The void could just be an oxegenless layer between the overworld and the nether.
Austin, I have a theory to make.... HEROBRINE IS SUCH A POWERFUL FORCE THAT HES MAKING THE OVERWORLD STAY TOGETHER!
Just got to this video and I gotta say that you've gone way off the beaten Minecraft path. You see, you're wanting to use science and all of our known working physics.
One thing that you're forgetting is that the Nether doesn't have a sky at all. Nope, no sky. You will hit bedrock well before you ever reach a sky. Trust me, I've done it, other Minecraft players have done it, and I'm sure you either have or will eventually do it.
What the Nether actually is, just like The End, is another plane of existence. Yes, another dimension. It is to also be noted that not all of our physics works in Minecraft. You can pick up literal tons of materials and still walk and run about with no slowing down. You can compress individual diamonds into one meter on each side blocks on a crafting table! The heat from such compression would be incredible!

Seriously, you gotta stop thinking with actual physics and get with what is really happening in Minecraft. It's all another universe of existence. Sure, there are multiple copies of each, but people can travel from one to another with proper access. 
It's really more along the lines of planar travel that you can find in Pathfinder or D&D (I mean actual D&D and not the total crapfest that sprung up after 3.5 and totally ruined one of my favorite settings for me and others by turning everything upon its head, murdering it, shoving a bunch of idiocy into its mouth and other orifices, raising it back as some unholy monstrosity, and removing anything that was good and canon. Ed Greenwood would know what I'm talking about. Just ask him)
So, yeah. You're not dealing with physics from our universe. Remember that.
why are people still talking about minecraft 10 years after the release
This guy is crazy
What about Matt's theory that the sun revolved around the sun
It's a dimension.
Pether Nortal
The nether is in an extra planar location. It's extra-dimensional. It is most definitely not a different planet orbiting in the same star system as the Minecraft overworld. It's like the Planes of DnD. Austin, I'm ashamed of you now. You should have known this.
The nether is BENEATH the mincraft world, not next to it, this also explains why 1 block=8 (because the nether has less mass)
ITS A GAME
The Nether is not a another planet, it another dimension. The Nether does not exist in the same space-time as the overworld. This whole theory is base in a false postulate.
Sleep? Kaboom! Compas? compass has seizure Clock, you work right? clock has a worse seisure
My brain hurts
What if both of the nether and overworld are on the same planet?
Einstein doesn't say that Light is a wave. It was Christiaan Huygens Job. Pls notice this failure
Wtf its just a minecraft - game where you can punch a wood
Minecraft is great

The answer is so simple, you will be disappointed.... 

In the Minecraft world you start on is the surface world which ends at bedrock at the lowest point and the "Nether" is the underworld which has bedrock at the highest point and the only way to penetrate this barrier is though a portal that links the two worlds. 

So given what we know about the Earth is that it's spherical, as are all other planets we've encountered, so we can assume the world of Minecraft is similarly spherical and if we apply that knowledge to the fact that we know the nether is BELOW the surface all we need to do to account for the 8x movement increase is to calculate just how far below the surface the Nether actually is because the further down one goes the smaller the circumference of the sphere which means seemingly increased travel speed when in reality you are traveling the same distance at the same speed and it's the difference in elevation coupled with the teleportation between the different elevations that accounts for the extra distance traveled and decreased travel time on the surface when using a route through the Nether. 

We can answer this one with simple physics and geometry, we need not bother with special relativity unless examining how the Nether portals operate which I expect involves some form of quantum entanglement given that when a portal is opened on one side another portal suddenly springs into existence on the other side meaning the frame itself exists at two points simultaneously acting as a wormhole for any who pass though it.
sayenc lolt of sayentc
Austin, you are a very smart man but i feel like you are overlooking several simpler explanations, for example my first thought relating  to the distance differences is what if the nether is beneath minecraft. minecraft is a truly massive world but there is no evidence that it isnt spherical. if it is, then by going straight down far enough, taking a few steps and digging straight up, you could theoretically end up in a different continent entirely. no space-time compression required(aside from what you get from being closer to the planets center of gravity). alternatively if you assume they are different planets,  there is always the possibility of environmental factors effecting the portals. maybe the nether is 8 times smaller and the portals judge based on relative angle from the center of gravity. the portals could even just be designed differently on either side for ease of travel. and the player just doesnt know how to adjust it(maybe when the were originally invented they were intended for transportation like a subway or airport )if you have the technology to make a teleporter, it isnt too much of a stretch to imagine you could program it to send you to a specific location. these were just the ideas i was able to think of before your video ended, i am sure there are plenty more you could come up with if you took the time. i love your videos Austin and i am not saying you should stop discovering hidden apocalyptic scenarios, but before you rant about how impossible a situation is, maybe you should stop to consider the possibility of more mundane solutions
I now have proof to my parents how Minecraft can make us smart and creative.
My head hurts
U might have missed something what if the never is in a different universe its still earth but this earth escaped there black hole it did all the distorting thing u said and lit on fire wich is how the never looks and bc the black hole would need to releas a huge amount of radiation to sudenly collapse it mutated the survivers leaving the never mobs we have today
NETHER IS NOT ANOTHER PlANET

It's just another dimension
You can call the end in space but not nether



And dude it's a video game don't compare it to real life
Thanos didn't even need the infinity gauntlet.
lmfao, how many kids are like 
"whats a stargate?"
I like this guy
Lets just say the nether is another planet and we built a teleporter and call it a day
Is he gone mad ?  üòÇüòÖ
Why are you operating on the assumption that the nether is in the same universe as the overworld?
1:40
so you're not going to bring up the 1 block in nether=8 blocks in overworld spacetime flux?
3:02
you promised...
I love Austin
Or......
the nether is on the same planet, just underneath the void beneath the overworld (hence why there is bedrock above and below the Nether.
The Nether is smaller because it has to be to fit inside the planet, and that is why 8 blocks = 1 block of the overworld.
People have pointed this out already, but this theory is just wrong. Other people have provided alternate explanations, but they don't disprove his theory. However, I believe this will. Entering the Nether does not change change your time, and thus you are ONLY BENDING SPACE, not time. This means that it is for this theory cannot be correct under our laws of physics, likely meaning the Nether, the overworld, or both are not in our universe.
can there be a disc 11 and disc 13 theory?
12:48 That is totally incorrect. E¬≤ = (mc¬≤)¬≤ + PC¬≤ is equivalent to E = ‚àö((mc¬≤)¬≤ + PC¬≤). You can't apply the square root to all variables in the addition individually.
Listen. Youre taking this from the wrong direction. The nether is supposed to be below the bedrock.(lorewise. You know. Its hell..)  Which means if the minecraft world is considered a globe, you can travel faster undergound because
You are so far underground that pretty much the surface area of the nether is smaller compared to the surface area of the overwolrd. Which makes a lot of sense really. 

Its also hotter down there since it is so far down. 
Earth is the best thing to look at there.

There really is no need to go into black hole theories.

I mean theyre cool but they dont apply here exept for the tiny possibility of the portal being a legit wormhole which is absolutely impossible by the way.

Furthermore,
Time in the nether doesnt work correctly since you are so deep underground you pretty much have no idea what time it is. The only place that could really be considered another dimension is the end.

So in short. To rephrase it

Imagine a crossection of a ball. Then inside that, imagine a smaller ball. Which are pretty much 2 circles at that point. The smaller one represents the floor of the nether and the bigger one the floor of the overworld. If you were to go straight down, onto the surface of the nether, and for example take a measuring tape that reaches for about 100 meters. It will travel a larger amount of degrees of the circle than it would on the surface. Simply because, seen from the side the floor of the nether has a much smaller surface area than the much bigger circle that is the overworld.

And dont come and tell me the world of minecraft is supposed to be flat.
Its not.
It is a globe. This proves it.
The best way to depict a globe in a  world of cubes is to not do it.
Since its impossible.
Notch really just made a game with blocks. Not a simulation


Im sorry. This is just too farfetched for me to not say anything. I know that its normal for these theories to be very... farfetched lol but i like em like that.


Nice try. I liked it.

But your are

Without a doubt

Wrong.
what if instead of a wormhole linking two locations in our dimension, the nether portal is actually just a method of rotating you into higher dimensions outside of the 3 dimensions we're used to. Basically, the six axes that we're used to in our world have their own isolated set of physical interactions. In miegakure, whenever you rotate in higher dimensions, the world seems to stretch and distort around you, making distances longer or shorter according to your rotation. Fez has a similar concept, but brought down to a 2 dimensional plane, where rotating your 2D character in 3D space seems to mess with distances, allowing you to bridge gaps of limitless distance with a simple rotation. If we take that concept and apply it to the third dimension, it might be possible for an entire other world to exist hidden in plain sight, at an angle imperceptible to us. I'm sure this still doesn't help the case for the energy problem, seeing as how you'd literally be rotating out of our perceptible universe, but minecraft isn't just a game with other worlds, it's also a game featuring beings from higher dimensions, eldritch figures who exist outside the minecraft universe. If we consider the ender portal as a signal rather than a doorway, then we could get assistance from higher dimensional beings who would see our world of six axes as a diorama almost, where they'd be capable of making relatively simple adjustments from their perspective. Think of it like the nether and the overworld being two 3 dimensional universes that are overlapping in 4D space or higher. Then the scariest thing you'd have to deal with is the knowledge that there are eyes larger than life that can see every action we act out with no walls that could hide us from their sight!

Okay so Austin I have watched your videos always and I just realized something... you have done all these videos about sonic and there are a bunch of them!!! But what about shadow!!!! Like who‚Äôs faster sonic or shadow who‚Äôs stronger in actual power is there a way to figure this out with science!!!!
Mat Pat ( or Austin) PLEASE READ THESE COMMENTS. THESE PEOPLE HAVE A POINT!!!!!!!!!!
Minecraft never dies for me
Did Matpat quit or something? I don't think his voice is the same.
What?
Minecraft was my childhood
Dude Alberts red mustache looks like a flaming hot Cheeto
Did you consider the idea that maybe the overworld is encapsulating a huge Dyson's Sphere? And inside the Dyson's Sphere is the nether? The Bedrock is the Dyson's Sphere. And that is why Bedrock is also the nether ceiling.
So it's a tardis expect its big on the outside instead of the inside
I mean sure you'd survive in the Nether.... until you went to bed.
He probably just watched a Minecraft Parody and decided this would be a good Theory.
am i glad that the nether isn't a planet in the same solar system but a parallel dimension like the end
what if that all energy come nether if that door are all redy in there there just need something (likemagnet) what can keep taket that massive energy and use it a portal neather are aftel all most lava and soul dust ? yms but no obsidian so if nether found normal obsidian that mean neather can invade minecraft word like that to `? and more funny thing above a enenergy its use and time
Isn't the Nether another dimension and not another planet?
So, I don't mean to dismiss all of your research and data, but draw a circle inside of a bigger circle. then draw two lines in a "+". the distance between the end of each line is further towards the outer circle, That's how the nether works. it's INSIDE the planet. Hence why when you dig straight down and find bedrock, and going to the ceiling in the Nether you are blocked by that same bedrock... Just saying.
This was good.
But it's another Dimension not an other World/Planet
And also it's UNDER the Normal World that's why there's Bedrock at the top of it
Remember Minecraft doesn‚Äôt have the same gravity as our universe. Remember: most materials are not affected by gravity. You can also see the mass of the nether and the over world by how long it takes gavel or sand to fall.
so crazy thought: minecraft is not a planet or round and i does not obeys the same laws. Hence why there is a edge to every map
Where is part two of the richest video game characters
The thing is nether portal is not a elevator and its not a portal to another planet either, it is a dimensional rift that takes you to a separate dimension, not to a separate planet or to a hellscape

The neather planet should be black/gray all over cuz the bedrock on top
How about this. Black holes have not been added in the game yet. Problem solved
I just wanna play my game
Le epic
The music in this videos make me D:
Doesn't it make more sense that the Nether is within the 'Earth' (as the underworld) with 1/8th the radius of the overworld? That way, moving 1 block in the Nether would move you 8 blocks in the overworld relatively, and it still makes sense when playing multiplayer (people experience the same progression of time in the overworld and Nether).
the way Austin said "Liquid hot mahgmha" was amazing
Austin, I have a "the SCIENCE" idea for you, Little Mac's transformation into giga mac is legitimately horrific, he like doubles in size in the course of 2 seconds, and looks like he gains over 100 pounds of muscle, and like the pokemon evolution video, I imagine this would be a super violent reaction that would not only kill him but probably everyone around him for a significant area, and I think what makes it even scarier is even if they survived there would be a violently explosive reaction when he suddenly "lost" half of the matter making up his body, not only that but this reaction happens FAR FASTER than the Pokemon transformation, I don't know if that interests you, but the Pokemon evolution video is a personal favorite for me and I would love to see  Little mac to Giga mac explained the same way
Since when was the Nether a separate planet? Isn't it supposed to be a separate dimension? Wouldn't that also mean that laws in the Nether wouldn't exactly fit the laws of the Overworld?
So in a nutshell....its physically impossible for the nether to be a different planet unless there's a black hole about to destroy the minecraft overworld...THEREFORE ITS PROBABLY A DIFFERENT DIMENSION NOT ANOTHER PLANET!!

Hands up if you already knew that‚úã‚úã‚úã
Hold up. At 12:47, you didn't do the math right.

You pretty much did a¬≤ +b¬≤ = c¬≤ -> a + b = c, which is blatantly false and doesn't make sense. You can't use square root over addition like that.
Or... if Minecraft was a planet, the Nether is really close to the core, so it takes less time to travel across the same angular distance.
Now, can you explain the exploding beds???
You say that the over world altering its distance from the nether would cause exponential changes in energy. Wouldn't orbit also cause this since distance in this manner would still fluctuate? Would it make more sense that the "sun" in this sense is the nether since this distance could remain negligible?
So based on this theory, what would happen if the Minecraft world was destroyed while you were in the Nether? Would the Nether Portals be destroyed? Would the singularity suck the Nether somehow through the portals, destroying both worlds? Essentially: if you link two spaces and one is destroyed by a black hole, what happens to the other?
Nether is supposed to be under the Minecraft Earth, I think. Anyway, my point is, if Nether is inside Minecraft Earth, the portal only has to be connecting the surface world and nether and not necessarily another planet. 

If nether is deep enough, the math would make sense.  ds = dr . dŒò (where ds is the displacement on the surface of a circle for an angular displacement dŒò relative to the center of the circle) is quite an elementary formula but it should work here. Assuming that the nether is in Minecraft earth (underground), which lets say is a circle for brevity.  if you say make an angular displacement of say 0 to dŒò in the nether, it would make a displacement of ds. If the nether is deep enough, it could make a displacement of 8ds on the surface world.

You can calculate the radius of minecraft earth with this. You do not need Einstein's theory of relativity for this. The portals only need to connect two points inside the same planet with no funny time buisness and only go directly above to the surface world or directly below. This is the principle (in the future) space hooks will use.
Is he desperate for ideas???
Some one should make a mod that has a timer that is a count down until the over world is destroyed
Is there anyway of getting out of Nether if a Ghast shoots the fireball at the Nether portal and shuts the portal off and ur flint breaks down? :D
But why is the Nether the hotter one when the real world is closer to the star?
Press F to pay respect to old villagers. 
üò¢
I feel like someone else said this but the isn‚Äôt the nether a dimension or universe different from the over world like the end dimension.
Also you are completely wrong. Moving 1 block in the nether moves you 8 in the surface because the nether is inside the planet.. and has a smaller circumference.
This is a good video. I know you were more interested about talking about science using further evidence in the game then your logic is flawed.

Time doesn't go slower or faster while you're in the nether but I'm sure you know this. It's more likely that the minecraft nether is withing and below the Minecraft world? Under the Bedrock, allowing you to travel less distance to get to the same place simply because you've been traveling over a smaller globe?
14:50 interesting point here.  By that point however it is the exact opposite for stars outside that orbit.  The sun‚Äôs ray pull away; but the distant starlight is pulled towards you.  That and the distance between the sun and planet are being compressed as well.  Light close enough to the event horizon actually lenses bag as the wavelength is redistributed.  Light still passes, but it it refracted in the accretion disc.  Like staring at a car tire can seem to spin backwards; light will introvert regularly.
See I told you Minecraft is popular again
If anyone says he gets anything wrong and complains about it, do you know how much research and work does it take to make each of these videos? Sure their sometimes mistakes but, he is human and this work is all tiresome and he is doing all these videos for us.
Yo guys, let's just steal the entry from Fortnite!
Smoke weed.
The Nether is a donut hole dimension rested in the mobius torus of the overworld. True story. Only the End is outside the well of overworld.
"The Nether, the final frontier- oh wait that's the end. FU- 
The Nether, the second frontier..." literary laughed my head off already XD
Pether nortal
3:28 freeze-frame here: some inhabitants of the minecraft world don't believe their world is flat, and use these images with POV distortion to justify their insane theories that their world is round! They are know in minecraft as round-earthers...
Many have shown them that no a matter how far you travel in one direction you'll never get back to the same place, but they still insist... there's just no reasoning with them! xD
I always thought the nether was just below bedrock in the overworld and the void above "nether roof" and under bedrock in the overworld was the thing the separated them. This also makes "kinda" sense in terms of the 1=8 blocks in the nether, since there it takes less to go 360 degrees if you are closer to the center and shorten the radius. It would also explain the multiplayer problem with this hypothesis. The portals simply make you go down to Earths core. This is, of course, considering that the Minecraft world is a sphere
What about the End?
I just figured that the portal teleported you further into the planet and it was the curvature of the minecraft world that caused the fast travel
Pether nortal
Austin, you messed up bad at 12:45.  You took the square root incorrectly.  You should get:


E =  c*sqrt((mc)^2+p)


Which is wildly different than what you got.
what about the fact you create matter everytime you create a portal, ?
I am so confused
Is the end portal safer :v






Im going to live with my homie the dragon
Soooo...    What about The End?
The nether isnt another planet
Why not Newtonian? What's to say it's e=mc¬≤ and not d=rt in the main world and d8=rt in the Nether?
It seems like a good theory, but I think the nether is another dimension. Not necessarily another planet in orbit around a sun, I think in the nether it isn't about time being compressed it is about space being compressed. If 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld, but time stays the same. I think what is happening is that the amount of space a person travels in the nether is more spread out vs in the overworld. So if you travel 64 blocks in the overworld someone in the nether only has to travel 8 blocks because space is the effect that has changed.
Volcanic glass + fire = wormhole

That's physics for you
Someone should make a get to the nether mod based on this theory
This awesome video combined all of the things I love about this world...video games (esp minecraft), cosmology, theorizing and physics! Bravo! Thanks for sharing. I really appreciate the content.
What if you think the nether is a sphere (which you walk on top of) under the Minecraft world. Since the nether sphere is smaller, you wouldn‚Äôt have to bend space time cus you would go faster on its surface that in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world
Why not make nether 8 times slower...
Austin. May I remind you the nether is a different DIMENTION. Their's no way they can be orbiting the same star. Also the only amount of energy required is the energy given off by a single flick of flint and steel. 






Then again, I luv yur vids boi =]
Do you take ideas for videos?
I..am afraid.
What if the only thing being pressurized is the stuff you bring back from the Nether? What if each Nether block is just 8 times the size of each Overworld block, and anything that goes to the Nether through that portal essentially has it's density decreased some so that it's volume gets multiplied by 8? And anything that goes to the Overworld through the portal has it's density increased so that it's volume is divided by 8.
Case closed, the only thing turning into a black hole is that blaze powder you needed for your eye of ender. Well, assuming blaze powder has a really high density from the start.


How about instead of trying to figure this out, you try to figure out WHY THE HELL BEDS TURN INTO CREEPERS' REJECTED COUSINS WHEN YOU GO IN THERE? (That means make a video discerning why beds explode in the Nether and the End)
Oh I thought this was gonna be an episode about the fact that if nether fires burn infinitely, if you left the portal open long enough, it would burn enough oxygen to either produce runaway greenhouse effect from the amount of CO2 produced, or cause asphyxiation from the lack of oxygen, and then calculate how long it takes but this is cool too
I don't get anything... 





I shouldn't have skipped science class
What if instead of the planet travelling at near speed, or being close to a black hole, the nether was just 1/8th the size of the overworld. Then just have 1 random block in a 8x8 grid locked in a quantum superposition with 1 block on the nether? That's probably close to the game mechanic, and doesn't require time dilation to work.
D':
@mojang
If you have a wormhole connecting 2 points that experience time at different rates, it can be used for time travel. There exist configurations for such a system where one can send energy back through time to a reciever that powers the emitter that sent the energy in the first place, and thus will create a positive feedback loop of exponentially growing energy reserves. At least until you reach the planck temperature, at which point I guess you'll make a new big bang?
Couldn't it also be explained if the Nether is in the interior of the overworld
Hey Austin, what‚Äôs the music you use in your videos? I really like them and wanna know what they are so I can listen to them myself.
The nether is hell. When you enter you get the achievement ‚ÄúWe need to go deeper‚Äù. The minecraft world has s floor of bedrock like the roof of the nether is bedrock, making it seem like it‚Äôs underground like hell. 

Then there is soul sand which is ONLY found in the nether. And when it‚Äôs underwater it‚Äôs screaming souls produce air bubbles. It is basically hell with horrific monsters inside and lava everywhere. 

Btw the nethers biome is called HELL
Is minecraft religious or what? Idk man
I‚Äôm just theorising
It seems it'd make more sense for them to flip the time-space-dilation. I mean it would explain why it's on fire constantly, and I'd probably name a place "Nether" too if it was practically inside a black hole. But no, they gotta make it a travel upgrade (and on that note if you can create wormholes why not just make them to your destination?)
Why is their lore in Minecraft
Um...
If E¬≤=(mC¬≤)¬≤+PC¬≤
It doesn't equal to E=mC¬≤+Root(P)C
It equals to E= Root((mC¬≤)¬≤+PC¬≤)


You would be correct if only it was a *(multiply) instead of (+)


EDIT1:
Some people kinda are insulting me saying I don't know Maths so...
What austin did was like saying: 25=16+9
And then 5=4+3
5=7
The heather and overworld are two different infinite dimensional planes, not planets in a solar system, so, ya, figure that out.
Actually, you travel faster in the Nether because the Nether is supposed to be the center of the Earth.  No hate, though.  :)
Minecraft doesn't confirm to the laws of the real world. You have to find in universe problems, not problems that Minecraft would have if it was not Minecraft.
Minecraft space has no curve. Recalculate
Dear Austin,

There is one aspect of the Minecraft universe that you forgot to factor in when theorizing the eventual doom of the Minecraft world and the black hole at the center of it. That small fact is that there is not a sun or a black hole at the center of the universe. It is the Minecraft world itself. Not only does the fact that the planet doesn‚Äôt rotate, or that the universe around it rotates perfectly in sync around it. (Points you back to previous game theory Minecraft videos.) The reason why the Minecraft world doesn‚Äôt crash in upon itself is because the planet itself is the center of the universe, and doesn‚Äôt collapse into itself because it surpasses its own shwarzschild factor.

Sincerly,
Nys Wolfe
I always wondered what happens when you delete a world...
Before Watching the Video: Is this going to be a theory about how the Nether Portal is actually and unstable Einstein-Rosen Bridge whose Schwarzschild would lead to it collapsing into a Blackhole and destroying the world?


Edit After Watching the Video: I was close.  Not bad.
this isn‚Äôt matpat.
It's a game though...
you do realise that in a sphere, the inner circle is smaller than the outer circle, thus if you travel on the inner circle, your position in relation to the outer circle travels much faster. and because nether is clearly hell, it is located underground, so it's a smaller circle inside a bigger circle, and that explains the reason why you travel longer distance on the ground in relation to the distance traveled in nether
Minecraft needs to die because of its new textures that are forced upon us
Austinnnn what did you do with your life
The Minecraft world is not spherical it's a cube, there is a banner you can make of the Minecraft world now and it's a cube.
I thought it was transporting you deeper inside the world. Like Hell is supposedly below out world. So the 1:8 would be because the arc length of a spherical world.
does austin use the same channel as pat
wait if the biggest star we know of is within that radius that makes it a black hole then... why isn't it? and why isn't our sun? I'm an English person okay I'm just curious about science and I don't understand math
Alberts mustache looks likes a Cheeto
i love austin videos
I always thought about it like this: The minecraft world is a sphere and the nether is deep down and the portals just move you deep underground and back up.
You didn't factor in that time in the nether is in flux.  The clock doesn't work.  Maybe the nether is already orbiting this theoretical black hole.  it just happens to never fall in.  that though is an idea on its own.
What if the nether is inside the overworld? If a smaller circle is inside a bigger circle, a degree change of a line would move along the smaller circle much less (let‚Äôs say 1/8th) than the bigger circle.
Smh
You forget one factor,  there is no circle in minecraft
Why not just place the nether beneath the overworld? Maybe the circumference at the depth of the nether is 1/8 of the circumference at the surface, and the portals are basically just elevators... Then the only energy it has to overcome is gravitational potential...


You just wanted an excuse to mention relativity in a video, didn't you?
This is your dumbest theory but we still love you
There's also the great fun fact that science hasn't dealt with known as the speed of light NOT being fixed at c, as proven by scientists at MIT bringing light to a complete stop. The only way around this would be that they brought the time progression in the chamber to exactly zero at a significantly smaller than theoretical cost, which a much greater difference than 1 - 8 ratio between locations....
I always imagined the Nether as hell, buried deep beneath the overworld. The portal would take you straight beneath you into the nether, and assuming the world is round, that would explain the difference in distance. The angle between the starting point, the center of the world and the ending point is constant, but because the overworld is above the nether, the actual distance is longer.
tell  me why can't we use other minecraft materials to make the nether portal
No ‚ÄúDear Markus Persson and Mojang,

Hi, it‚Äôs me! Austin!‚Äù? 

I miss that little intro. It‚Äôs funny
Finding curvature of a cubic world? You sure you're not going crazy, Austin?
Ok, so his math is based off the earth and nether orbiting the sun, but there are two big problems. One, we can‚Äôt be for sure that the nether is its own planet. It has a bedrock ceiling and floor, so it would have to be under something. And, in a different Minecraft video, made by MatPat, He concludes that the sun and moon and everything orbits the earth! How does the math work if this is the case?
If the nether were 8 times as small as the overworld, no time dilation would be needed to complete such a teleportation.
What about the end?

Or... Maybe it's because it's a fantasy game.
Nether is not a planet, soooooo all that work for nothing I guess.
Austin: I promise you it is not in the way you are thinking
Me: Is this going to be another "we fall into a black hole" episode?
Austin: WE HAVE AT BEST FOUR DAYS BEFORE YOU COLLAPSE INTO A BLACK HOLE
i thought the nether was under the overworld by a factor of 8. saw it on a comment and it made sense.
face palm
This is quite the interesting theory, however the more sensible one that I've always gone with is that when it means "hell", it means literally, and the minecraft world is just hollow, and on the inside is the nether, giving the incredibly high temperatures with just some mild assumptions (The main one being that you accept that bedrock forms uncollapsing, unbreakable structures, which is pretty rational considering how it behaves in the game). This was a great video though, thanks! :D
I'm sorry, I kinda fell off this time when it was assumed the nether and the overworld rotate around the same star, when they are within the game clearly classified as different dimensions, aka not part of the same universe.
I always thought the Nether was the Overworld planet's core
This could explain the 8:1 ratio, because you travel on a smaler radius due to being nearer at the planet's center of mass, right?ü§î
Mmmm but if the Minecraft earth is round it's just because the nether is closer to the center and the overworld is farther away from the center.
where is matpat
hmmmm.... But the nether is under the overworld. To make it easier, let's make the nether a 2D circle encircled by the bigger circle that is the overworld. They both turn 360 degrees but one is bigger so the circumference is also bigger. If you travel 1 degree in the nether you do too in the overworld, but the distance in the nether is far shorter. The netherportal just teleports you up and down.
I just thought the nether was underground. I don‚Äôt know how well I can explain it through the comment section, but I‚Äôll try.

What if (when you are transported to an alternate dimension i.e. the Nether) Minecraft‚Äôs Earth had a solid inner core with a surface area 8 times smaller than the planet? What if, by walking through the portal, you are being teleported straight down to your exact same location, but really deep underground? So let‚Äôs say you want to travel around 1% of the planet‚Äôs equator. The portal would teleport you to the Nether, and you would instead travel 1% of the CORE‚ÄôS equator. It‚Äôs the same percentage, but the distance on the core is going to be a lot smaller because the core itself is smaller than the entire planet. And that‚Äôs why, when you are shot straight back up again, you have travelled more above ground than you did underground.

Also, the word ‚Äúnether‚Äù means ‚Äúlower in position‚Äù. So, there‚Äôs that too.
Game Theorists: The Nether Portal provides the End to Minecraft


Notch: No, The End is The End
this video is buttcheek. the reason it's 8/1 is that the nether is below the surface of earth, making the radii two different lengths, but still ending up proportional when you travel up.
I hope that depression thing was a joke, sincerely: a fan of your sience stuff
this is just wrong
I can‚Äôt tell did you take in account the fact that both worlds are impossibly infinite
Who said that the Nether is a planet? It could be another dimension.
You realize that the neither is the center of the earth
you said that the nether is hell, hell (in my perspective) is closer to the core, so its smaller, the reason that one block in the nether is eight in the overworld, is because the nether is smaller......
unless that the nether portal shrinks you when you go in , that would explain the block change
Wait, isn't minecraft flat?
If Worm Holes--that are purely theoretical and have never been experimentally or observably been proven to exist--are fair game, then so are alternate/pocket dimensions. Seeing as if you get above the bedrock in the nether there is only a dark red with no deviations (Except maybe a bit darker at the horizon line) I'd say it's fair to assume that the Nether is not in the same universe as the Minecraft world, and is likely in a pocket universe.

Also, the bending of space-time is not the only way the nether could work. The Nether portal could have a built-in shrinking/growing component that changes the size of anything that goes into it before teleporting them. Sure, it's not likely, but seeing as Steve hasn't died yet by a black hole...
What if the Nether was at the center of the Earth so the area of land had a lower ratio. This also explains why the o overworld ends at bedrock but the Nether begins there
Where is mat pat !!??
The Nether is in another dimension. a sort of multiverse sort of thing. The End portal also exists as a dimension.  My thoughts on it where that it could be 3 Minecraftia universes each from different timelines where we are dealing with multiverse time not singular space locations.  Either way, the one correct thing is that the energy created and sustained by the portals will be world ending. So... oh well, guess Steve dies.
What if I don‚Äôt care
At 12:44 it says
E^2=(mc^2)^2+pc^2 and concludes that
E=mc^2+(‚àöp)c
but that can only happen is the momentum = 0
It doesn‚Äôt need to make sense
Where is matpat
Please kill me
Wow
next you should explain why blocks are floating in the Minecraft world
I wish you guys would credit the music used
austin you do realize that the nether is meant to be under the overworld meaning that the surface area would be smaller meaning less time to travel to a certain point
wow this video is incredibly unfunny
Eteeka
Well now you got me thinkin. What if the Nether and Overworld were two concentric spheres  where the Nether was the smaller on inside the overworld and the portals only acted like a fast travel elevator only  going up and down linearly. Meaning a short walk in the Nether leads to larger differences traveled above?
Would the heat from the nether go trough the netherportal?

I feel like you have fixated on spacetime distortions.
Multiplayer shows that the time in Nether goes at the same rate as in overworld. My theory is that the Nether is deep underneath the overworld and you teleport vertically, so there is less surface to cover when you're closer to the core of the planet you're on
I always kind of assumed that the nether was just what the overworld was to become, it is the future of the Minecraft world in it of itself.

the nether is located below bedrock on the home planet. it makes a hell of a lot more sense than whatever you're saying.
I think I'm gonna go to Matpat's fnaf theories instead... CYA!
Minecraft actually has a huge lore when you think about it.
Austin, you didn't take into account that the nether world has been described to be another dimension and there is a finite bottom layer of bedrock & finite top layer of the bedrock that makes it hard to accept that it's a planet, but then again, this doesn't absolutely prove that it's a another dimension. 


Also, please make a video about the Minecraft Over world and the End.
Well, this brings up some questions in regards to "Hyperspace travel", as in ships jump to a "different dimension" where the distance between here and there are significantly shorter. What would be the energy requirements be to create this gate between spaces?
But they aren't two different planets. The nether is the core of the planet. That's why there is bedrock both up and down.
Or the world could be a sphere where the portal transfers you to the middle and back up so one block = 8 blocks because the inside of a sphere is smaller...
What about the End City?

So umm... I believe the nether is actually right above the core of Minecraft, which would explain why it is 8 times faster to get around in the Nether. Because the Nether is probably 8 times closer to the core than the Overworld, it is 8 times faster to get around. I don't get the idea of even making a video about this, when it's actually that simple -_-
someone make this into a mod

The nether can't be orbiting a star because if you go above bedrock there's only darkness. I understand the nether as being below the void.
uhm Austin... the nether is under the bedrock in the normal world....
You can tell he's calculating in minecraft because at least half the number or letters in the formulas are SQUARED
Nice theory. Too bad it's completely false. First Nether isn't a different planet, but rather the core of the Overworld hence you get the achievement "We need to go deeper" after building a Nether portal. The portal itself allows you to pass through the bedrock with can't be mined without cheating. This is further supported by the fact that the top layer of the Nether is also made of bedrock. To bust your awful theory: the difference between the radius on the surface and down in the Nether explains the travel differences. Finally, you don't have to a genius to understand that "nether" means "below/lower/under" as in under the Overworld's bedrock. Sorry for the long comment, but I must point out misinformation when I see it and this wouldn't be a first time offense for this channel.

The minecraft world (before the game breaks badly) is 60Mil x 60Mil x 256. How was this not factored into this scenario? That is a huge footprint. Not only that but the 256 in that is only the buildable space. I've been 4000 blocks up in survival once and there was still plenty of space to go.

What would theass of the overworld be?

Also, every world is different
shoddycast x the game theorists
why this starting asking about meters and ends with time? time does not pass faster or slower , it is the same both side . It is theorized that the nether is an inner ring inside the world, so it takes less steps to cross in the circumference , and the portals are "just" gates to the surface on that angle.
And by the way , it takes some second go trough the portal, so it dont needs to be 8 seconds as you wait some of it to synchronize.
12:43 - wait... no... NO! You did it wrong... again! This is not how you do a square root
The square root of [(mc^2)^2 + pc^2] is actualy the same thing only with the symbol on it, the only thing you can do with this equation is to take out the c to make it look like this c*[m^2c^2 + p] (with a square root on top of it)
what if the void is a black hole?
Isn‚Äôt the Minecraft Universe a geocentric one though?
This entire theory hinges on the entire Minecraft universe being two planets orbiting a star, and I think it's been pretty much confirmed either that the nether is an alternate dimension or the center of the Minecraft world, NOT another planet. You need to make a follow-up video addressing this Austin! C'mon man your better than this!
I don‚Äôt know what is worse. The fact that Austin plays Minecraft on console or the fact that he made the algebra mistake at 12:44. 

¬´ Always. Double, triple check your work when working with relativity ¬ª lol
But what if the Nether is just closer to the center of the planet? Less ground to cover
I don't think this is the theory you should've gone for, Austin.
The assumption is that both of these worlds (Nether and Overworld) exist in the same timespace (same dimension) and for that to work, you've demonstrated that the Overworld has to exist near a gravitational well (a black hole) in order to reach the level of spacetime compression. But from your calculations, the Overworld has to be within a black hole's event horizon and is inevitably already gone whereas in Minecraft, everything is fine and days go by one by one, with both Sun and Moon appearing in the sky at equal intervals of time.



So, there has to be a different solution to this problem and that would've been a String Theory - a multidimensional theory.
Strings would be portals (p-branes or open strings) while their open ends would connect to d-branes (different dimensional planes).
Different dimensions allow for different spacetime sizes (compression level) because they act as two independent sheets of paper that have different sized grids drawn on their surface (1:8 ratio).

What if the sun is orbiting the minecraft world
i think hes forgetting that the nether resides below the overworld, and since that is closer to the core its circumference is (8x) smaller which explains how you get to places (8x) quicker
I'm pretty sure it's jut that the nether is located 8 times closer to the core of the planet than the overworld XD
I didn saw but probably he will say that will make a black hole
Austin where is the rich gaming character series?

i thought that you could run further in the nether because since it's underground it's circumference is smaller so you travel a bigger portion of the earth underground ....... does that make any sense ?
The earth is flat
I always thought that the nether was under the world and was smaller. It‚Äôs like how running on the inside track is faster
were is matpat
This doesn't really tackle the pesky issue of world space. Any given world in Minecraft is on a flat, practically infinite* plane. I don't think standard science is going to apply.


*I'm aware that it's blocked off at around 30 million blocks, but considering the algorithms in place to generate blocks and biomes, for any player it may as well be infinite.
Can you make a cod zombies theory?
magic exists in this world, so maybe the sun isn't a star: it is a spell cast by mages of old that is the exact same size/shape/mass/distance as the moon. Since it's on the EXACT opposite side of the world as the moon at any given time, that means the minecraft world is squeezed and stretched a little bit but otherwise it's fine

I love this show. It teaches me a lot about the science of gravity and Time Space.
I am trying to create a fantasy game that, even with all it's fantastical elements, is rooted more deeply to the Science of our reality.

I always see a lot of people complain about "how we use real-life logic and science" to messure things in a fictional game.
But that is what I come here for! I want to learn more of this to establish scientific formulas and equations to explain the crazy stuff within each world.

Like "How much muscle power must Artorias have to swing a sword that size with one arm?", "What sprint speed does Ornstein has?", "How big is Arnor Londor?", "What power does the Omega 4 Relay has to shoot a ship straight through the core of a Galaxy?". Questions like that bother me a lot, but I am not as skilled and educated enough to understand all the equations neccessary to figure that out.

Here however, I learn a lot of this.
So thanks for all the SCIENCE you've been delivering :3

"it is not what you thought" it is exactly what i thought it would be.
Or it‚Äôs just another reality
Does Austin have a personal channel?
I think you‚Äôre looking too far into this.
One sad part, the nether is moving faster than the earth. Take a clock out in the overwold. It moves at a normal pace. Do this in the Nether and it freaks the F out
What if the nether is just under the betrock of the minecraft planet? Would make sense why you would travel faster because minecraft surface would be around the nether. And at the highest point of the nether is betrock so it would make sense
All of this assumes Minecraft's Overworld and the Nether are different planets. It's a lot more sensible to consider the Nether as the Underworld. That's why it has bedrock tiles on its ceiling. 

You also don't have to have an advanced degree in physics to figure out the space time differences with my theory. It's simply the core turning up the gravity and causing the temporal delay.
Isn't it simply that the nether is closer to the center. thus any movement  translates to a greater distance when moved back to the surface?
The nether is another DIMENSION not planet

The nether is under or inside the minecraft earth which means the only thing that is actually true is that 8 blocks fit into 1 but it cant be true. If the minecraft earth is flat or square the nether is under or inside which means this makes no sense.
Wouldn't it be much simpler if the minecraft world was round and the nether portals just teleport you down or up?

Um... the nether is under the over world? If you dig straight down in the over world you hit bedrock, and if you dig straight up in the nether you also hit bedrock. Mind blown
Wouldn‚Äôt it just make sense that the nether is located underneath the bedrock as it is a substance you can‚Äôt mine ordinarily? 

I always thought it was insinuated to be hell, or at the very least underground. Wouldn‚Äôt that make up for the difference in size? 

Imagine the nether is a marble with the surface area of 1. Layer it with more and more tape let‚Äôs say, and eventually that outer layer will have a surface area of 8


No???
But the Minecraft world is flat
Pether nortal
The minecraft world happens to have an endless void below it. Maybe the minecraft overworld is already built around a black hole.
Wait. Is it just me, or did he go from trying to explain why one meter in the nether equals eight meters in the overworld to why one second in the nether equals eight seconds in the overworld?

But at least u explain the differences between mc and rl physics from rl side lmao
What if the nether is the ‚Äòsun‚Äô
The nether is just underground. The portal beams you up and down the sphere of the Minecraft world.
What about the idea that the nether is just hell. This would be more of a lore theory than a science theory.

Still fun to watch tho.
but isnt the nether underground? maybe its an "inner earth" deal were its deep enough that u travel the inner sphere 8 times faster. then the only problem is the space time fold which could be holding do to Quontome entanglement and a self sustaining geomagnetic anomaly harmonizing with the obsidian crystals
The End is scarier than The Nether, change my mind.
Austin I just want to say something 



THE OVERWORLD HAS NO GRAVITY!

If you think about it there are a lot of floating blocks in Minecraft so yeah
antoher petscop video matt? :D
12:43 That‚Äôs mathematically incorrect. You have to square root the whole thing. The Lower equation squared is E^2=(mc^2+cp^(1/2))^2=(mc^2)^2+pc^2+2m(p^(1/2))c^3
You made one flaw. That's thinking that Minecraft isn't a game..

I think we can all agree that this guy forgot that the Nether is basically intended to be the UNDERworld, as in at a distance underground where the Nether's size is 1/8th that of the overworld...
Ill just go to a different server
ORRRRR.. portals shink and enlarge the player . The player is 8 times larger in the nether therefore can travel quicker.
do you really belive the laws of science apply to a world (the nether) where a monster like the wither can originate from?
So if you use creative and fly too the top of the nether punch a hole into the bedrock it‚Äôs dark on the other side just like if you punch a hole in the over world so like most I assumed it was the ‚Äúhell‚Äù of Minecraft and as for this  it‚Äôs circumference would be 1/8th the surface.


So travel one block in the nether teleport too the surface and you‚Äôve just moved 8 blocks because it sends you strait up
You're waayyy off about Minecraft science aGaiN. The Minecraft world is round (which MatPat already proved) and the Nether is located deep underground (like Hell) approximately 7/8th's the distance to the planet's core. If the nether portal takes you straight down, then by walking around a sphere 1/8th the diameter and then taking a portal back up to the surface, you traveled eight times farther.
Austin not give you a panic attack but the nether is supposedly underneath the overworld
14:31 what are you doing?

Taking into account that the nether is the game's canonical equivalent to hell(and the possibility of it being in a different place in the spatial spectrum) wouldn't it be more forward thinking to view it as time being stretched out in the nether vs the overworld being compressed?  If I'm thinking about it in the right way(I'm slightly out of practice with relativity) this would potentially keep things outside the Shwartzchild radius and thereby making the seemingly astronomical amount of energy required to power a portal the biggest threat to the minecraft world.
This is what happens when your have a conclusion and work towards a problem.
YEs :D
Wrong. Minecraft is geocentric.
What if the neather is 8x smaller than the overworld and the portal just correlates to where it would on the overworld?
Austin the nether is in the core and when send you up  
Through the portal because of the small size it will send you couple of blocks away plus the ceiling is bedrock that could explain why the overworld floor is bedrock that could be the ceiling of the nether plus when you activate a map in the nether the area quite small so it can be explained that the nether is the core 
Like for Austin to see 
Ps I'm 12
Easy way to break your entire theory:

Nether is UNDER the surface. Below a sphere's surface you have less radius, thus less circumference. They aren't different planets you nutwad.
isn't the thought behind this that since the nether is hell, it is under the ground and walking around a ball is shorter if the radius is shorter.
Thumbnail: Mr. Stark....i dont feel so good...
But what if the portal never compresses space and just magically locks on to different spots
I just had a seminar on this exact topic yesterday so... doesn‚Äôt compression only happen in the same vector as the velocity of the object?
Hey game theory.... Can you do a theory about start Fox's out if this dimension level? I knew it's an old game but I gots to know!
In game ticks/weight values/gravity values, the fact that the Minecraft world is flat, the 20 minute day cycles, lack of sun in the Nether are not taken into consideration.
This is a crime. The nether portals have obsidian bricks...
WE ARE IN HELLISH NARNIA!!
My explanation for the Nether Portals easy transportation, is that the Nether isn't a planet at all but a different dimension to our own.
If the minecraft worlds were setup in the way proposed, this works out fine. However I do not think that is the case. I always thought that the nether existed under the overworld and above the end. And, according to another one of Game Theory's minecraft Theory, the minecraft world is round, then the circumference of the nether would be smaller. Thus decreasing the amount of time it takes for a person to travel "around" it. And Idk about time dialation. we would need to know how either a) how the clocks work in minecraft or b) figure out how nether time passes without the clocks because no matter the amount of time you spend in the nether, you come out of it with the same amount of time passed. For the compass, idk. Magnetism? I mean you are closer to the core so smaller movements could have bigger effects. The map; steve just cant make out landmarks and beds; magic!

Another thing two, my friend and I had an argument about this in class, and something you could add to the round Minecraft world theory, in order for it to stay infinite, is that it is a fractal sphere. Everything would still be proportional related to the nether and over world still.


And another thing. I see a lot of comments about blocks floating so gravity doesn‚Äôt really exist. I completely disagree with that because   Not only can the player jump and fall as well as entities, but sand, gravel, and lit tnt fall as well. Maybe this is a property of the Minecraft world. There are potions and magic so nothing is truly out of the question.

All that aside, I think this theory was more complicated than it needed to be

Minecraft is a popular game, It has bring joy to our lives, they should celebrate a 10 year anniversary.

But Steve can hold like... a kjxszilion gold blocks cant he? Why not just lift the entire fabric of reality?
It's so shocking how Minecraft is still relevant in 2019
I'm pretty sure the nether, lore wise, is the core of the minecraft planet. That's why you move faster. If not then I guess everything is fine because Steve has willed it that way.
I've been watching game theory for years and I still can't tell what's more entertaining, the facts or Austin's frustration/aneurisms üòÇ
Austin, you are my favorite narrator but you are so confusing when you talk! üòÇüòÇ
Dude, the Nether isn't a seperate planet, the Nether is an underground Dimension
The Nether, the final frontier

ohwait that's the End FUUUUUUUU-
Austin, the minecraft world is infinite, it wouldn't be possible for it to revolve aroud a star.
Omg  AUSTIN have you forgotten basic Minecraft logic, everything is orbiting around OUR WORLD. XD
Well the neither is the hell 
So it is just under the minecraft world 
Than 1 Meter in nether effects a bigger leighnt in the overworld
It even works with the Coordinates
Neather is deep in the earth, when it comes to a curve the neather would be closer together if it was in the center of the Minecraft ‚Äúplanet‚Äù. This would possibly work
Can you do a theory on why beds blowup in the nether
Hey. Instead of stressing yourself over these scientific sillies, why not consider this theory first.

Maybe nether portals just teleports you to underground and back to the top. And if we consider that a minecraft world is a sphere, then it would make sense. Because if you travel underground then teleport perpedicularly back to the top, you'll be able to travel fast. Because the circumference of underground is always lower that the top.

If only I can draw this here then it would be easier to understand. But I can't, so just try to understand it for yourself.
Wow, that was quite the video, I like how crazy you got and that you actually did all the formulas. Unfortunately there are several flaws with the logic you base your equations on since the minecraft universe doesnt necessarily follow our universes laws. 
1. Gravity is obviously not a very constant factor in minecraft
2. Time passes at the same rate in all dimensions in the mc universe, even if distance changes
Annnnd 3. The minecraft universe is either completely flat, hence the infinite world possiblity or 2 it is hollow and so massively large that you would never be able to travel around it. Ever.
I thought the Nether was just the underworld as in the literal inner crust of Minecraft. if its closer to the core than it makes sense why you could cover distance faster.
i have an easy explanation regarding the fact that one nether block traveled = 8 overworld blocks.
Let's assume  the minecraft world is round, the nether is actually deep inside the "minecraft planet".
Now as we go deeper, the radius decreases, the nether simply has a much lower total radius than the overworld.
Hence  1 block = 8 simply because of the lower radius.






sorry if i explained it badly lmao
Please keep doing this its better than other games you have done cough fortnite cough
Cool video, but isn't there a way to solve the relativity problem more simply? Just say that when you make portals they link the overworld and the nether in such a way that two points in the nether are linked to 8 times more distant points in the overworld, but it's just the portal linking, the actual distances are the same in the two worlds. The energy problem of the wormhole picture of the portals might remain, but's that cannot be avoided when dealing with portals. We can assume it's magic.

Also, isn't it assumed that the nether is below the overworld? Just like hell is often imagined to be below ground.

Apart from that, in the energy squared expression the momentum also goes squared.
Only true legends grew up with Minecraft. Like if you did!

How about different dimensions meaning different physics
In Minecraft ticks are the same in both the overworld and the nether so it may not be time related
Notch watching this video:






Wtf this guy is talking about lmao
this would be a really fun mod tbh
Around 6:30- why couldnt it be that nether is being stretched?

Edit: and if it were underground by the core of the earth it would make sense because the circumference of the crust is more than the core, so if you dug down to the core, and walked a mile, then dug straight up, wouldnt you come out farther than a mile from where you started?
This just sounds like a challenge for speed runners.
Why play Minecraft vanilla when you can play Minecraf with TERRIFIENG FREAKING SCIENCE

Where the hell is he getting that Minecraft worlds are in the same universe? It's another universe, and then the End is a third universe entirely. That or different Dimensions, who knows.

More importantly, the specific assumptions you place don't bear accepting your premise. It's more, "if Minecraftia and the Nether were in a solar system with each other...", which is emphatically not the case. The reality of the fiction would ask you to find what kind of space-bending system would/could exist in a way that supports the existing cosmology and finding issue with that, NOT making up your own cosmology and making a physics video about THAT and calling it a well-researched Minecraft video.

Usually like your episodes, but this one is just badly put together.
Since the Nether is based on literal hell, isn't the Nether at the center of the Earth? Meaning that the further you go down, the circumference of the Earth gets smaller and smaller?
So if you go far enough down, it will eventually be 1/8th the circumference of the Earth?
I always considered the Nether Portal to be like a fast pass to those depths, which, would, of course, have lava, burning rock and charred skeletons since those types of things are down there.......
Or the nether is in another realm and isn't influenced by our physics.... considering minecraft world is flat and not round
wait is G the same in the minecraft universe?
Nope. The nether is just 8x closer to the planet core. This is why it's much hotter than the overworld, why nether portals dont annihilate the world and why multiplayer works. You dont need to mess with time.
do more fortnite theory
Minecraft, meet Logic. logic, meet Minecraft.
I think you two will get along juuuuuust fine
The nether isn‚Äôt a planet, it‚Äôs another dimension which the portal grants a link between dimensions.
the nether is technically a dimension im v sure not a planet but daaaamn i still love these vids dude
No... just no... this is wrong on so many levels that taking the time to explain would take me all day. But suffice it to say, there are MANY ways that the Nether portal could work. Not just one. Thank you for the time you spent making the video but I just cant watch this one. It makes me cringe.
Uhh the minecraft earth is way bigger than our world.
Game theorist: it's just a theory

Me: it's just video game
BOOMER JUICE
Uhm, I think its supposed to be below the playable world, or "First frontier". In that case it would make sense, as you are nothing more, than in a lower "orbit".
12:44 not only is there some highschool level messup there, you wrote the equation down incorrectly. The relativistic energy equation is E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2 NOT pc^2. Also, you can't distribute a square root between the sum of terms. E=sqrt(m^2*c^4+p^2*c^2) is your equation
What if everything is wrong?
What if the Minecraft world is flat instead of round???  And acelerades through space?? That way gravaty would be the same and the sun and moon Orbit tue world? Anyone thought of this?
You didn't account for mine-craft gravity blocks literally flout!
Yeah but the time does not go faster when you are in the Nether, relatively 2 players will experience the same amount of time in and outside the Nether, invalidating the whole theory.
PETSCOP HAS MORE VIDEOS AND PYROCINICAL MAY MAKE PETSCOP 2
The question you should ask is why 2 planks give you 4 sticks?!?
But, If you're closer to the center of the planet, wouldn't that be enough to make up the Difference?
Like, If I'm at the core of a planet (like I always assumed the nether was) and I travel 1-meter, wouldn't that equal a longer distance at the surface of the planet?

Yes but didn't the sun and moon orbit the uh "planet" in minecraft...

Could this explain why the sun rises and sets so quickly in Minecraft? And what about the Moon?

Wait if the nether is basically Minecraft hell shouldn't there be a heaven to?
what about end portal?
So like do Minecraft days factor into this? And also the nether is the core of Minecraft/An alternate dimension....
An alternative idea: The Nether is under an inverted contortion of spacetime, so that it is being expanded instead of the overworld's space being contracted.
Has Austin thought about the fact that the Nether might just be below the crust of the Earth? That would explain why you travel much farther per step in the Nether...
the nether could be the portal to the future
Wait, every time we mine resources off the surface of the Earth, we make our planet smaller. SOOOO... We are slowly getting closer to making our planet smaller that the size of the area where gravity would collapse our planet into a black hole literally sucking in and destroying everything going slower than the speed of light.

Edit: i would suggest a theory. Minecraft's world is tidally locked orbiting just 256 meters above a black hole, with the sun orbiting around the overworld.
Oh and the nether is in a parallel universe orbiting a super-dense black hole at near-light speed, causing time to dilate.
The math doesn't check out, does it? Welp.

Huh...so that's why the Minecraft trial version only allowed the player to play for 5 mc days before it had the player make a new game...everything makes sense now
The Nether is not a planetary body. Exists in the same space on a separate, stretched plane. Simple.
Some one who starts a video like that needs to be my friend
Simple solution to this problem:

The Nether is deep underground. That means it is below the Minecraft surface, and also means that you become closer to the planet's core, making the radius of the circunference of your movement around the planet itself smaller as a consequence, and thus allowing you to travel greater distances relatively speaking mantaining the same speed
There is no time contraction, only length. This indicates it likely has nothing at all to do with relativity and that your analysis is pure garbage with no relevance at all.

It is actually quite simple.
The Nether is BENEATH the over-world.
The minecraft overworld is a large cuboid (as shown in the minecon things).
The nether is below the over-world as hinted at by the "we have to go deeper" achievement.
In fact it is one 8th of the distance from the centre.
What this means is when you through the portal to the nether you go 7/8 of the way to the core. When you take the portal back you go to 8 times your current distance from the core.
This is what causes the 1/8 ratio.
No relativity required.
This is a sham its simply the nether portal picking a coordinates that would be relative to the other plane you are teleporting to and can be solved by simply stating that the nether is 1/8 the size of the overworld so when you travel back the relative coordinates would be 8 times further and both planes experience time at the same rate.

Edit: this can be proven by the fact that when you make a nether portal within 8 blocks of another in the overworld all portals go to the same position in the nether.
Tbh, I thought he was gonna talk about something to do with the effed-up clocks in the Nether hinting at timey-wimey stuff...
Also, I hypothesized that the 1:8 ratio thing had to do with the Nether being deeper into the ground compared to the Overworld, so that (in a globe) it would take less travel to get to the other side of the globe with a smaller circumference (which something closer to the planet‚Äôs core would have)
Me: sees math
Also me: fjguftwhfvtgeuvftyfet
But still watches anyway
Couldn't it be a effect of nether being 8x smaller than the overworld and the teleportation working on rotation of the spheres? So from "northpole" to "northpole"?
11:10  Wow! Finally someone took a high quality picture of a black hole!
I thought it would just be deep within the void/planet of minecraft and had 8 times smaller curvature and just teleported you up and down.
edit: also, nothing ever says that time flows differently in the nether. At least from what I now.
Hey austin are you ever gonna be on gtlive?





Like if you want austin to be on gtlive
my brain hurts
Or...or....OR...




Or it could simply be because the nether is far underground and like in real life, travelling closer near the center of a sphere is more efficient/faster than travelling on the surface. In fact airplanes do this all the time when they travel long distances. It's not bending the curvature of spacetime or whatever. It's simply how spheres work üëå But hey it's just a theory, a Game Theory right?
actually portal is just elevator :D deeper down u are less block u have to go :D not that hard
But they're on the same planet...
Austin: *Explains everything*
Me: WRONG. ITS BECAUSE ITS A GAME. HAHAHAHAHA
AUSTIN: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If it makes a difference. The tick count isn't altered in the over world if you're in the nether and vise versa, but if two people are in the nether and the over world at the same time. Time doesn't change. (Also since they both have infinite land it means that they're not planets instead they're dimensions on an infinite plain where space-time can't effect it.)
The Nether is a whole other dimension, not a planet...

I don't even rage at the whole "its a fake f*king game" thing he does it so well
Y'know the first thing that came to mind. The Minecraft world being round theory.
What next came to mind. Traveling over a radius that is closer to the center of a sphere compared to the external diameter.
Put two and two together and I'm implying that opposed to seeing it as an alternate dimension, I'm looking it as a portion of space within the Minecraft world/globe where traveling along the new found diameter will practically allow you to cover more distance in less time
But Minecraft doesn‚Äôt have gravity
umm... according to a poster made by mojang, the nether is under the minecraft world, and not at the same time.
Why did you end the video with "Sincerely".....you didn't start it as if you were writing a letter.  Always triple check your work Austin.
Stargate!!
Haven‚Äôt watched the video yet but clever title.
there is another way 8 blocks in one place equals 1 block in another. the core of the minecraft planet is the nether, which makes perfect sense as to why it is so red and hellish.
There are other ways to dilate time. One could be orbiting a spinning black hole which causes a bunch of wonky things to happen. By your math, it would be impossible to have a situation in interstellar where 1 hour = 7 years, but if the black hole were spinning fast enough it‚Äôs quite possible.
So it‚Äôs simple then, minecraft tidally orbits a spinning black hole underneath y=0 and the sun orbits very far away where the moon orbits exactly opposite. Makes perfect sense.
Wait why would the moon have phases?
o h   s h i t
A group of scientists on YouTube should just be called "The Life Theorists"
The travel mechanic in the nether is used a lot in 2b2t
What if i just say that nether is inside of the minecraft planet and so it's smaller than overwolrd making traveling faster in nether. 
So here in simple if you have two balls one small and one large and small is inside the large one. Travelling one meter on top of the small one and going straight up to the large one, makes you move way longer distance on larger one.
but what if the nether is just underneath the normal Minecraft world?

If that world were a sphere and what the nether portal did was nothing more than just teleport you closer to the center of the sphere, then it would basically be teleporting you to another smaller concentric sphere. if we then traveled, for example, half of the way across this smaller sphere and built another nether portal that teleported us back up, we'd be halfway around our bigger "overworld" sphere, but we'd have traveled less then what it would take if we had just walked there.

If the radius of this smaller sphere were 8 times smaller than the radius of our bigger sphere, then traveling some distance on our smaller sphere and then teleporting away from the center would mean we would have traveled 8 times that distance in our bigger outside sphere.

So maybe the nether portal just teleports you 8 times closer to the center of the Minecraft world.
Please make a mod
My headcanon is that the nether is close to the core of the minecraft planet, and the nether portals only transport you vertically. So like the nether portal is like a really fancy ladder, so you enter the portal, get transported down into the nether, walk a shorter distance on a tighter circle, then because of geometry have travelled the same angle across the inside sphere and outside sphere (say 2¬∞) but that angle equates to more block distance traveled on the outside then the inside, then take another portal pair back up, which (excluding the vertical portal warps) travels you further across the sphere with the same walking distance.

Your problem is that you are thinking of the nether as a different planet instead of a different dimension
This guy did something stupid a while ago so I stopped watching him.
But I don't even remember why I wasn't supposed to watch his vids, someone remembers ?
Or maybe they just transport you down into the planet where the radius is smaller and therefore the surface area is smaller.  You would just have to go about 7/8th of the way into the planet to pull it off.
There is an entire mod that exists that is based off of the concept of the Nether realm completely overwhelming the world. It's called The Betweenlands, and while i'm not particularly fond of it due to the horror-based nature of the mod, it's extremely well done.
So baaaasicallyyyyyy.... The whole video is wrong.... rip.. Lol the whole video I was just thinking, "wait but time doesn't change when you go in the Nether.. wut." Then I went to the comments 'n people are like, "Definition of Nether is, 'lower in position'" and, "It's just the core of the overworld!" and, "see? the bedrock ceiling"

Love your content guys. ‚ù§Ô∏è
That was interesting, now try doing those numbers while calculating in for multiverse theories.  I say this because according to Minecraft lore, overworld and the nether are two different universes entirely, not two different planets.  

Also, why do I enjoy episodes with Austin more than episodes with MatPat?
Huh weird i always assumed the neather was in the center of the planet and thats why its 8√ó smaller on a map because its in the center and i assumed you travel faster because if your closer to the core of a sphere or something and you start walking its gonna be less distance then if you walked on the surface i didnt realize this video as a possibility but hey im having fun watching the video playing the game and writing this comment so even if im wrong its all good
False earth isn't round...
#1. pretty sure that you got it backwards, bud, as the time would be running slower in the overworld with that arrangement.
#2. even if you had that right, you have to factor in both GR AND SR, as GPS satellites do.
#3. even if you did THAT, the nether is technically below the overworld (my evidence for this is the nether has TWO bedrock layers, one at the upper and lower block limits; it is not much, but it kind of disproves the "separate planets" theory), so there goes the thing about needing SR; we only need GR; the difference in distance can then be explained by "larger circles have larger circumferences than smaller circles," and the error in compasses can be explained by core stuff. 
#4. IF THIS WERE THE CASE, IT WOULD BE MUCH, MUCH WORSE!!!!
This is all of course assuming that the minecraft world follows the same laws as our own.
3:45 Ok Austin my friend, A STARGATE HAS 9 CHEVRONS, NOT 8, WHAT IS THIS!?
12:41 Uhhhh, Austin???
the P*c is whole squared
so E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2

Also who the hell taught you to square root like that? it's horrifying!!

PS : reverse engineering your mass to be 6kg (i dont why you took that), the actual energy with the correct equation is 4.314√ó10^18 J, just a smidge less than what you predicted, and roughly two-fifths of all energy the solar energy that strikes the earth. Yeah
What about the end?
What if perception of time is vastly different for the people of a Minecraft world, where we would perceive hours upon hours of gameplay they would only pass a time equivalent to a few seconds for us
So, I think it's also good to point out that Minecraft has life, an ecosystem even. How is that even possible under those kinds of conditions? Life in of itself is rare, as planets have to be within the goldilox zone of a star. So how exactly does that work?
Time still occurs at the same rate. Distance changes but time does not between nether and overworld
I guess this explains the demo mode lasting 5 in-game days, because that's how long it takes until the world implodes
Is that Aquarium from The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint Sa√´ns I hear?
Screw Majora's Mask, I gotta survive 4 days in Minecraft
this vid is so wrong on so many different levels  that it has gone full circle and i now accept it as canon
So uh,is the overworld 8 seconds FASTER or SLOWER than the Nether? You never seemed to stick with either...
I assumed the Nether was below the surface of the Minecraft overworld.
As you get closer to the core, gravity increases and dialates Time. Then as for the travel distance difference. If the world is "round". Draw two lines from the center to edge. The angle between the 2 lines could be whatever but let's say it's 1 degree. The angular distance between the lines increase as you go from the center to the edge.
7:48 dab
or the nether could be 8 times smaller and the portals go to the same relative position when you light them on both planet/dimensions
Alternative theory: What if the nether is not on a separate object, but instead on the same planet just deeper inside. The portal simply teleporting you directly downwards heading towards the core. If that's the case it'd explain the circumference segment difference by 1 square to 8 squares due to lower radius.
Even if it was not a separate dimension, it would be closer to the "hollow earth theory" with the nether being something in the mantle or core of the planet. Now just figure out why you don't spontaneously combust and we are good.
dude its a video game
what is the song at the end?
and wat if nether not iwen within the same fizikal unewers
I am nowhere near a sceintist so please correct me if I am wrong (I will not be offended)

3 things we know:
~Matter(and energy) cannot be created or destroyed




If the matter cannot be destroyed when it is taken into a blackhole, Then it must me going somewhere. Which means there is atleast one more spacail direction we are not aware of. Unless matter is just dissapearing a spherical hole in our reality. No matter how you look at a blackhole, I think it makes that the hole is in 4D space.

-If you believe blackholes are rips in space-time. Then where would the rip lead?

-If you believe blackholes are wormhole-esque tunnels in fold of space-time. (Meaning there would be whiteholes.) Then where does that tunnel travels through?

-If you believe blackholes are just the massively heavy object creating a long indent in our fabric of space-time. (Like a pocket.) Then what direction does that pocket inverts into?

There seems to be an extra dimension to things. If there is extra dimensions... Then maybe the Minecraft Earth is in that extra dimension. Extra space=extra time. Then netherworld could be in actual 3rd space.
 Also as a ball would just look like a circle in a 2D creature's line of sight. How would we know if we were in a perfectly still 4rth dimension?
I think I will call this minecraft theory:
But a 8 tick delay in the overworld is still a 8 tick delay in the nether, so the time theory doesn‚Äôt check out

Read this before you say the ticks change too: if you place a dispenser in the over world on a 8 tick delay and a dispenser in the nether with a 8 tick delay then they both fire at the same time (if triggered like at the same time)
Why did I even watched this? I only understood a quarter of what he said.
I thought it was a dimension and there is bedrock all around it so how do sun?
@The Game Theorists
What if then Nether is just 8 times smaller than Minecraft?
And the portal makes you tiny?
Then the Nether could even be inside the "Minecraft Planet (Cube?)", right?
Austin, did you have fun doing the voice, you know, for us, like in 3:46? I know you did...
Or the Nether is inside Minecraft World and is a lot smaller. The smaller radius of the inner sphere would translate to a larger distance traveled on the upper sphere.
Austin: To price that each and every Minecraft world you build is doomed (5:32)

Me: Is building a Minecraft world as I‚Äôm listening to this

Also me: 
(Starts video) "lemme guess, black hole?"
Not gonna lie Austin you and your SCIENCE are the main thing that keeps me coming back to game theory. i don't dislike matpat but the meme stuff can be kind meh sometimes.
alright guys crazy idea but what if the nether under the Bedrock
Austin's madness makes for a great 16 and a half minute video of blocky entertainment.
This would be the last place I would have expected to get a revision on my radiation and relativity module that is due for an exam in 2 weeks, thanks Austin.
Nether is another Dimension.
What if the Nether is just a giant dimension, which alters your own size as well
Nether isnt a planet,how could you just assume that ,when you literally cannot ever see a sky or "ground" in the nether
Austin, Hell is the center of the Earth. Thus, it has a much smaller surface area than Earth's exterior, with the same shape. Not to mention gravity is stronger closer to the center. Thus, if you enter and exit the interior in a straight line, and travel across the center in between, the equivalent travel on the surface would take longer per forward mile traveled.
92 Earth hours, huh?

A full day-night cycle in minecraft is 20 minutes.
1 hour=60 minutes
60/20=3 minecraft days per hour. 
3*92=276

You have 276 days to prepare.
Nether is not a New planet.
Its that place you reach if you Culd dig throu the bedrock in The over world.

Think of the mine craft world as a planet, the owerworlds sircumference is so much bigger then the Nether that 8 blocka worth of travel equals one block in The Nether.

The portal is like lifts/teleporters, you go straight upp or down.
You're not matpat
Just pour water on the portal lol
Or if the nether and normal world are different planets, the nether can just be smaller and the portal takes you to the same latitude and longitude of each planet
What if, theoretically, the nether is just below the overworld, and portals send you straight up (in a globe shaped earth)
I think the equation on 12:44 is wrong
Please give summary
Wait, the nether isn't on the same planet as the Minecraft overworld? I thought that the nether was underneath bedrock level ("We need to go deeper" achievement was what made me think that) I always made a rationale that the nether portal teleported you underground closer to the center of the planet in line with what would be considered the radius of the planet (another theory stated that it was a sphere). This way, traveling along the "curvature" of the nether, being much smaller in circumference, saves you time if you assume that you always teleport to the surface relative to the angle at which the radius can be drawn through your character from the center of the planet, therefore covering more distance.
Isn't it a separate dimension??


Disconnected (except for the portal) from our own.
Thing is, In the Nether and Overworld Time passes at the same speed. The Penomenon we got here is Superpostion with a seperate Reality Layerd though another Reality with The Portals being Artificially made breachpoints between the two. View the Process as a Curved mirror just that its surface is the portals wer're talking about.
I knew something was wrong with Minecraft's space time !! , Good job Austen !!
Or maybe it's just a video game with video game magic?
The intro song. I need to know what it is
A much simpler solution is that the Nether is 1/8th the size of the overworld. This way the Nether is scaled like a map or globe, no relativity required. The compression might also explain the heat and lava.
So basically, Minecraft is broken.üòÇ
Hey what about  the END!
I just came up with a theoretical idea for being able to obtain the energy required to do this more efficiently. Create a device that defragmentation the energy or sort of condenses it and consolidates it so that you can use way more in less space. Kind of like increasing the memory of a computer and increasing its power but not in the traditional sense. Or better yet create a device that amplifies the energy
then again the minecraft world  could never be orbiting because no matter where you are the minecraft time never changes
But Austin didn't MatPat say that the Minecraft solar system was a geocentric one?
where is matpat?
Game theory can you make hat in time theory
have you considered that maybe the nether is below the mine craft world??? i mean walking around the earths core would be faster than walking around the crust...
Me:  OOh!  Minecraft!  clicks on video


Also Me:  Learns about the theory of relativity, discovers how light travels, the effects time and space, and inter-dimensional travel...


This YouTube channel is amazing XD
Yo where's the next episode of my favourite show, LOOKING AT HOW MUCH VIDEOGAME CHARACHTERS MAKE MONEY?!?!?!
I dont think austin knows that the nether is under the overworld
At 12:44 thats... not how square roots work
have you considered that the nether is actually underground and the portals just take you from the surface to nether and vice versa with the nether being merely 1/8th the surface area?
What!üò±
Wtf E is equal to sqrt ( (mc^2)^2 + pc^2)
One problem: when playing on multiplayer, players in the Overworld and the Nether experience time the same way
Did MatPat once prove that the Minecraft unit was a Geocentric solar system? And couldn't that change something?
Hey mat! Do you think you could make a video on Danganrompa?
I found out a amazing thing about fnaf 
In fnaf 3 trailer they are referring to Mikeal mafton by the line I always come back
So what I‚Äôm gathering from most of your videos is that anything in a game that messes with physics usually turns into a doomsday device
or you know... it's just magic which ignores conventional science? Just saying lol, I couldn't imagine having an anxiety attack over every game I played. Still entertaining though keep up the good work Austin!
What if you  get bigger in the Nether
I like to think of "the simplest solution" to some problems. In this case, I think I have it. The problem began with the difference in distances as you move from one place to another in the Nether corresponding to 8 times that distance in the normal world. The answer I think is simple.

The overworld is on the surface of a spherical planet (Proved by MatPat) and the nether is 1/8th the distance from the surface underground. IIRC the "elevation" of a nether portal does not correspond to it's elevation in the overworld.

So, yeah, that's it, simple.
Holy crap that's one hell of an equation üòØüò®
That thumbnail reminds me of Avengers Endgame
The Nether is a different dimension than the Overworld.
Nice use of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns‚Äô ‚ÄúCarnival of the Animals‚Äù in the beginning. Quite fitting
It's also important to note that, if the nether is supposed to be the underworld, it could be underground, and that it's not a question of time, but just distance. If you're walking around the Earth's core, you're going to be traveling a much shorter distance than if you were walking around the entire Earth. This is plausible given the idea that the nether actually doesn't have a sky and is instead just one big cave.
Have you thought of the possibility that the nether is just another planet and because of a random something in the universe the portals are the things that makes the difference, not the worlds themselves?  I mean, it not time that is bending its space. So if you had in a theoretical world a portal at place 1 in the map and aportal in the place 8 in another world and they whould be linked it doesn't matter if you also have two portals in the place 4 and in the place 32 that are linked... the reason could be the way the nether portals work or their aiming abilities... maybe in one world there is a [compleate the missing] (magnetic? Cosmic?) Point every 1 block and in the other every 8 blockes so naturally if you aim for the same amount of [compleate the missing] points in the other world you get this effect...
I know you like explosions, but i think my theory is possible (and maybe a bit more practicall sceince every day in minecraft is 20 minutes and the world record a few years back was one day and 10 minutes without stopping).
i mean everyone else already said it but its an entirely different dimension, maybe a pocket dimension or something
Who came here for the thumbnail and said I don't feel so good Mr notch
the right side of the sun bothers me immensely
you over thought this way too much. although this would make for an interesting game mod
Bruh speak english
3:20 or the nether could be closer to the overworld' planet core duuhhh idot
Umm, minecraft is not a normal planet. Here is a why:

-it is flat
- the sun and moon and stars orbit around it, not it around the sun
-the nether is a parallel dimension, with a roof and a floor
-they are squares.

The nether must be like the upside down, it corresponds to the overworld
Why do scientist name stars,planets,black holes and galaxies weird
This isnt a problem. Speedrun.
The Nether is a completely different dimension
I also thought the Nether was the core, or another dimension
That's kinda wrong,since nether would be closer to the sun since it's hot and you would have to switch some of those equations or whatever you're doing
I'm sorry, but you sounded crazy as       
f*** when you were doing this.
That's... not how black holes work.
I always knew





Minecraft is flat
Science is the exploration of the limits of reality.  Magic doesn't have limits.  That's why it's magic.
I have a theory , Nether is under the overworld. Because, as you know there's bedrock in under of the overworld and there's bedrock in top of the nether. You can't switch dimension without a portal.
could you be more wrong
Or maybe the Nether is literally 'hell' and so it's (traditionally) way underground. and because the Minecraft world is a sphere (VSauce), it's like the inside of turns, where the further towards the center you go, the shorter the distance, and the faster the trip.


But then again, there are multigender cows, cows with mushrooms growing out of them, green pig abominations that explode at you, dragons, armor and weapons literally made of diamonds, zombies, and 6-foot tall jointless men made of cubes so really anything can happen.
0:53 you forgot Bob the builder
When you have no idea what he is saying
I always assumed the nether-overworld distance thing was because the nether was much closer to the overworld planet's core, far below the bedrock.
Well, what do you think happens when you delete your world?
I can explain it in one sentence, the overworld is 8 times bigger than the nether.
How does 1/8 blocks translate to 1/8 units time?
?????
The game eventually does slow down like you‚Äôre being pulled into a singularity, but you just refresh your instance üòÇ
This whole thing made me think about the alternative Cosmological Model "Janus".
Model which is trying to fix the dark matter and dark energy issue by suggesting a twin universe (not really, but nicer image) in which the speed of light would be higher than on our side, and where distances would be shorter.
what if the nether is just earth's mantle/core
The thing we always forget she actually researchers these years the fact this man takes time out of his day to make these videos let that sink in
I'm still trying to figure out how the skeletons' creepers and zombies are around?
I always thought of the nether as the land beneath the bedrock you can't mine through. The achievement "We need to go deeper" implies such a theory.
ok so theres two rebuttals to your  theory. Either

a. the nether is the core of the planet, and is such relatively smaller, making the distances traveled in the nether 8 times the distances in the overworld. 


b. the nether is always referrred to as a dimension by mojang staff, and if such it may not follow our laws of physics.
Or you know... you could just... watch Avengers Endgame where Ant-Man/Scott Lang just explains it in a nutshell using particles and atoms, also because Endgame is somewhat entertaining.

EDIT: If I'm wrong which I believe I am then tell me because I cant remember what he was talking about, I was too focused on how he escaped the particle dimension

EDIT: AGAIN.
Ok... I like your math and what not... but your forgetting something. We‚Äôre not trying to find time... it‚Äôs distance. Time moves the exact same in both words. Want to know how I can prove it? Simple.... lava flow and multiplayer. Ever notice that it takes lava the same amount of time to fall in the nether as it does in the over world. Also, multiplayer... that self explanatory.

Also, the Nether isn‚Äôt a planet, as shown by the fact it has a ceiling of bedrock with an infinite void above and below it. If anything in the over world below it‚Äôs bed rock you have a void, then beyond that void is the ceiling of the Berger‚Äôs, then below the nether is the void which contains the end. 

If anything a more logical conclusion as to why the over world is 8 blocks longer, think of the overworld as a planet, then stick the nether in the earths crust, aka, where hell is and what the nether is based on. Since the radius of the over world is now larger than the nether, the circumference is also bigger, and as such the distance in the over world is longer. 

I don‚Äôt know how you over looked this and got to the conclusion of black holes... but it‚Äôs literally just that simple.
Orrrrrrrrrrr the nether is underneath the overworld, so being closer to the center of the planet you travel faster because all the portals go straight up to the overworld crust. Being inside the crust would 100% explain the magnetic anomalies with the compass, as the mantle's flow of molten rock makes the magnetic field, but not the time anomalies.
This is so wrong on sonmany levels
You took the square root of E¬≤, but the formula is a sum, you can't just take the root on both terms !
What happened to the richest video game series, Austin?
Austin's not yelling with a hoarse throat now! he's tolerable and this video is actually good :D
Even if the Nether wasn‚Äôt a different dimension, couldn‚Äôt it just be located in a different star system? I think that might help to solve your black hole problem
Isn't it canon that the Minecraft world is a sphere and Nether is deep underground? Thus a portal just transports you down, and as you might imagine, 1 meter on a small sphere's surface may very well translate to 8 meters on the surface of a very large sphere.
Matpat has already proved that the Minecraft Earth is round and then that there is like hell and is like Underground so what if it's just so deep down that 1 block is 8 blocks because if you do the math it works out
Me: sees it's Austin. 


Goes into comment section to say the thing every one says. Then turns volume down and presses play. ;)
P isn't square rooted. The full formula is actually:

E^2=(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2
Minecraft has infinite energy. Just turn on a switch and BOOM, infinite energy.
The nether is different dimension, not a planet, and also the overworld is most likely the center of the solar system.
Austin powers reference by austin....NICE
I left 2010 nostalgia for this it better be good
15.20 quartering a quarter gives 1/16 not 1/8 sorry bro
THIS IS A FICTIONAL WORLD THAT REAL LIFE PHYSICS DON"T HAVE TO APPLY TO! Though, I still do love your vids (Matpat is better though)
3:56  I totally have that book for my baby. It's great. Lol
I always assumed it was somewhere deep within the Earth's core... the Nether that is.

Petscop! Petscop! Petscop!
Hmmm people say that the nether isn't a planet its another demension
BUT
Another demension is another universe which has planets and something with a surface and lava and any heat source has to either be on a planet or a star/blackhole
But what if 8 overworld blocks aren't squishing in to a nether block but if a nether block was stretching out over 8 overworked blocks
Imagine the minecraft world is a planet. imagine that is kind of a sphere, just like Earth.
What in Nether portals just take you underground.?

After all nether means under (or something like that). If it took Steve you down so the radius form the center of the micraft world is 1/8th of the complete planet, you cold travel 1 block down there and an equivalent of 8 blocks up in the surface. That way you wouldn't beak the universe (except for the energy spent in each trip up and down).



And... Steve jumps to the same height when is on the surface and when its on the nether, so we have to imagine that the density of the world above is almost nothing than what remains beneath.

There is a problem though: that would imply that the minecraft world is a huge planet with a huge mass that won't match with the falling speed, unless... the atmosphere is really viscose alowing Steve to reach verry quicky to its terminal velocity when falling. That would also mean Steve is a super-human that can jump and walk making an incredible force to overcome the atmosphere.

BUT... if that is true, it would explain why he can carry so much mass...

So...
The micraft world is almost a very, very big sphere, with a really dense core, and somehow that system is stable and it has an incredibly viscous atmosphere. Steve is a super-human that can jump making an incredible force too, the ground is not dirt as it has to hold up. The amound of and bricks make more sense, thhat you can find "a lot" of diamonds near the surface also majes sense, as the preasure is higher. And Steve would be able to carry that much gold because of his super-strengh. And the nether is underground, you can get to it using portals that have  a hidden power supply.


I think that covered all, or i'm wrong? (The micraft world can't be a cube or the fluids wil go to the center of each face.)


EDIT: I forgot to add that the atmosphere at the nether should behave kind of a non-newtonian fluid to keep the proportions of each jump and terminal velocity. I hope than the world I created with this theory doens't collapse into a black hole or start a fusion reaction at the core. Didn't make the math for that.

PD: Sorry for my bad english in case it was. It is my second language.
I cant stand when you feature the other guy, please stop
I....don‚Äôt get it
This is where lag comes from
Welp, if you get back to your nether portal after a long day in the mines of hell and it is deactivated, you know what happened.
Time to build a dir-oh whoops accidentally warped space time:P
Austin..... Minecraft is back and coming from more than one dimension..... Great video btw
12:44  square root a + b is not equal to square root a+square root b
Now wait for hytale, and the theories will be rolling.
We say: Who is the richest videogame character?

Game theory: We're lazy. Take a random theory.
12.45 sqrt(a+b) is not equal to sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) bro or is it an approximation?
When you said energy... i already new it
Hey what if the nether world is 8 times bigger than overvorld prowe me whong guys
When the nether is a different dimension 

New video "Minecraft is doomed"
energy = minecraft 2.0 confirmed for pc
I always thought the nether was underneath the overworld. Hence the name "nether"
Hey matpat what happened to the doki doki spin off
Someone should totally make this idea into a mod. 92 hours to escape to the nether
The Nether would make more sense if it was inside the main planet and had a radial transformation ratio of 1 to 8, wouldn't be doomed now would it ? but I'm sure you thought of this first.
So another Game that sucks because it isn't historical accurate
Ax, they're everyone's hours.
Guys the nether isn‚Äôt underground or anything it‚Äôs a different dimension
What about The End dimension?
what if the minecraft world is just 8x larger thus causing the nether portals to have to compensate for the distance traveled?
The nether is a dimension
What about the fact that the Minecraft planet obviously isn't Earth though? 
Every day in Minecraft is only 20 minutes for us here on Earth, so 1 Day on Earth = 72 Minecraft days. 
So, if your data at 14:35 says that we'd only have 92 Earth Hours left, (4 Days) then in Minecraft you would actually have 276 days left. Almost a year. 


Besides, who plays one world for 200+ days in-game? I usually quit after I beat the ender dragon b/c I get bored by then. Unless it's creative mode, but then you just pause time right? The day/night cycle is too annoying when you're trying to build epic things and at night you can't see anything
i know the nether is a different dimension and all, but what if it was just on the inside of the planet so it was just smaller and that's  why it takes less time to get places
6:53 You just broke "The Minecraft Planet Is Round" Theory.
What if the surface area of the nether is just one eighth the size of Earth. 
You're assuming it's time that has changed rather than the relative space of the two locations. 
For all we know, the Nether really is hell and it's beneath the crust of the Overworld.
*Sees that the clock goes crazy in the nether*
- "I could make a video out of this"
Yes the Minecraft world will end 





If it was on DEMO
what if the nether portal is a time machine?
This video contradicts the theory of the Minecraft world being round
Finally a theory I can watch with no spoilers.
Isn't a block in the Nether = 512 blocks in the Overworld?  Seeing as it's compressed along the X, Y and Z axis?
Mr. Notch, i don‚Äôt feel so good
The space-time dilation doesn't make sense because time flows normally on the overworld when you're in the nether.
Yay finally a minecraft theory
My Christian minecraft server had died of sadness, due to this video. Thank you so much!
First: the Netherportal could simply use the thermal energy of the Nether. The air is so hot that taking a bucket of water with you evaporates instantly giving you temperatures well over 100¬∞C which is the boiling point of water. So maybe use 500¬∞C for a whole bucket to evaporate without a trace in that small fraction of time. Such heat is probably enough to keep the Nether Portal up and running. 
Also Netherstone can burn infinitely so we can assume that a single block alone would have enough energy for the Netherportal to work easy. Maybe the Nether is so hot not because it's basically hell and there is lava, maybe there was stone but the Netherstone's potential energy cannot be contained in its physical form thus it radiates the massive excess energy resulting in the air being so extremely hot. How Steve/Alex can survive this with no problem despite having a big problem with normal fire or lava is beyond me.

Secondly, Minecraft has access to magic. Or rather it's an actual concept in the world. Magic often being a source of immense energy could also be the thing that fuels the portal. Weirdly enough, the portal has to be set up in a certain formation, making it possible for the whole thing to just be a ritual to set free magical power.
I don‚Äôt think Minecraft‚Äôs physics works the same as real life what with the whole: ‚Äúblocks float in mid air‚Äù, ‚Äúwater flows infinitely‚Äù and ‚Äúyou can carry the weight of the Eiffel Tower in your pocket‚Äù that Minecraft has going on
Or even better, the Overworld is a freaking Matrioshka  world with a balk hole on his center in order to produce gravity. And so the Nether is very close to the center which is why space-time is completely changed. This would also explain the fact that the Sun and the Moon orbits around the over world as MatPat proves it., and why the Overworld has a surface area far bigger than Earth's.
Just watch SFIA if you don't know what I'm talking about.
I saw this video and yelled
‚ÄúoOoo0oh HECK‚Äù
Or maybe everything is just 8 times bigger in the regular world
lame
"LIQUID HOT MAGMA!"
           -Austin 2019
Or mabye the Nether is just 8x bigger than the overworld and a side effect that the portal has is that it also grows the player 8x the size?

Have you thought of the fact that the minecraft world is round and the nether is underground? This would explain the distancing, if the nether portal takes you straight downwards at least.
I always just assumed the nether was in the mantle and the reason you would go more distance is due to you going aroung the planet on a shorter curve because youre deeper, but I mean, this works too
Nether is not a planet as there's no above ground and the distance is easily explained by actually being near the core hence extrapolating the change in altitude magnified.

This is overcomplicated.
Reeeee some of this was filmed in Bedrock Edition
Sorry matpat but at the first 10 secs Austin's already 50√ó funnier
And doesn't stop to make useless puns
...But then what happens to the moon? Is it the first casualty?
you lost me...a lot
What if the nether is just in another galaxy
When u fall completely out of the map it is a black void which could be.... A black void
The nether could just be 8 time smaller and there for when a portal is made  in the nether it move 8 space.
I'm pretty sure most of us don't know what a Stargate is. I am one of the few that do know. I'm almost 19 so I really shouldn't know.
Hay Austin I think your formula in 12:45 is wrong I think. If anyone can cleeify it plz do.
I'm sorry if someone pointed this out already, but there is something fundamentally wrong with your calculation of the energy at 12:30. 

You write have written
E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + pc^2
and then taken the square root as
E = mc^2 + sqrt(p) c
which is wrong. You would get
E = sqrt((mc^2)^2 + pc^2)

Nevertheless I dont think that this will change the magnitude of your resulting energy that much.
I think most of us agree that the nether is not in the same solar system. It's definitely in another dimension that's for sure.

It's either inside the MC world as the biome name is hell or another dimension as that is what it is referred to and more plausible because if you break  the neater roof there is no sun there.  I think it's both or least in another dimension. 
It makes sense if it is both if it in a different plane of existence but occupying the space of the overworlds core. but not sure if it will be the same size or smaller as I don't know the terrain generation limits for each of the even is. as these calculations are assuming that they both have a set size to them. 

It will be cool if you take these theories into account and see what comes of it as I don't know the limits myself, if it is in another plane then our law may not even apply to it except that the gravity is the same but is it due to them being the same size or that the gravity laws are different making it smaller but coincidentally giving it the same gravity
What if the Mincraft world is infinitely round and the nether has the radius of world radius/8, which would still be infinity, but it's infinity/8
Austin: Starts video with profanity 

Me: Sits in comfortably
Rip, I watched the villager section two seconds after I logged out of minecraft with the villager pillager update.
Ummm, the whole 8 block thing is because the nether is underground (not a planet).


Does this mean I win Game Theory? I think it does.
9:35
are you saying Minecraft has a....
Black Hole Sun?
I got a theory to calm down Austin, your controlling the world around you in alternate universes like that one mat pat video were you control your own world. You through the portal the connection to all the other infinite universes, and take another portal to another universe that is controlled by space time. Wait that would mean that space time controls the quantum thing!!
ok sooooooooooo. its nine in the morning I have work in an hour sooooooooo I don't really wanna think about anything more complicated that 2+2 XDDDDD anyway I actually followed everything except the math part because I didn't want to think about that, well I got the mph/m/s and radius and stuff as I was hearing these I was understanding. did you dumb it down near the end bc I think either im waking up more or you dummed it down as I was typing lol
here is the alternative theory, the Minecraft world is spherical and beneath the bedrock lies the nether which is a much smaller radius and therefore the nether portals only transport up down.
If 2 people are on a server and one enters the nether for 10 mins and leaves, the same time has gone by, so is it true time also stretches by 8?
Austin: literally everything about your videos makes me nerd- giggle. Keep it up. I wish to continue to be GOD. DAYUM. TERRIFIED.
the nether
is a dimension 

the nether
is NOT a planet
Game theory has officially somehow fallen further from grace than they already did.
Cool, but you're forgetting that the Nether is a dimension, and it seems to be inside some cave since it has walls, a ceiling, and a floor, and even though it is called a dimension, the 'Earth' is named 'The Overworld'. So there's a possibility that the nether takes place deep underground.

If you dig far down enough you'll reach bedrock, but if you somehow break that bedrock, you'll just fall straight into a void. In the nether, if you dig far up enough, you'll reach bedrock but if you somehow break that bedrock, you'll be standing in the void and walking around over(under?) the nether.
you forgot that every time it reaches a certain day it resets time
I always thought the nether was under the overworks though...
There's a "sincerely austin" But he never started the email
wait if the portal is always open wouldnt the nether itself eventually get pulled through the portal and collapse with the world
I know, the nether is just hell. That's it
Wong it‚Äôs not true nether is not a plant
I guess Steve didn't feel so good....
But what if the nether is normal and earth is the other 2nd world
IT'S JUST A GAAAAAAME
Uhh but the nether isn't another planet... It's called a dimension in the game files and is commonly known as below bedrock of the overworld (hence the name overworld). If it's a layer lower then there's less distance to travel to move out because it's a smaller sphere to walk around
Forgot the time of day and night in Minecraft
185 comments in 6 seconds
Youtube where are they. youtube your drunk go home.
2b2t anyone?
Austin: Minecraft is dying because nether portal


Me: **MAKE AN EVEN BIGGER PORTAL**
so, here's the thing, I'm going to explain it like planets, ignoring the fact that everything is a cube, so, the nether has walls ceeling and a floor, so this video doesnt work anymore, the nether is basically the core of the planet 8 times smaller than the planet itself, this would explain how its burning hot, now, lets say you are at 0,0 cords right? you move to the other side of the "planet" imagine it would be 0,8000 lets say, since the nether is the core of the planet, and 8 times smaller, the "other side" of the nether would be 0,1000, the position you are in the planet, translates directly to the position you would be in the nether, if that sphere was 8 times smaller, being the core of the planet, now the end, is in the middle of both, if you managed to survive falling to the void in the over world, you would hit the end, and if you managed to survive the void in the end, you would hit the bedrock in the nether's ceiling, and after nether is the very very middle of the planet.
also 1 second translating to 8 seconds in the nether would be impossible because multiplayer servers.
It's a different dimension, and therefore follows different laws of physics. Also different dimensions of space. I think. I'm no Einstein.
Or, ya know, another dimension
Austin: Minecraft is screwed, and it‚Äôs not for the reason you‚Äôre thinking.

Me: So it‚Äôs not because of problems with relativistic speed, black holes, or the extreme levels of energy required to keep a portal open?

Austin: 
What if the nether was just moving really slow? This is assuming that the Nether is a planet moving at a regular speed but if it was slowing down instead of Earth speeding up, would that change anything?
I just learned that 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the real world
Now I know why those faction servers have so many nether portals everywhere
You know what's truly terrifying? That 8 chevron stargate he showed.
Help, y'all are too smart for me
or maybe the nether is closer to the center of the planet so the distances are shorter in the nether
Minecraft the endgame?
Round earthers,
Flat earthers,
Now what!?


Cube earthers?
I might have missed the part where you explain why distance in one world being eight times the distance in another is equivalent to one world's time being eight times as fast as the other, but it makes some intuitive sense, so I'll accept it.
What I won't accept is all of the other assumptions you're making, e.g. that the Nether is another planet (it's explicitly referred to in the game as another "dimension," even though I hate how that word gets used in these contexts because it doesn't mean that at all), how the universe itself operates on the same laws of physics as ours and has the same physical constants, and so on. It doesn't work.
I am pretty disappointed in this episode. Some of the formulae you showed are complete rubbish, and did you basically imply that it is possible to escape a black hole after passing the event horizon, given enough energy?
oh F**k, I made a world out of TNT so the world will EXPLODE
You kind of went off topic with this one. First off, the original thing  was that you travel 8 times the DISTANCE. And for some reason, you changed that to time. I don't think time is affected when you're in the nether. Second, you went right to the conclusion that in order 8 blocks to equal 1 block in the nether, you would have to bend space and time. I think the reason you assumed this was because you also assumed that the nether was an entire separate world. I think the easiest answer to this is the nether is just under the minecraft world. Below the bedrock. And there's evidence for this too. If you try to go high enough in the nether, you hit a ceiling a bedrock. A while ago, MatPat did a game theory that says that the minecraft world was round. So if the nether is under the minecraft world, then the radius of the nether would be smaller than the overworld hence the walking one block in the nether equals walking 8 blocks in the overworld.

Sorry for the long rant lolüòä
Film theory: How does Carl's house fly in Up?
What if the shorter distance it could be because the Neather is the Overworld's underground and so there is  less surface area for the Nether and if you went down walked a bit and went  straight up you'd travel further relative to the surface and the portals are an easy way to travel between the surface and Nether. Of course that only works if we assume the Minecraft world was a sphere like planet.

More likely explanation  and easier to explain, the Nether is just a parrallel demension to the Minecraft world with different laws of nature.
Sigh. I am sad. Like if you have been playing minecraft since DanTDM did the mods?
Dear Austin, hi it‚Äôs me your worst nightmare!
Pease Read the following in a German accent:

you can't live without it... literally. you can't. it's impossible.
Minecraft over world= earth.
Nether= core of earth
Oh no
The Game Theorists  Has come to the dark side of Games
Nether: Is another dimension
Austin: commits die
This man had to work at hella hard to make this video you better like and subscribe
ai more minecraft
The Minecraft world infinite though
Notch.... I Don't Feel Too Good...
It‚Äôs space the final frontier
Austin needs a hug again : )
No because it higher because the higher u go the faster time is for u and if the nether is faster its higher or less the world is under the nether... Sub to me XD
time is just an illusion
Nice video and learned a lot about relativity. But you're wrong my friend. We know that this hypothesis is wrong by using the in-game achievements for going into the nether "must dig deeper". This tells us that it is not another planet, world, or dimension, but simply a location beneath the bedrock of the overworld that you are on. We also know that the Minecraft overworld would technically have to be round since gravity is the same no matter where you go inside the overworld. Since the overworld is round then the underworld or nether would also be round. Because it's round walking one block in the nether is equal to walking eight blocks in the overworld since the overworld is over the nether. The reason you would need a portal to travel between the two places isn't that you travel to another planet, but because you can't get past the bedrock. Unless you hack the game, going above or below the bedrock is not intended and in some cases can crash the game (building on top of the nether).
But what about the theory of the Dead Sun?
ay yo bruv what if minecraft is a sphere and the nether is just closer to the center of the planet (you can go around a 100m track 8x faster than you can go around an 800m track)
Dear Austin,

     Realize that there doesn‚Äôt need to warping for 8 over world blocks to fit to a single nether block. Think of the nether as a tennis ball and overworked as a exercise ball. To go from the top to the bottom of the tennis ball on the surface you travel less distance than the exercise ball top to bottom on the surface. How ever big the Minecraft world is the nether is likely an 1/8th the size sphere inside  and nether portals transfer you up and down between layers.And given how the Earth‚Äôs core rotates faster than the surface this could also explain time warping as day/night cycle speeding up due to spinning at a different speed relative to the sun and the surface
Or you know.... It's just magic and there is no way to actually explain it because the nether is literal hell that is faster than our earth or vice versa
But screw it lets ruin minecraft
I think your overlooking the fact they are cubes


Good video tho
In English please
15:14 - Dethklok? I love that band! :D

I also love the Death Clock, an invention by Professor Hubert Farnsworth. :)
I really think the editors of this channel don't get enough credit. Some of the best editing I have ever seen has been on this channel. Keep up the excellent work!
Matpat: fnaf done, now on to bendy!
March 2019, new fnaf game
Mat pat: oh crap, NOOOOOOO
is every game franchise (i cant spell) has bet that who can break matpat first


I bEt oN sCOtT
So is this gonna be a new thing? With matpat being there instead of a voice over? Well, in the end i enjoyed itüòä dont come at me.
MatPat: YES! BENDY AND FNAF ARE OVER!
litterly Scott and TheMeatly:*teasers*
MatPat: NO GOD! NO GOD PLEASE NO, NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
MatPat: Finally the franchise is over 

Every franchise creator: hold my beer
There is something called a paraquel, I believe it was only invented by one of my favourite authors, FE Higgins but I could be wrong. It is when the story doesn‚Äôt take place before or after the original, but rather at the same time, events in one story often being linked or the cause of events in the other. Just a thought.
Y'know when Bijuu Mike is here,
That's a huge accomplishment for him.
matpat has reached the point of no return, he has left the recording closet.
Do a Fran bow theory. Please. FRAN BOW THEORY.
Scott and Mike: * Makes new games *
Matpat: Am I a joke to you?
"your heads a bigger target"

"OHH I'LL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET"
Scott: I'm about to end this man's career
The Meatly: So am I
Ava Max: SO AM I SO AM I SO AM I I I I I
Bendy (in chapter 5): AAHHH THE END!! I DONT FEEL SO GOOD...!!!!


       
1 year later....



Bendy: IM BACK B***S!!!





Henry: here we go again.....





Also sub 2 pewdiepie
MatPat:Finnaly Finished all the Batim Theorys

Joey drew:"Released Bendy and the dark Revival"

MatPat:OH COME ON
Fnaf comes back

Matpat: cries in the closet

bendy comes back

Matpat: SCREAMS IN CLOSET
Oh boy! Timelines! it's Undertale all over again!






...not sure if that's good or bad.
Matpat: when does this end creators?
Creators: yes.
Mat pat: your supposed to throw it in my hand! 
Chris: your head is a bigger target. 
Me: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Like for Mat pat
‚ÄúI‚ÄôL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET!‚Äù
Hey, matpat I think you should calm down ü§£
Scott: I hAvE a NeW gAmE cOmInG oUt!
The Meatly: oh yeah? So do I!
Matpat: ....*send help*
Bijuu Mike was shooketh when he found out he was in the video
The truth confirmed: matpat os joey drew and the buthcer gang are his slaves of scott cawthon, the meatly, and the petscop man
Game theory head quarters: THE SERIES IS OVER!!

Drunk Series creator: now let me stap ya righ der friends
if this mystery man is really just Sammy Lawrence again.......
Anyone miss when we had flat pat instead of him actually being there
Yay five nights at Bendy‚Äôs. 



Wait you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs not that...

Ok
I think I know who this knew character is, it's Bendy, not Demon Bendy, just....Bendy. If we look at 1 of the little Bendy shorts we will notice at the end of the 1 with Bendy in a graveyard we see a silhouette of a realistic Human man, which everyone obviously thinks that it's Joey calling bendy out of the cartoon and being put into his real life Demon form, or something along those lines, but what if that's not the case. If you remember, whenever Bendy gets near Henty he starts chasing after him, but he never chases after anyone else unless they're chasing Henry as well, such as the Projectionist in Chapter 4 and the Butcher Gang in chapter 5(the last 1 only happening if you go into 1 of the hiding places while the Butcher Gang are chasing you and Bendy comes out at the same time) but if Bendy is after Henry, why does he save him? Well I think that the 1 who showed their silhouette in the graveyard short, was actually Henry. It was Henry, looking at what Bendy had become, on the screen, and his shadow was cast onto the world of Bendy's show most likely because Henry might've been directly in front of the light of the projector. But anyways, that shadow of Henry, for all we know, that could've been the last Bendy short made, the last 1 made before Bendy got called out of the Ink Machine and turned into Demon Bendy. After all that, Bendy woke up and saw the horrible creature he had become and tried to remember what happened before that, and he immediately remembered Henry. Henry was his creator, but instead of being made into a loveable cartoon like Henry wanted, he got turned into a monstrous creature, a true Demon, and he blamed Henry for that. He did this because if he never showed his drawings of Bendy to Joey, he would've never gotten to the point where he was a true Demon, and that's why he chases Henry. He does this because he's angry at Henry eventually making him the way he is, but Henry is still Bendy's creator, which is why he hurts others who try to hurt him, he believes the only way to teach Henry a lesson is to make sure he gets destroyed by something that is truly his creation, the only example being Bendy. But how does this tie into some sort of good Bendy, because both theories start out the same way, the Human shadow cast onto Bendy. You ever heard how there cannot be good without evil, or in this case there can't be a Devil without an Angel? Well the same thing applies here. If there was a Demon Bendy, that means traits of his Demon side got injected into this form, but that means that somewhere else, his mischievous, loveable, carefree side is still out there. I think, someone might've made another Bendy behind Joey's back, thinking if they did that, then he would end the making of these living creations, but instead something happened that turned them into the other Bendy, and the mischievous, loveable, and carefree pieces o Bendy got injected into him, as well as his own Bendy form. In the Dark Revival, that title might simply mean because it was a new Bendy, everyone thought it was the creation of another demon, or the other Bendy REVIVING himself into a more perfect form. And these notes about Henry feeling someone watching him, that's the good Bendy following him to make sure Henry is safe. If this doesn't make sense to you, sorry, but I'm not explaining it any further
Matpat: Quaking And shaking
Editors: Over 9000
Me: Wanting water


Dunno what you expected. ∆™(Àò‚å£Àò) É
when i saw the scatter plots i legit nearly cried, SCATTER PLOTS ARE THE BANE OF MY VERY MORTAL EXISTENCE
Fnaf: New Game!
Bendy: New Game!
Mat: Cries
Earthbound series: Creator says he will never make another earthbound
Mat: 
What if it‚Äôs a multiplayer where some people will be bendy, Boris, etc...
‚ÄúYour head‚Äôs a bigger target...‚Äù


Get recked my guy
Another bendy game?
Should I be excited? (Cuz... more theories...)
Or not excited? (Cuz... less theories...)
Chapter 5 was a prequel its gonna show wut happened after chapter 4 I think...
Not a Prequel?
Not a Sequel?
I think its a Battle Royale...
What if the butcher gang represent  hear no evil, speak no evil, and see no evil.
i would've made a meme using this intro but idk how to :/
.......does he know about the new BATIM books?
If he doesn‚Äôt I feel bad for himüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Basic a telltale game but with bendy and ACTULY contoling your character
MatPat: Make me disappear in to ink, editors!

Editors: ok

 
You should have called it bendy and the dark reveal
The editing was noticeably amazing on this video guys, great work. I can't wait to find out what this new game is about!
(Sorry if I did mistake on rewind ;-;")I just really have a lot of things to ask ;w;
Mat: The beginning your supposed to throw it at my hand 

Friend of Mat: your heads a bigger target

Mat: I‚Äôll show you a bigger target
Scott cawthon: brings back fnaf

Matpat: sob

The meatly: 

Matpat: 
Matpat:dismembered and put back together 
My mind:MANGLE
Matpat: I wanna disappear into a puddle of ink! Make it happen editors!
Editors: OKAY! proceeds to edit him into a trash can
5:25 
MatPat: Why? WHY? WHY?!?!
Scott: cue evil laughter
‚ÄúThat my friends, is the question for today‚Äù
Matpat, 8:08 minutes in
>:(
Matpat:Finally finished the fnaf time to relax

Bendy:im about to end this man‚Äôs whole carrer
its demons, angels and something else
DOGS (borris)
Verse 4:14 from anywhere literally can be applied. Maybe it's also a hint?
What if whoever is watching Henry is the one leaving the secret messages?
in my thoughts this is like infamous you have a meter on what your actions cause more good actions the better more bad actions the badder
Guess who‚Äôs back?

Back again.

Bendy‚Äôs back.

Tell a friend.
Matpat: There's a lot of stuff to unpack here
Youtube: shows DPD advertisment
"Oh I will show you a bigger target" wonder what happened after this XD
Wait so your telling me THAT A NEW BENDY GAME IS COMING WHEN I'M HAVE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO GET THE FIRST ONE ( screams like fnaf) NOOOOOO!!!!
Me:(at best part)weeeeeee!!!!!(add shows up)Me:üòîüî´
Bendy: **New Game**
FNaF: **New Game**
Petscop: **New Gameplay Videos**
MatPat: **Loses Whatever Remains of His Sanity**
return to me, or your soul is gone.
Matpat: Nobody can say shooketh better them me!
Alex Beckham: Hold my beer
Sammy Lawrence is alive
Matt: CANDLES.
Now it‚Äôs time for Project Libitina to come out and for Dan Salvato to drive Mattpatt crazy again
MatPat getting things thrown at him for an intro just made my day üòÇ
MR winch hook fellah from butcher gang has a sign that says liar
Scott will be the end of MatPat. FNAF INVADED A THEORY THAT DOESNT BELONG TO IT! (FNAF needs to learn some boundaries)
Or maybe you are ment to multiply 414√ó414 because of the second 414
MatPat: *Literally makes a hole story about the game *

Game creators: Not today sis *Makes a new game *

MatPat: Am I a joke to you?
-Good comedy
-Good points 
-Credits and admits he isnt the one to find certain parts
now this is the game theory I love
In The Thumbnail It Looks Like Alice Is Turning To Dust. I don‚Äôt feel so good
Fnaf in a bendy video?
THE HORROR COLLIDES
"Your heads a bigger target" 
Me: dang
"Imma show you a bigger target"
Me: N O I C E
0:23 thats what u get "guy that hit matpat with a plunger"!, MATPAT DA BEST!
FNAF, Petscop, Bendy have entered the chat
i like how jacsepticeyes says o i get to finally fight you?
and then everyone else is like o shoot he is back i thought he was ded
If you compare Sammy's voice recordings and this new mystery character's voice recordings from the trailer; You can see that they both sound rather SIMILAR. My theory is that Sammy has come back again to reawaken the darkened world of Joey Dew Studios. Hence why Sammy has his ritual candles around that inky pipe. He is trying to summon, or in this case, awaken a specific entity that has probably haunted the Joey Drew Studios BEFORE.
The end of bendy and the ink machine felt empty to me like too empty which was a disappointment to me so all I was thinking was it can't be over because what exactly did you accomplish
Well I hope you play it I think you would enjoy because I think ( not sure) that you liked fnaf?
FNAF, Bendy, Petscop, Deltarune, and VR Accounting Plus have entered the chat


MatPat has left the chat
oh I will show you a bigger target
to be continued meme
Samy is a life in chapter 3.
There a secret in chapter 3
Buy it says RETURN to the studio, so they really messed up
._. 
You know how At the end of the game Joey say to go through the door that make u go through the game again
And you go through the loop for the 414th time
But what happen if you don‚Äôt go through the door
Henry knows he going to go through this again and again so why don‚Äôt he avoid it

But I understand he going through the loop and something gonna disrupt the loop but just sayin y don‚Äôt he avoid the door Joey told him to go probably nothing would happen

What do you guys think?
I love how Matpat always makes a final video and it really rounds things up. 

And then the devs are just like "haha, lol. Nah"
Game will play out based on choices

...






SOUNDS LIKE UNDERTALE
0:06 Throws thor hammer
CATCH......
*runs*hahaha YEEET
Susie is the only dark to bendy and Henry. If it was before  Sammy was killed than it can‚Äôt be a side story
DANM MatPat has gotten a lot better at editing his videos not that he was bad before but yeah
Literally every other youtuber : "omg!! sammy lawrence?! are you kidding me!!"
Jacksepticeye : "do i have to finally fight you?"
Guys, go to 6:49 and slow down to x0.25 speed.


You'll see something appear to the top right of mat in the doorway
They‚Äôre trying to see who can make matpat go insane first
Your heads a bigger target.... OH ILL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGETüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is this a new era for game theory?
GreenScreen Era?






ok im not complaining.
Bendy:did anyone miss me?

Matpat:*screams in hidden code*
So... Herny is stuck on a loop making every thing completely pointless huh?



THANKS FOR BUYING OUR GAMES!
Mat: you‚Äôre supposed to throw it at my HAND! 
Chris(offscreen): your head‚Äôs a bigger target 
Mat: Oh I will show you a ‚Äùbigger target‚Äù
Me: I feel like this was unscripted üòã
I think Bendy killed the projectionist because that would be a big enough change to alter the story line if the projectionist really caught you
When you popped up behind the door I screamed
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to throw it in my hand!‚Äù
‚ÄúYour head‚Äôs a bigger target‚Äù
‚ÄùOh I‚Äôll show you a bigger target‚Äù
Probably a coincidence, but Abraham Lincoln died April 14, 414
I like these new types of videos. They are well edited (props to the editors) as well as interesting. 


I love them all.
Ascor FNAF has something special like you Taylor dayne
Alice:the choices you make
Me: DELTARUNE
Matpat: Finally, the franchise is over!
New Bendy Game : Well yes, but actually no.
Also Sammy melt after Tom/Thomas Connor killed him.
Anyone remember the door we couldn't reach that had the secret message "exit?" Written on it? I think it's got something to do with  dark revivals. I mean, just look at the evidence. The stairwell it's in is full of chains for like in the trailer and it is the right shape for lowering down the ink machine. It could be the where the ink machine is lowered to in the trailer (the lowest part of the stairs is opposite the door....)
The "Unknown" sounds like Kollector from MK11.
So um I‚Äôve watched this before
Is wearing headphones 
Ears are dying at intro
At 2:00 MatPat is saying that gamers were surprised to fight Sammy

Jack is just annoyed at having to fight him.
#TeamBendy
Everyone loves th ink demon, so why not pick his side?
A poor mans "Epic Mickey"

Spring-trap: I always come back
All the other games: same!
Spring-trap: u bi-
Bendy and the in... milk machine
What if it‚Äôs Wally Franks that watches him?!
You see Sammy at one other time between his " death" and ch. 5, in the sewers in ch.3! You don't see him directly, but you can clearly see his shadow on a wall in the pipe system
Hey Matt petscop has uploaded 4 videos today, might want to look into that.
Now five, watch as I edit this and six comes out...
im really enjoying this new format of the videos.
What happened to the guy you bested up with the plunger XD
me: seeing start*
me: nope!!!
OH ILL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET
Not a prequel, not a sequel...

It's an equal.

My name for a different side of the story taking place at the same time.
5:29 is it just me or did he just glitch
Also at 6:50 in the doorway

Psst, MatPat. Petscop uploaded again (4 times) I need my Petscop theories!
There is a guy coping you I think
But I would like you to check his channel, even the editing , voice, intro are the same

Notice me
OH GOD
GOD NO, NO, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I've always wanted a Bendy 2. It's such a great game and it would be amazing if Bendy was back
Absolutely phenomenal editing in this video! Keep up the good work editors you've really outdone yourselves! Pat on the backüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Roses are red,
New games are coming non-stop,

guys that other dude sounds like G-man... HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED!!!!
Here's the summary:

Joey was so horrible that everyone died. The End
MP I'm begging  you go back to the old style. You're a cute guy and everything but these just don't feel like game theory with you onscreen. Then again, here I am. Guess I'm just not used to it yet.
everyone that's stiill hybernating:


the meatly: BATIM 2 IS COMING SOON


me: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?!?!?
more, more, I NEED MORE!.
I loved this so much!~

Ok, let's be honest.
 FNAF is haunting MatPat.
Yassss!! Bijuu mike!!!
"oh i will show you a bigger target"


 ?????????
Been a month eh?

OK, so if it's not prequel, not sequel and even not batim2, then is a DLC!

I know everyone got this.
Oh i will show you a bigger target
Do binding of isaac AFTERBIRTH+ IT HAS MORE STORY LINES!

I feel like them getting out from DEFY and gaining that independence has allowed them to create better content that they have wanted to create for awhile. The new delivery style and editing is great. I love that they still keep touches of what we're used to (memes and cartoony style) while evolving into this greenscreened matpat instead of meme-face matpat.
I watched this in my game theory socks! You weren't lieing about how soft they are. I LOOVE THEMMMM!!!!!
Dang, I guess this is some sort of Bendy boi: Civil war type stuff
I got some JSAB vibe on the thumbnail
New FNAF Game
New Bendy Game
Good luck MatPat
Matpat I have exahausted every option I have. I need you to figure out how Seattle is the source of all the power in life is strange ..... I can not possibly do this alone the world needs you mat Pat , I need you .
MIKE. ARE YOU THERE? 
(Yes. I came from Mike, yes. I only watch fnaf on here :3 )
"Accounting Part 3 when?"
- Crows Crows Crows
This isnt connected to the video:

"You were supposed to throw it at my hand."

What is bendy fans played the whole bendy series 414 times üòÇ
And what if u got an achievement called re living the past
when they ar talking about dark reveal 
but you dont even played BATIM:


some random black & white picture
Is the Meatly Scott Cawthon?

At this point I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was.
(Takes deep breath)

I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
MatPat: *makes horror game theory*

Me: *cries silently and clicks on video*
"I'll show you a BIGGER TARGET."
8 minute long intro....CoNgRaTuLaTiOnS!
MRS KESHA CAME BACK
I found new characters recordings in chap 2 on mobile bendy
Bendy 2: electric inkgaloo
I wish this came out sooner...
I really want to play it.
thank you for theories!
16:21 OH No DA BUCHER GANG HaS LEARNED HOW TO CLONE






Edit just kidding
*Starts theory 8 minutes in*
Love this new format. Feels so much more personal.
I like the new format, but a small part of me kinda misses the old ways. But I'm really glad you're trying new things Mat. May your show go on for many years to come!
Plz do a theory on why main characters don't talk in there game
When green screens let you down.
Ow that hurt
This styles growing on me...
When Scott releases teasers


Matpat cries in the fourth closet.
Fnaf gets a new game: üòØ


Bendy gets a new game: üòÆ


Petscop drops 5 new videos in a row: ü§Ø
You have been shookith from this game theory
the butcher gang have been bad the fisher lied and the piper must have stole something of value an arm and a leg are missing. and the middle one he tried to talk maybe he didn't like what was going on at the studies and tried to expose them using human souls isn't exactly ethical. love you matpat keep up the work
If you could do a video on Stray Cat Crossing and what exactly is the whole story, I would LOVE IT!
Comment which side you'll choose 
#TeamBendy or #TeamAlice.
bring the old style back! :(
Who else got the ink drop distance thing?

Y‚Äôknow cuz kh dream drop distance...

I‚Äôm leaving now
Mat when you said shooketh, i was like "Hey i say that"
Dawko was acknowledged by Game Theory? MIND BLOWN
What if as a joke the game doesn't change and it's literally just the same game because the loop never changed üòÇ

Edit: 447 LIKES?! THIS COMMENT SHOULDN'T BE GETTING THIS MANY LIKES BUT THANK YOU?
Yooooo at 6:49 the shadow from the door!?!? That‚Äôs attention to detail if I‚Äôve ever seen it. Great job y‚Äôall üëèüëèüëè
Props for the editing...good job
I‚Äôm finally finished with fnaf!

Fnaf: NOPE

Then... I‚Äôm finally finished with Bendy and the ink machine!

BATIM: NOPE
That graph of data of statistics is called a scatter diagram.
Go Maths
Other youtubers:Le shooketh
JACK:Do I Finally have to fight you?
Petscop is back.... 5 more videos uploaded to the petscop channel.
Yesssss the intro üòπ
Well that person that was talking 


Maybe just maybe might be 
Sammy Lawrence 

Or Norman Polk 
Sammy always was watching Henry in chapter 1

And on level  14 when you meet the projectionist (AKA Norman Polk)
All you have to do is listens to the tape 
On the box 
He said he was always watching
wait so then is the dark revival a continuation of the original game, like stopping a story then coming back to it a long time after. Not in a sequel kind of way though.
not a sequel?
not a prequal?
and could be a in a different universe?
ITS A SIDEQUAL!
Bendy 2 gonna release soon

Matpat: ah man, here we go again
...

Like if you agree
Or maybe you are the ink maschine!!! The lost soul (the player), without the maschine can only produce the unconsciousness, the ink.
scott and mike are probably plotting a crossover to mess with pat-








i'd like to see that
Soooo fnaf is back... and now we got bendy... we gonna get slender next?
Hey I think you should listen to Build up Our Machine it‚Äôs really good I love your videos:)
Spoilers: In the new book "Dreams come to life" the main character is named Buddy (a 17-year old delivery boy) who teams up with Dot (another new character who is a writing intern). I believe it happens after Henry leaves the studio in 1930. Notice how Henry calls Boris (Chapter 3 Boris) Buddy in chapter 3 even in invisible ink.
BENevolent  DEmon,  sounds like Bendi's full name
is this game theory or math class
MatPat: finishes off Batim
TheMeatly: creates Batdr
MatPat: ...
MatPat: more theories :‚Äô)
nobody: "you should add more one liners and take a long time to start the episode"

matpat: takes 8 min to get to the actual question of the episode
Lol i just got done with my science fair project
Confirmed MatPat beats his colleagues XD jk love ya MatPat
Matpat: I wish I could have a attack plunger right now
His friend: throws the plunger at his head
Matpat: u were supposed to throw it at my hand
His friend: but ur head is a bigger target 
Matpat: oh I will show u a bigger target
Very nice intro I could say xD
Bendy fandom: The Meatly left so many questions and didn‚Äôt tell the story as well as he could!!!

The Meatly: ‚ÄúHold my Bacon Soup‚Äù
MatPat:That's the first box of BATIM now for the 100 boxes left.
It's maybe his DAD
4=D
1=A
4=D
414=DAD
It's bendy dad/Creater 
It's my theory...
Its duolingo bird that always watches henry so obvious
A really cool theory that you could do os Detroit Become Human, who is RA9? It's something to look into!
Mats new format made him come out of the "recording closet"
* Matt Patt casually whacks his friend with a plunger*
‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll show you a bigger target‚Äù -MatPat 2019
Gotta remove that tumor from his back üòùüò∞
10:35 sounds like prime Starscream
‚ÄúI‚ÄôLL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET!‚Äù ü§£ I lost it.
What if the game just becomes an FPS shooter game
Thumbs up for the intro alone. XD
FNAF is awesome because of the gameplay,the graphics,the music,the characters,AND THE LORE!!!!
414...
we were so close to greatness
we were this close

for you non memers out there i mean 420 of course
Scott Cawthon: I have the most complicated Horror Game Story in the entire World. 

TheMeatly Games: Hold my goddamn beer.
MatPat: Maybe we will find out who that tommy gun belonged to...
Me: me gimme
what if the butcher gang was made by a version of Sammy trying to be like bendy and create ink life but failed and they are the souls of people who defied bendy of he just didn't like them hence the  'liar" (im just spewing stuff, dont mind me)
ahh so the badguy is either picasso or aftons grandfather
narrows it a bit
The long white candles are also found by the Wandering Is A Terrible Sin cutouts in both chapters 2 and 4. Both of these cutouts are surrounded by Bendy heads in chapter 2 and by dismembered Boris and Alice dolls and a sobbing lost one in chapter 4 that makes it  look more like some sort of ritual shrine that probably Sammy made because of the candles and in which chapters they were placed. In chapter 2 Sammy was introduced, and in chapter 4 Sammy got resurrected. Theorize this and fans will be pleased.
MatPat will be happy:
FNAF vr and Bendy 2...
Petscop is uploading strongly
Let's have more gt intros like this because that was hilarious
what about a girl version of bendy but good and perfect
What if the game comes out in 414 days
FNAF and then BENDY and then PETSCOP!!!!
matpat has left the chat
About time MatPat did a face reveal üòÖ
is Minecraft Nether and The End a Planet?..... 




plez answer :3
The Legend of Zelda,
Except,
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
Link is replaced by Alice Angel. (The good one with the sword, The replacement for the Master Sword.)
Imagine if the unknown character is called Matthew Patterson. YOU KNOW WHO HE‚ÄôS BASED ON
Only MatPat can make a theory revolving around candles.
4:30 the drum gun is back bois
Dude, you never asked the question of, who did Henry become when Joey used him on the ink machine, there are clues to who he is, like how Sammy says that he gave you everything, when he gave it to bendy, so what if he confused you for bendy, BECAUSE HENRY IS BENDY TOO! Think about this dude, why else would he then attack you if he‚Äôs mad at bendy?
So my friend at school said to me, "Do you like conspiracy theories?" and I said, "No, I like game theories.". I dunno if they're the same thing or not.
"I will show you a bigger target" - Matpat 2019
This and more FNaF stuff.
I am preparing MatPat's funeral arrangements.
‚ÄúGamers across YouTube were shooketh.‚Äù
MatPat: you're supposed to throw into my ‚úã 
Chris: you're heads a bigger target
MatPat:I'll show you a bigger target. 
Smash Bros announcer: 3    2     1    GOOO!!
Am choosing bendy
That's why bendy on Twitter has this weird choose between coffee or tea/horror or mystery/etc. Ask thing with Alice and Bendys face for each side ! We're going to choose a path fellas!!
MatPat: You were supposed to throw it at my hand!
Chris: Your head is a bigger target
Oh iLl sHoW YoU A BiGgEr tArGeT-
8:07. So this will be Bendy's Deltarune?
I‚Äôm not a fan of the new editing tbh I just don‚Äôt feel it it‚Äôs too much sorry Matpat I still love your channel so I‚Äôll deal with it but it‚Äôs just not my style I guessü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I loved that intro more then I should of üíÄ only GT
Btw TEAM BENDY üòà
This was the moment MatPat knew-

He was going crazy
12:28
If it was that bendy i whould really be scared
0:25
I love how no one's talking about the weird noise this guy makes
Matpat: i'll shoW YOu A BiGgER TARGET
wait, (great theory here, im just checking) i though that if you take the demon route in chapter 3 Bendy finds you more often as you r doing the tasks for Alice?
I know having a green screen is supposed to be a improvement to having a unmoving cut out of yourself but that was part of the charm of these videos


Edit: It just feels so much genuine as in it was not a actor put corporatively in front of a green screen but rather just a man making videos in photo shop who was as common as the rest of us. It just ironically felt that it was the real Matpat who was talking to us, not some heartless suit like the competition meant to replicate human feels in the cold husk of flesh, or maybe I just do not like Change which could also be a possibility
The Butcher gang member with the word 'Liar' on them

the 'Liar' part kinda looks like  41AR  AR could mean Apr for April so 414 again







but its probably a stretch
You don't have to do a game theory on brutal legends
Matpat petscop just uploaded over 3 videos!!! We need you :( :0
0:99 that eyeroll üòÇ
Thumbnail: erases ink with an eraser




Wait that's illegal
8:10 is when he finally says that is the question for today
Me: so I had sit through all this boring stuff for 8 minutes and then we finally get to the fun stuff
Who else dances the wEiRdEsT dance when the intro comes on?





just me? oki... ;-;
Do a theory on Days Gone and also when the game comes out can you play it on GTL. If you do I would really like that.üëåüèªüòéüëåüèªüëçüèªü§òüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

"Oh, I'll show you a bigger target" Lmao My new favorite moment
Guys right after tom saves you when up if you look at Sammy's body it melts away

This could be just the games way of getting rid of him but still
#teambendy
I'm getting vibs of undertail with the souls
4:52 
Matpat how dare you, I thought you were use the Mathematical term "Scatterplot" instead.
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly
Bendy is bacc
YOU HAVENT FINISHED THE HELLO NEIGHBOR GAME THERES STILL CANON STORIES AND FACTS!!!!
But Bendy is facing the Butcher Gang, as if he's about to fight them.
is that Alice Angel at the beginning of the Dark Revival teaser?
You know I think matpat just bought a green screen
Guys you wont even believe it!!




PETSCOP RELEASED MORE EPISODES


like if you want matpat to do another theory on petscop! We need matpat to notice this comment
This reminds of undertale when they said ‚Äúchoices‚Äù
I don't know if it's my phone or what, but the volume in this video fluctuates like crazy. Soft, then loud, then normal...
Oooh, love the new format, with seeing MatPat.
"Hangy dangly bits" uhhh the pulley system? xD
fans: "can we plase have a way to end the loop somehow?"
other game creators:
meatly: "hold my bacon soup!"
I've been thinking why doesn't Sans n papyrus show their other hand it's something me and a lot of my friends been thinking about.
Can we see a theory about how realistic rocket league is?
"ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER
i
I would play bendy hangman
"Oh I will show you a bigger target"...
You should do a S.T.A.L.K.E.R theory or something or maybe get Austin to do a ‚ÄúTHE SCIENCE!‚Äù On it
4:39 MEME REVIEW!!!!
When the game comes out I'm with bendy
Wait.......







April 14th is my birth date 




Wow
MatPat: You're supposed to throw it at my hand!
Chris: Your head is a bigger target


Me: I get that all the time

5:44 HOLY CRAP! "PHONE GUY CALLS" IS IN PURPLE TEXT!
MatPat: another year will pass untill i'll make next petscop theory
Paul: HOLD MY EASTER EGGS!
Matpat: When will these creators DIE?
Creators: yes

#team bendy!
So are we playing as Henry or not
:I i like the mattpatt where he basicly never shows his face
Matpat using the word ‚ÄòShooketh‚Äô

Actually has me SHOOKETH üòÇüòÇ
Ugh. I'd honestly like to go back to before this green screen business.
If it wasn't for Austin's vids, I'd honestly unsub. But sigh. Here we are.
That middle one gives a whole new meaning to speak your mind XD
Please let this big bad guy of this new game be an evil Boris
MAKE IT HAPPEN MEATLY!
I'm team Bendy. Not Alice
MatPat: "Finally! I've got all the theories down, whether they're confirmed or not!"
TheMeatly: "That's Where Your Wrong Kiddo"
Every Franchise creator ever: i am SOON done with this game! I'm just gonna post a little teaser...

MatPat: Hold my Diet Coke
Meme review
Was the voice at the end bendy or even the ink machine.
I kinda like this new format
Just throwing this out there but.... 414?
...DAD?
I think the mysterious voice is perhaps a competitor of Joey Drew Studios who went there.
Can you do a new theory about FANF please? If you love us üíó
Do granny please!!!
NO, different sammy, in chapter 5, he melts away
I seriously miss stock image mat pat, please bring him back.......
I'm already trying not to wake my family with laughter
Bendy Alice no i go Solo team's are for the week
"oh ill show u a bigger target," matpat 2019
"oh ill show u a bigger target," matpat 2019
I love how Matt is appearing more in his videos , face to face with us, instead of just behind a screen... speaking into a microphone.. in a closet...

üíÄüòÇ
Is it just me or bendy looks a lot like Sans + Mxkey Mouse
Bendy talks!!
I bet it's some kind of private investigator who accidently turns on the ink machine or something
BATDR aka Bendy At The Death Row.
Just wanted to say that I'm really enjoying the new video style you've been doing, and this video especially had some great editing. That Bendy corridor scene was brilliant, and I just wanted to show my appreciation for all the hard editing work that goes into these things.
18:04



Matpat just  to put that meme in there, didn't he
I want to see both but................ ...
what if the player is this unknown observer
I wonder if the intro was well scripted, or non-intetional and editors just kept it in :)
0:08 - When you think about asking your crush out
0:10 - When you get denied/friend-zoned
live action episodes sound like i'm back to university being asleep at desk in 2000s
I like this new style. Kudos to the editors, and Mat!
BATIM: Civil War.
That intro though!
Perfect
when pokemon comes back with plot holes


matpat making theories


when bendy comes back


matpat makes MORE theories...but in a closet...the usual closet


when FNAF comes back....


matpat makes ALOT of theories, in a closet... cries a river...while drinkin his usual diet coke


Steph: there he goes again

Actually I never got these many likes! Thanks guys!
Also it did say starting new year in chapter 1
was the attack plunger an actual mistake? XD
I think the Searchers and Butcher gang are not on Bendy's side, but are afraid to fight back, after all, why would he kill them if their on his team, also, remember, Walk with the angels... Cower before demons...
MatPat. You predicted T-Series would win. It is time to redeam yourself. Help save YouTube. üëä
Hey MatPat, have you seen the new petscop videos?
I think that wasnt a new character, I think it was just a character who came back to the studio and just heard about what's going on there.
And I think the one who said "Benevolent Demon, Someone has reawakened the dark", I think it could be the "old" character In my perspective and this is just my opinion.
17:15 has anyone else noticed that sammy is lowkey ripped????
Bendy and Henry might team to deafat the knew charcter
Team angel!!!!
Hey MatPat two words:

Petscop. Updated.
You can always look to the past to see what youve accomplished.
Hey matpat, could you do a theory on tourge weapons from borderlands? Maybe the realism of them?
11:17 lol, you said Alison Angel. You'll get totally different results if you google that name instead.
When I went back to replay the game I saw some stuff I didn't in the beginning and the update for the chapter
Matpat: Pick Alice or Bendy!

Me: but there both villains...

Matpat, Mike, and Meatly: 
Hi I would like you to investigate loot lake dust divot 2.0??
okay all the love in the world, but I lowkey like the voice overs better.
1:51 = my reaction to sammy lawrence in chapter 5
Holy crap I just realised, 14 Apr is my bday. Looks like April‚Äôs been a big month for a lot of stuff
I'm in and from North Carolina ;-)
#teamdemon
petscop is back my bro
MatPat: Finally I‚Äôm done with the franchise 

Every Game Developer: How many times do we have to teach you old man?
Bendy and the Dark Revival: Exists

Theorists: ‚ÄúHow very interesting... such knowledge‚Äù
So you mean this is bendy game but from another universe
Like for Team Demon Reply for Team Angel
I wonder how many times he had to get hit in the head with the plunger to get that intro scene correctüò≠üò≠
The demon route is just the original game
Bendy and the Ink Machine: * new secrets are revealed *

Matpat: you made me use 10% of my theorist powers
Jason just evolved from #BLAMEJASON to #SAVAGEJASON
So Bendy something blah blah blah is Splatoons slatfests but in the Bendy universe. Okay I can deal with that
Bendy: shut your mouth please don't spoil the game>.<
Oh sorry
Bendy: thanks
Halfway through the video and we are only just told what the question for today is XD
Dude your videos have help me with so much stuff im learning in school this year
New Bendy Game: I‚Äôm Baaaaack!

MatPat: screams in hidden text files
Can you do the kirby god of destruction thingumajig now
Through the whole video I was like WHAAAAAAA?!
I miss being able to picture matpat reading off the video script in his closet...
Personally I prefer your old editing on your videos but you still make good videos no hate bro.
Beautiful theory...
And very very interesting...






Such 
the trailer said RETURN to the studio nothing else
14:18 jumpscare? I didn't notice it when I watch the trailer the first time
.i shink it star war the choses you make what
Have you ever thought of doing a video on SCP? There is so much theorizable material in it! I even have some theories on it! I can go into detail if people ask!
Also, sorry for being off topic... I just find SCP really cool...
Rip the guys that threw that plunger


F to pay respects
0:18 Thanos: You Should Have Aimed For The Hea- Oh
But who is evil, the angel or the demon?üòáüòà
MATPAT TILTED TOWERS GOT DESTROYED ON FORTNITE! YOU HAVE TO DO A THEORY ON THIS.
There watching you but they do what it takes to stay alive
One minute's silence for the guy that threw the plunger please....you'll always be remembered as...




the guy that threw the plunger. RIP.
Who else noticed the face behind matpat at
6:50
who is observing henry? well security cams of course!
Love the new editing style!
Everytime he said my name (Alice) I got really exited üòÇüòÇ
Roses are red
Ink is black
I sold my soul








To the demon who's back


Edit: omg thanks for the likes and the ‚ù§Ô∏è matpat!
I will side with bendy #bendythedemon
I have a theory, I think Sammy Summoned something.


Something that made him go mad, while also making him immortal, unless killed by the hands of a human.
I think I actually noticed the mask but I didn‚Äôt think it meant anything important I just thought it was there for the background same with the candles  üïØ
Looks like Matpat has chosen to cower before the editing demons xD
Fnaf, Bendy AND petscop 
We have truly been blessed by the theorist gods
14:21 theres someone between the pipers knees


old man, sunken face, balding head, 
it sorta looks like joey but zombie-like
Do you mean when Henry goes into the 414 loop things will change
I like your new green screen matpat
your rocking the green screen
edit: thanks for the new game disclaimer I'm probably going to play (the old one and probably the new one) it on my channel
In bendy and the ink machine each time the light goes off let's say when the projectionists during chapter 4 when the player turn the light off he disappears so just something in the dark but is taking the ink monsters
People: Undertale is the only game that has a neither sequel nor prequel game!!




Meatly: 
Does anyone notice the dark figure with eyes standing beind matt at the point 6:50......or Is it just me üòÖ
Has anyone checked out the YouTuber superhorrorbro? He's really cool and I suggest you should watch his bendy theories.
Can you make A MK11 STORY mode
matt im addicted to you bro i love your vids soooooo much
MatPat : your supposed to throw it in my hand!
Chris: your heads a bigger target ü§£
Matpat: oh I'll show you a bigger target üòà
*intro plays...
Awesome theory!
But I still believe that unknown voice is Bendys,who's possibly gained a soul of his own hence why he can talk just like that.
The Twitter post about someone reawakening the dark isn't from Bendy's point of view,but it's definitely from someone else,like say Sammy.
Maybe Bendy  the one reawakening the dark,and Sammy doesn't know it was him when he said "Benevolent demon,someone has reawakened the dark" to his Lord.
That's  theory anyway. We'll never truly know until the game comes out and/or more details are revealed for the games release.
As for the team I'm choosing,I choose...

...Boris. He's just there for the food,and that's my kind of leader.
Matt you have such a nerdy Jake Peralta energy
Or it could be alice angle being reawakend seeing that we hear alices voice that might be somthing mat
4:43 the scatter plot triggered my math ptsd. I HATE scatter plots
What if The observer is us, the players, "reawakening" evil by playing the game over and over. But this time, we have the option to decide, to choose a different ending, therefore changing the loop and leaving the game behind for good.
EDIT: omg, I didn't expect so many likes 0-0 Thank you all so much!
You know what would be cool?, in batDR you wake up in the studio and the ending is where you meet Tom and it is revealed you play as Allison angel
well whatever happens im on #TeamBendy 'cause i hate alice
no no no no no no
is that you scott cawthon?
telling us a series is over and then making a new game?
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Your  my favorite host of all the shows I watch
I like how he very slowly transitioned from just voice acting the episodes to actually being in the episodes.  That's a lot better for the editing I think.
He released 5 videos in one day
How his Sammy souls gots his body game theory here my guess his devil friends
6:51 matpat's about to get screwed...
Matt is just enjoying the green screen now XD
Mat 
414 make it letters 
You get 



D
A
D 
Could Henry's dad be talking??????
bendy vs Alice 
b vs A
Dx army : that's not Sammy because Sammy died in chapter 2 

Mat Pat : Sammy got reborn between those 2 chapters
Mat pat : they broke the loop
Bo4: wait hold a sec
I just remembered. Wasn't there an update where they removed the detail of Sammy's "death". When chapter 2 was first released, we saw his "ink blood" spill from the door. After a few updates, they removed that detail. So am I missing something or what is it? 


Regardless, love your videos. Have fun.
Batim: someone has reawakened the dark
Fnaf: we let something in, it was a accident 

Oh boy
All we need is for Tom to speak to see if he sounds like his audio in chapter 3
I think I accidentally took that intro too seriously haha...
Hey matt patt iron man died so where's your theory now
4:35 woah, when did I start watching vsauce but hosted by matpat?
3:32 That mask near that spawner isn't the actual mask Sammy was wearing in chapter 2.
How do I know?
There's a mouthhole on Sammy's mask, but there isn't a mouthhole on the mask next to the spawner.
...wonderful. I can see this becoming the new FNAF. Accept the editing is much better :]
I just remembered something important about Sammy Lawrence in Chapter 5: that it's not truly him. Because when he dies, his body melts away after a while. Plus, his voice is WAY different. From a smoothish voice to an echoing howl, it's clear that he is not the same as he was in Chapter 2.
The tommy gun is obviously Thomas Connor's
#teamaliceangel
‚ÄúOh I will show you a bigger target‚Äù what are you implying...?
Which route MatPat...?




The Bendy Route...?
or the FNAF Route...?





Chose wisely...






(PS DO BENDY! I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT GAME! I DON'T EVEN LIKE FNAF)
He sounds like  sammy the recording
I saw before the intro and already love this episode
New voice actor is probably the old gods :)
Devs be like: "Hey i like making this guy struggle for weeks and my game be on his videos!"
releases 10 updates
Hearts out to the editors who made this video!!!!!
Kann you just be a Photoshop caracter again Pleas
check 6:50 there's a ghost behind Matpat. lol
'Oh I'll show you a bigger target' Matthew Patrick 2019
Toby Fox to take on earthbound series
MatPat: Cries in wingdings
Your head‚Äôs a bigger target

Lol
What is the observer is a butcher gang member and creating clones of the butcher gang
Is it me or do I think that he puts more effort in film theory lol
please make a video on how king crimson works
FNAF: I HAZ NEW GAME!

Bendy: I haz new game too

Mat: Am I joke to you?
So what if this unknown character wanted to interact with Henry causing the loop to change and the game to become multiplayer would it still be a side story or a sequel?
Voice of 
Unknown
but where does Boris come in? is HE the one in shadows?
International Rescue has a saying "it's never over'
Petscop released episode 17-21 




Get working MatPat
#TEAMBENDY
i knew this gonna happen :>-
The time loop got to stop which mean the story has changed (but that my theory)
Wait... deltarune has the dark world. in deltarune, choice is dead. There's choice in bendy and the dark revival. Revival is bringing something dead back to life. deltarune and bendy and the dark revival are not sequels or prequels. 

DELTARUNE AND BENDY AND THE DARK REVIVAL CROSSOVER

This is a joke
I think it‚Äôs an audio of Sammy dying. Then being turned to ink.
Can you figure out Who is this [hex maniac]
Honestly you should try a sso theory  ( star stable online ) it's kinda.... well let's just say the theories are all over the place
Hey thought I would bring this up but matpat YOU DIED IN ESCAPE THE NIGHT HOW ARE YOU ALIVE realizes oh you came back to life
Mattpat: now that fnaf and batim as come to a conclusion, I can finally take a break.

Fnaf: Announce 7-8 new projects with one coming soon

Mattpat: Oh boy... At least it‚Äôs only one of them

Batdr: Wait for me !
What is that? A tYpO iN THe DesCRiPtIoN??
What if the observer ment to be the player itself?
I love the new style in the video. You go theorist team!!
Seeing you in while doing it in video is . . . I dunno
I had to stop watching another Game Theory to come and watch this Game Theory! üòÇ
April the 14th is my birthday lmao
WHAT HAPPENED TO NRMAN, THE PROJECTIONIST????? HE NEVER APPEARED IN THE ARCHIVES, AND HE'S JUST LIKE THE BUTCHER GANG, LITTLE THOUGHT ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!
I want that liar necklace is it on your merch store
For anyone that‚Äôs from bijuus vid: 1:54!
MatPat: Finally, I'm done with BATIM.
Dark Revival is announced
MatPat: Ah Sh**, here we go again.
Thats my birth day ;)
Why hello there
   (\/)
\(^~^)/
2:07

sighhhhhhhhhhhh
Venom hiding in bendy? Confirmed
Mabey it could follow another character and we could see whatever happened to the other characters
I think every game creator who's games Mat makes a theory over has a bet to see who can make him snap first
Matpat watch outn something is behind you. Oh no he has airpods in he can't hear me 6:49
This vid actually helped me on the state test
B-B-B-Bendy and the jets
4:40, turn on closed captions when he claps üëå
I love the new direction this channel is going. Mostly cuz I can see you enjoy the acting, your theatre kid is showing.
You are gonna be the daddest dad ever.
And damn, these editors are snarky. Awesome editing btw. I hope you guys get paid a salary, because this looks like a lot of work. A LOT.


I remember the first FNAF theory. You were so full of life and excited about the series. Now you just look like a kid who has four exams in one day. Someday it may be laid to rest
Someday. When we are all dead.
I miss old game theory
#TEAMBENDY BOISSSSS
Indie horror games are going to be the death of MatPat this year
Remember the try not the cry on FBE well that‚Äôs got out my bright seeing you cry

Edit: Sammy was probably there because he makes Sammy‚Äôs to continue his life over and over that is how he comes back from making himself before he even dies
Thumbnail: Ahh yes it is Banos who wields the Infinity Pencil
What music is that witch play at the beginning in the background?
i think that tommy gun belonged to striker when he was a human. because you said that they are being punished. so fisher is a liar, striker is a killer, and piper, i will edit this soon.


EDIT: i forgot to say that strikers name is STRIKER and most people if they were in military they would say fire or strike.


EDIT 2: piper is being punished, for having something to do with this whole ink machine malfunction and making this studio a death trap. because his name is PIPEr but he has a wrench. so he must have been punished for making messing around in the ink machine then BAM! EVERYONE IS SUFFERING! then 15 years later joey tells Henry to come back and boom!
Mat in this video: fnaf isen't a noisy game

Earlier vids: this is so loud
these games look incredibly fun but I don't have the patience to deal with that difficult learning curve
0:25 GET EM!!
The opining.

lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
MatPat: Make it happen editors!!!
Editors: lets make a fool of this guy instead, we work too hard
MatPat is thrown into the trash can
I love how at 16:24 Alice is holding a Hylian shield XD
#TeamBendy, anyone?
Can you do a theory on the game Rime?
#teamBendy
Demons: Bendy
Angels: Alice
The thing that‚Äôs watching: BORIS

I KNEW BORIS WAS JESUS
I love this new FMV MattPat style of video
IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!

#TEAMBENDY
MatPat: Everybody's favourite game theory 
Me: KINDERGARTEN
MatPat: FNAF
Me: WHY, WHY, MATPAT
Your right butcher gang has back story others not true I'm one of the @$#@ can't tell
Roses are red

Violets are blue

Bendy isn‚Äôt dead and you aren‚Äôt to
So, bit of religious lore for some people.
Many believe there is another being out there many think is an 'observer'. Some think that this being is known as god, and merely watches what the demons and angels do. They have no stake in the outcome, just enjoys the show being put on. 


Translate this to Bendy could be that Joey is the Demon, while the ink creations of Alice and Borris are Angels. What would that make Henry? Humanity. Both sides are fighting to have humanity, but for whatever purpose they desire. (Fun fact: Some think Angels are very nice creatures.) Meanwhile there is God, the 'Observer' as you call him, who watches this fight and gather the data to make the conclusion of if one goes to Hell or Heaven. He doesn't control the outcome, he just watches how it changes.
Sees this person watching Henry and them has seen this play out many times. Each time recording the different out come. Can't say for what yet, but seems to be a gathering of data. Maybe to create a new being, or just for personal amusement. 


That's my two cents as it is.
also, they did ask salad or soup so that could be an almost teaser, ya know?
I just realized B.E in Bend sounds like believe
IS THE MEATLY RELATED TO SCOTT??!!? Gees they don‚Äôt let Matpat rest.
Edit: How the heck did I get 73 likes?!!?
Another edit: 138 likes?!? That‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever gotten!!

#TEAM BENDY
With the borderlands reference at 17:30 can we get another borderlands themed theory? maybe when BL3 comes out?
i like the green screen
Lmao creators never give MattPat a chance of glory
This video's intro was the best in Game Theory history!
A new game...I am so hyped
#teambendy because Alice is just gruesome and mean
play btim chapter 2 and look at the ink
8:56 There is a third one were the game just ends in a point were it doesn't make sense but picks up right back were you left off in the new game with a different title(Golden sun for ex)
You guys still remember the ‚Äòsuper end-card tournament‚Äô I miss it... I hope they bring it back.
#teambendy
#TeamBendy
What if it's US (aka Henry) that's reawakening the dark, since we're the one that turned the ink machine on because we were told to by...us due to the fact that we're, unknowingly, putting ourselves in the loop? Kind of like that "important peach" from Milo Murphy's Law.
#TeamBendy
FNAF comming back, Bendy comming back, a new Petscop! Next thing you know..........





What good are words when a smile says it all
Hold on a freaking frack, theres a youtuber named dx army? I feel attacked

Oh?
"Benevolent Demon" is also where the name Bendy comes from, right? Ben-De.
I wonder if that beginning joke was scripted
Hey MattPatt,
You still have't apologized for that TF2 vs. Overwatch video you did.
Don't start thinking that two years is enough for everyone to forget your mistakes.
You even have the audacity to delete reasonable complaint comments on that video, let alone keep the video posted online.
That video shows a severe lack of research and respect, especially with respect to TF2. You spent more time editing than you did actually getting good info.
Now let us review what choices you have:
You can either delete that video and post a sincere apology, or you can leave that video alone as an eternal reminder of how low-quality and uninformed your videos actually are.
Anyone else find that the ads totally ruin the experience and trains of thought?
The thing about choice, it reminds me of Undertale-
That hurt! Man, it's times like this I wish I had an attack plumber.

Mario and Plumber Society: Boys and girls, it's time to recruit!
Matpat: it‚Äôs not a prequel it‚Äôs not a sequel me: ITS A THREEQUILL matpat: ultimate universe and side story
He yeeted bendy franchise : )
Bendy melts at the end
#teambendy

#teambendy
i love batim my favorite characters are norman and sammy
‚ÄúOh, I will show you a bigger target.‚Äù XDDDDD
(I liked my own comment. I‚Äôm sad.)
EDIT: BRO WHAT THAT MANY LIKES AMG THANK U SO MUCH!!!
And thats workplace abuse
They call him. The observer he watches from the dark to feed
Something is behind him in the door way 6:50
My reaction to Sammy coming back was "I knew it I knew Sammy was coming back" no lie I'm serious
Edit:I knew Sammy was coming back (not really but it was a guess)it was because how some of the other characters like Boris comes back Norman polk sometimes comes back in the butcher gang comes back so thinking Sammy is going to come back in chapter 5 I know it 

Hey I'm sorry it's sooooooo long
Is like nobody talking about petscop right now

They are going crazy
6:50 there's something behind you, MatPat... hm
0:14 - 0:26




XD
17:31 I love the awesome refrance
do you have discord mattpat?
New Petscop gameplay was just added to the Petscop channel...... immediately after Bendy and Fnaf just revealed their new games..... I feel for you Mat...
#teamBendy
If Chris hadn't been there on the last live stream we were gonna have to call the police.
#teamsammy
the date in the game is 1966! Wikipedia told me the year of the game and the plot of it!
MatPat: "Turn me to a puddle of ink!"
Editor: Throws MatPat into the trash

Edit: Omg... i never this many likes before üòÆ THANK YOU ALL üòÉ
Bendy: Endgame
I actually found the Sammy mask in ch4 on accident lol
And people have compares the mysterious voice in the audio log to Sammy.
And if Bendy and the Butcher Gang are on the same side, then why when Bendy is in range of the Butcher Gang, he has no reaction to killing them? The only one he's focus on is Henry. Not Boris or the Butcher Gang, even though Boris has done some mean stuff to him in the cartoons like eating his food and scaring the poor guy, in the cartoon the Butcher Gang appear in, Charlie is forcing him to pay for the food and they chase him when he doesn't. Bendy just kills them because they're in his way.
Matpat: I WILL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET!!!
The bigger target: ‚Äòchuckles‚Äô I‚Äôm in danger
Alternate universe like in undertale
I really like this new format for the Game theories. This type of change is good.
This new...format gives me mixed feelings. I like the cartoons more than the green screen stuff :^/
You should make a comic theory with a blue thing
#teambendy
Quality intros as always, MatPat.
#TEAMBENDY
I will show you a bigger target!
* Whips out meat scepter *
Now u mention it, here's my theory...


So you said the butcher gang being punished but, it could be true, but however, when Joey drew and Henry left the studios it became more likely a betrayal for the cartoon characters. Maybe then Alice Angel would have to do something about the butcher gang because in chapter 3 we saw all the dead boris's and before the death of most boris, Alice had done things with the butcher gang, if you look closely to the the fisher person in the butcher gang, The fishing rod is holding his head ( if you haven't notice ) all fishermen uses fishing rods so if the fisher butcher gang person was holding it, Alice must'vs broke them a apart, but what about bendy though? Bendy was the one who MUST'VE 
put them bad together that way, but looking at the other butcher gang member, his mouth is and the top of his head, but his other mouth got stitch up? No way how is it that he have 2 mouths at the same time, Alice Angel stitch one of his mouth, bendy placed another, that way I be easier for him to talk that way....



NO, that butcher gang member barely said nothing, maybe Alice clogged his upper mouth until he couldn't talk again.



So to solve tho butcher gangs problem.
-Alice broke them
-bendy fixed them
-But we haven't found out nothing yet.
:6:50: oh no look out
Woah the handsome face reveal
Matt Pat I just gotta say that I love your jacket.
Matpat: Fnaf is back now bendy I LOVE MY JOB (sarcastic)

Video game designers: mahhahahahahahaha
Can you do a theory about Virtual Virtual Reality?
But there's something I don't understand : if the ink beings with souls doesn't melt away like the others, then why does Sammy melt ?
#teamsammy has a certain ring
If in the original game it says 414 what would happen if you played it again 414 times what would happen?
#TEAMBENDY
Matpat makes this game sound like a Warriors Title
I love the new way he does his vidoes
You would make such a great detective
Mat: u ment to throw it at my hand


Your head is a bigger target


Mat:I'll show you a bigger target
What the hell my science fair is thr lmao
Wow the date of my birthday is in the game 414.....cool
#teambendy
Is MatPat forever now going to do real life MatPat in his videos? I miss the characters, the editing and animations
Bendy: Bendy comes back.

Matpat: Ah shyet, here we go again.
It‚Äôs not his mask there‚Äôs no mouth hole
#teambendy
1:54 it is BIJUU MIKE






cool:)
BTW im really enjoying the live action game theory episodes, keep up the good work!
Listen to all the audio tapes there somebody new in one of them
#teambendy
YES!! CHRIS PARTICIPATION!!!
#teambendy
You should make a video of the difference between left and right Twix‚Äôs
The beginning of the video has me dying
Man found impaled by a plunger in the home of YouTube channel ‚ÄúGame Theory‚Äù
#teambenndy or #teamales
#teambendy
MatPat : AND FINALLY, THE MYSTERY IS OVER!

Literally every dev : lol no
#TeamBendy
#teambendy
First fnaf now bendy
When  it takes 8 minutes to get to the question of the episode
matpat talks about the butcher gang being destroyed and reassembled
me: gets Frankenstein vibes
#TeamBoris
Bendy and the black water machine
Bendy is back
Loved that opening XD
When I saw this video, I finally found out a sequel for bendy was being made.

I immediately started yelling
#TeamBendy
6:45 TheMeatly (right)
Dark bendy
Do you know what does that weird voice sounds like
A cartoon character
A voice actor
If Alice had a voice actor what won't bendy have one 
Maybe bendy had one 
Maybe he was a big part of all of this 
His cartooni voice fits too much for bendy
"I'll show you a bigger target!"


What does he mean by THAT!?
#teambendy
#TeamBendy
I‚Äôm gonna melt when I die.
Thats not Sammys mask Sammy has the mouth cut out
I miss the fully animated theories.
BENDY FOREVER
The "not a prequel or a sequel" thing reminds me of deltarune
You should do a theory about Jak and Daxter, like is Jak really Mar
if this theory is right, team alice
Mat pat: makes 8 minutes of him talking that‚Äôs the question for today
Best intro ever
Best theorists I know!
This reminds me of when the first super smash Bros ultimate teaser came out... We only had one single fact to go off of.
Mat pat plz do a theory on the Kirlian frequency it‚Äôs a really good show
Team bendy yeah
Mat pat: ILL SHOW U A BIGGER TARGET
*throws a plunger

Some dude: AAAAHHHGG
I vote team angel because I HATE the butcher gang. The're creepy
what if we play as bendy
hay MatPat: do a slender man theory plz. :)
#TeamBender
Ah, there it is. Game Theory's hilarious intros are back.=3
Henry is in a time lope like in fnaf
SHOOKETH BOIII
# team bendy
If we do get to pick sides, I‚Äôm always going for the Demon
MatPat: makes bendy video
Petscop: have fun
Hey MatPat, I love your video and you should really do a theory over the game ARK. At first it may not seem to have a story but nothing is a it seems.
long nose and the sign that says liar I always thought it was a Pinocchio reference
What if it's a prequel
This is amazing
Bendy and the dark Revival...
Cringy intro...again
dear MattPat please do a "SCP" theary i would live to see it.
#TEAM ANGEL üëå
Petscop alert!!! There are new episodes and we're waiting
oh damn, he got BIJUU MIKE
Jezus first fnaf vr now the new bendy game...Playstation is threatening to kill these people to get their games
Every time I see one of his video I get freaking gousebumps
Let‚Äôs face it bendy and fanfs story line is really hard to understand
I believe the observer is you, it also explains why you would have more choice.
I miss the old edit than the new one
#TeamANGEL
An 8 minute setup...k
What if you play as wally franks in the new game it makes sense
bendy: I can't be erased
I pull out white out
Hey do you think you could make a theory about payday 2 as kind of celebrating its end
Game theory chapter ? At the end menu or the game
You should make a book!
THIS IS UNDERTALE // DELTARUNE ALL OVER AGAIN.
Go back to the other editing please
Or it might be a new story Being telled by Joey drew
Bendy:WHAT DO WE WANT?
The end of the game:for the game to end
Bendy:WRONG A ANOTHER GAME
11:04 this dude isn't looking into the hole xD
Matpat:*finishes ‚Äúfinal‚Äù theory for Batim* aaaah now I can relax!

Bendy:*throws another game into his face* IM BACK BOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIII 

Matpat:NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Editor:*throws mattpat in a trash can*
I don‚Äôt know if this is just me but the butcher gang members remind of see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil
i have a good theory!! why doesnt pikachu evolve
Matpat have you noticed that bendy in the final boss fight, melts away when you place the end in the projector?
That means he does not have a human soul in it and so is he made of ink. So bendy wasin't a human or this one is not a human
Ah yes. I've been waiting for this.
MatPat and the Theory Machine

Or rather MatPat: the Theory Machine
TEAM BENDY
we will proboly see our face soon
Editors note: MATPAT ENTERED THE HOLE
4 NEW EPISODES OF PETSCOP!!!! THEY ARE ONLINE!!!
Scott Cawthon and TheMeatly made a new 2019 game?

Cmon Toby Fox your falling behind!
Team bendy
I've seen that premier 414. And the channel.
Joey draw rights the story, hes probably relieing on henry to choose that story
I think BATDR is pulling a Star Wars by having This observing character be their version of Palpatine the one who‚Äôs pulling the strings and making two forces (I.e heaven and hell, good and evil, demons and angels, or Bendy and Alice) fight each other and the monsters are the class that are picking sides. Our choices will matter but if we choose either side I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll make it out of the loop. No I think what really needs to happen is that we need to unite both sides in order to take down Joey and the observer.
If Bendy 2 is so great, then why isn‚Äôt there a Bendy 2 2?
Game theroy you should do a theroy on mortal kombat 11
Or maybe Henry awakened the dark in the loop to stop it so when it‚Äôs done the loop is finished
i sAw zenyatTa
bendy themed splatfest
#TeamAngel
9:41 Error 414?
12:15 you jumpscared me with this zombie
Wait does that mean we can‚Äôt plants and we are going out to play some guy who goes in trying to find the imaging but everything is the same day he discover
New Bendy game!
MatPat: hold my Diet Coke‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
What are u? #TeamAngel or #TeamDemon?
0:09
14:13
Lol
I think ü§î that Joey is trying to make a new caricature
I knew this I saw I was going to tell you
#team angle
I thought it would be after the puppet cowboy game
I got a theory for you that you can probably solve
How does Leon from Resident Evil 4 dodge the lasers? Could he be as fast as a car? What speed is he on? Could a real human do that. 
Is he vulnerable to bites of zombies (mostly zombie dogs).
3:42 what if Sammy fell in, which is why the mask is the only thing left, or someone or something pulled him in???? Just a theory
I hope Jason gets incorporated into the main GT series more. He's great.
video quality is getting worse and worse :(
Alice the angel tries to direct peopole right? And if the buchure gang is working for bendy and Alice is agent bendy she might of done somthing to them but bendy helped them come back to life.
I think you‚Äôre going to go to the future and Henry will had to try to set them free again so I think it would just be the same game
#teamwallyfranks
IM GONNA SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET!

law and order: BUM BUM
Shook-ith.
Where is doki doki literature club theory!?!?!?
6:23 OH NO DA HORD OF DA BUCHER GANG XD
#teamangel
Hey Mat, 2 new Petscop episodes came out.
Lol this came out on my b-day
I miss the old format
6:43 u see De Meatly there
So, while I have not played any of the games, I've watched your videos and read the wikis. One of the theories I have is, Will the next game be impacted by your save files?

Like with Undertale and other games, do the bendy games hide the data in a way that your previous choices will be reflected on? Is there a path of 'redemption '?
Hangly Dangly Bits
Nubblies
The things we hear from matpatüòÇ
That first candle thing was a bit of a stretch but eehh
Frick my name is Henry
The mystery voice sounds like the joker
The editing in this video is awesome!!!
You said that the 'Observer', who is supposedly watching Henry, is trying to switch Henry's fate. What if this person is trying to save Henry? To end this loop that he's been trapped in.
Hey mat pat 
For the endgame episode
Yes it travels in a straight line but it also looks in on itself constantly when one of it happens it will always happen they're not going through it for the first time there reliving it
Sammy could have reawaken it
Maybe it is the good bendy
I always walk with the angels.
Who else dances the wEiRdEsT dance when the intro comes on?





just me? oki... ;-;
I have a feeling that the game will come out on 7 August cause when i was watching your old stream video of chapter 5 of bendy, the calender wrote 7 august and as you figured out that the unknown voice tape was published on 414 (April 14) I might think that they also gave us the game publishing date or trailer date(i don't think that the trailer will come out that late).Hey!but thats just a theory a game theory and thanks for reading it so far.‚ò∫
MatPat: They are a possessed cartoon, but a cartoon none the less. The Watcher/Observer is the Audience. The Time Loop is a Re-run
So it's DustTale.
What is this other thing me con fusing
No Matpats were hurt in the making of this video.
#TeamAngel
I see what MatPats saying! Purple guy is actually bendy! And that Freddy Alice! Which means the ink represents the pizzeria in FNAF! ITS ALL COMING TOGETHER!!!
6:45 that's really cool editing
#team theorist
Matpat: * Bendy theory *
Everybody: another one 
DJ khalid: Another One!!
Bendy: here we go again
#Teamdemon
I dont know how to feel about this new style
#Anlgeteam
The first part the plunger is funny
Hm... at 4:29 there is a poster that says "The Family Fallout Shelter". Fallout 4 is a family Fallout Shelter. Can Bendy and the Ink Machine be connected to Fallout 4 somehow?
When you can‚Äôt say which one you want to pick#anglebendy
ITS BIJUUU MIKKKEEEE
I need the greenscreen of that plunger
I love the fact that he‚Äôs used the same cutouts for a long time. And I‚Äôm not being sarcastic, it kind of gives it a bit of nostalgia.
oof lets see how this goes
#TeamAngel
6:50 (behind him) scooty le doody he comin' for dat booty
#Team Angel!
MatPat's Ultimate nightmare: 
Five Nights at Bendy's VR
Okay, so, I think I may have found something. If someone else has pointed this out, please please please let me know because I don't want to feel like I'm taking someone else's idea. 


Okay so get this. There's going to be a second Bendy game, right? And you know how the creators said it wasn't going to be a prequel or a sequel? I think I know where this is going. So you know when you finally beat the game of Bendy and the Ink Machine, and you get through all the credits and whatnot. You get a cut scene of the camera panning along the room and ending on a picture of Bendy, Borris, and Alice with Henry's signature wishing Joey the best and wishing him success. The only piece of dialogue that comes during that scene comes from a little girl (or boy I could be deaf) saying "Tell me another one, Uncle Joey."  and then the game ends for good. This piece of "evidence" (if you'd even call it that) signals the audience that the first game was a story that Joey was telling a child, his niece or nephew. This is what I believe the second game is. It's Joey telling the child another story. Another story about Bendy's journey. 


That's all I was able to think of, please feel free to add onto it and please also tell me if someone has already pieced this together because I don't want to tell this fandom anything it already knows. Thanks again and have a great  day/night. :)
maybe it a april fool
can someone make an edit of the video of the first 13 seconds and change it when Peter Griffin falls on his knee. ps I u do can ya send it to me
It‚Äôs obvious, the one the tommy gun belonged to and the one who‚Äôs going to break the cycle is Albert Arlington!
*when ever you accidentally press new game*

Game theory:
Does anyone else wonder why Matt suddenly started using green screen?
I think by now, we all adore how MatPat says "but thats just a theory, a game theory" And we all know it isnt a theory.
I miss cutout Mat
When I saw that the belt on The Fisher said "LIAR," I was thinking that the butcher gang had been betrayed, pulled apart, and put back together, based on the character design. when you said they may have been punished, it made me want to look deeper into it. Though, i'm no expert on theorizing, that's only what a think. the butcher gang was betrayed, pulled apart, and put back together.. but in a way to make them look like monsters.
It says 2 views and 237 likes ummmmmm YouTube is drunk also IM FINALLY EARLY YAY
I think that Sammy was the one that was summoned, cause we did watch him die and now he‚Äôs back, so that‚Äôs why I think he was summoned at that stop with his candle around
That intro was great
What if the reason why things change with each chapter release is because it's another loop or reality? You think your continuing the exact samebut it's really just another similar loop
He said shooketh
I‚Äôm having trouble getting used to the new editing style I don‚Äôt think I like it but I know your doing your best thanks for everything you do
8:05 that was the intro.....
fishers i mean
Does that mean Sammy doesn't have a soul
SUCH........





KNOLEDGE......
lol i havent even touched this game but im up to date with the theories
4:41 closed captions, I saw that
I would like there to be another borderlands theory.
Yasssssssssssssssssssssssss!
Is Mat doing live sketches now?
BatIM: Protagonist is named Henry No-Last-Name and his former business partner is Joey Drew

FNaF: One  protagonist is named Henry No-Last-Name and HIS former  business partner is William Afton

Both Joey and William were complete psychopaths

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oh I'm sorry pal. Am I getting too much for you? Heh heh.
At 6:50 ypu can see bendy behind matpat :O
Line of best fit
Petscop released 2 new videos...
Hello Mr. Patrick, Mrs. Patrick and the rest of the Game Theory crew,

After hearing the announcement of Borderlands 3 being released sometime this year, my brother (linguaphiliax) and I (Jac.A.Cameron) had come up with a hypothesis.

We predict that Borderlands 3 will reveal the secrets behind the telekinetic alien of the pre-sequal (with a hint of Australian pride). We believe that they are part of species created from the vault. In addition, sirens are people who are vessals of vault energy that could've mutated their parents (similar to radiation causing people's offspring developing deformities). Or... Or, the Sirens are a sub-species/hybrid of the vault aliens, like a mule or tiger-lion. (Unlikely, as I don't think Jack would be open to that idea)

Evidence;

- The protectors of the vault in the pre-sequal have an almost identical design to the alien except of their mask which is probably used to categorised which vault they're assigned to.

- Both the protectors and sirens are both affected by eridium with an increase in power.

- If the Sirens' powers are created from radiation, then that energy has to be generated from somewhere. We think the Eridium is radioactive with it's purple glow. 
                  -----In addition to the other evidence, Angel was a powerful enough to control all of Hyperion technology. If Handsome Jack had a large sum Eridium, Angel would have developed the abilities from the radiation.

We hope you have the best of luck unpacking this theory. We had a lot of fun discussing this idea.

May many more theories come
- Jac. A. Cameron


(PS. That's my signoff, fyi)
¬¥#wtf
#BENLCE  .... how do i even say that... Lol.
Oh I will show you a bigger target!
#teambendy because why wouldn't you want to rip off the heads of the projectionists
Chris with the sass at the beginning
4:22 
That really hit me, cuz I just went to my 8th grade formal yesterday. Man was that fun... shouting the whole night... doing bets... doing cringe fortnite dances even though I don't like fortnite and have never liked it... watching my friend vomit in the bathroom while he's claiming he isn't on anything...
Literally walked outta their with about $20 more than I entered with (I entered with $0). 
My personal favorite bet was "go slow dance with this girl".
She wasn't even ugly. In fact, i asked the same friend who had bet me to dance with her to help introduce me... oh... I just realized what he did... well, let's hope her boyfriend doesn't learn about how i slow danced with his girl and called her cute... 
Sorry for rambling. I just had so much fun.
can we take a moment and realize how much time and effort is spent into this? the amount of time and effort that is put into these videos really shows how much the team and matpat truly care about the content.
Demonüòà or angelüòá
Bad acting.exe has stopped working
What if it is the butcher gang who are talking
6:46 Matt you better watch out behind you
I know this is unrelated but check petscope it has many new eps
Sees an 18 minute GT video

Me: Oh shi# here we go again.





*Fnaf flashback
the green screen format is pretty cool, I like it
What if bendy and alice had a child
Who‚Äôs side is the Projectionist on?
It‚Äôs. Boris he was made of the dark black ink he and Alison died Alice is an angel she would be considered light Boris was never considered light or dark Boris is going to reawaken and try to get revenge on bendy align yourself with Bendy and Boris will kill you align yourself with Alice you‚Äôll live just a thought
‚ÄúBut one thing always remains, the choices you make.‚Äù
(LiS fans screeching)
I just thought of something since you brought up FNAF. The original 4 animatronics are in the back room of FNAF 2 along with golden Freddy/ Fredbear, but where is Springbonnie?
When you need social media, hundreds of hours of research, and countless OTHER PEOPLE to explain your story. You have a bad story.
Whatever happened to the second ARG
team edward
Ever since you talked about it, I‚Äôve kept noticing all your lampshading.
Listening to matpat rant in a showe
usually when I watch your videos I get a headache from all the words but this just made me dizzy....I might have to take time away from the laptop
The voice is b-b-b-bendy hes was no voice in the end  SAMMY
I felt like the story was done better in Oxenfree. So, I hope that the next game really shakes things up, since I couldn't help but compare the two games when seeing them all the way through.
At 6:50 you can see bendy behind matpat :O
did anyone else have a mini heart attack in the beginning or was that just me
I love your editors^^
That ending was pure gold!
I'm team Boris.
I have a theory alice angel tortured the other ink monsters so and bendybwas one of them and the ink monsters when they were human they picked alice but alice betrayed them so the beytrayed people went to bendys side so if you pick bendy it might change
I Like Your New Style.
Of the game
Sammy: Hi Senpai! I love you! :3
Bendy: Leave me alone Sammy I hate you. * Walks away *
Sammy: BETRAYED, ABANDONED!!!!
Their hiding more things than Scott (Idk how to spell his last name but he's the creator of fnaf)
6:51. Not sure if you‚Äôre trying to send a subliminal message with a figure in the background or give me nightmares Mat üòÇ
I‚Äôm going with bendy
petscop when?
Yo MatPat i just wanna say....
there are 2 matpats at 5:27
Mat please do more petscop
Why Austin is a better host 0:05
Wtf, This is so crazy. But I love it.

We all know this is the reason why we go to school
#Team Angel
please like for a mega bendy dounut






:)
I knew sammy didnt die really his scream was a falling scream not a eating scream
6:50 Hello lost one!
I love watching game theory
Do more fnaf because the trailer of the game came out a long time ago
Why is no one asking where's the zoo level explanation we were promised
6:23 slow the video down and you can see something in the dark behind matpat in the doorway, pretty sure and at 6:51 you can see it when you pause might just be a coincidence or odd occurance
At the end of Chapter 5 of BATIM, the girl says ‚ÄúTell me another story Uncle Joey‚Äù. So does that mean that Bendy And The Dark Revival is Joey‚Äôs story...?
I mean call of duty did the same thing sorry for misspelling
What is in the background of 6:49 behind mattpat?
I‚Äôm just going to say this right now, holy moly that editing and new style is amazing I just wanted to tell you how much we all appreciate how much you put Into these videos, the research, the recording, the editing thank you Matt for just being amazing and doing all this work for us we all love you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
WAIT BIJUU MIJUU????
Twist: its another fnaf theory video
Maybe it‚Äôs an alternative universe yea
PATTHEW MATRICK I had to do it.I just had to
Teacher: does any of you know who's the smartest people on history?
Me:*points at matpat*
Bendy is the new FNAF
this reminds me of undertale
Make another persona theory plz
I can‚Äôt help but cringe at the green screen bits
Petscope has new videos you know what needs to be done
Go for a smaller target: between the legs lol
never mind
what happend to benby eyes
ALL HAIL THE WATCHER
next theory will be petscop, he released 4 episodes, just today, nope now it are 5
We all just witnessed a murderer
0:25  all this ally business stuff is really starting to get to matpat
Are you ever going to edit your self talking again
hiiii miiiike
Sammy and the Lost Ones

Sounds like a Emo band I used to listen too
6:23 DA HORD OF DA BUCKING BUCHER GANG
So heres the thing MattPat I need you to restock your backpacks so my sister can have the surprise of her life sometime between her birthday and the start of the school year in August so i can get it for her üò°
4:40 what happened to your vpice
oh I will show you a bigger target
I wish u still did your videos the same as before (but it's still good)
6:50 hey look! an easter egg!
Why did matpat change his format
Angle team
What is the butcher gang what is one person and got punished so they work together
6:51
Is it just me, or is there a person behind Matpat
I just noticed that some of the messages on the wall are clean and some are messy. The way they appear is like call and response.
I'm pretty sure that the reason the butcher gang are like that is because they are failed Alice's
God dammit I cried when it ended then I found out it‚Äôs no over
Are you odd1sout?
6:55
Of course the people who made this game just copied that from Gordon Ramsey‚Äôs Hell‚Äôs Kitchen
I wonder how often game devs watch these videos and think ‚Äúdammit! Why didn‚Äôt we think of that!?‚Äù
Ahh now i understand  now
I like the voice overs better
6:49 anyone else notice those eyes coming up behind matpat?
This game is back???

Like if you're excited!
new mic?
I will show you bigger target
6:45 right corner meatly?
Im on team angel
Love the new editing style. It still feels like Game Theory but it adds something new. Great job editors
r.i.p other guy 0:23
Is ThIs UndERtAlE
I just love how Mark was just like ‚ÄúOh OK‚Äù at Sammy coming back when everyone else was like ‚ÄúWTF HE DIED THE WORLD HAS ENDED‚Äù
THESE THEORIES ARE EPICCC
Who else loves when Matt patt starts to talk after something creepy happens?üòÇüòÇ
it is not a lense of truth, it is called the seeing tool
How do I sign up?
Am I the only one who thought matpat would say "will be in the next episode" at 8:06
But hey that‚Äôs just a theory
i have a idea since thenew game is not a prequel or sequel, its the beta/alpha versions such as beta sammy andalpha bendy ( maybe the bendy with the cut face with teathof your nightmares) its a new game idea but with alpha / beta characters. thats m ytheory
Oh god not all this again.
Observer is Henry or Joey
4 14 is my b day
Title: Bendy is not over

Me: Matpat‚Äôs fans are still fighting for a Coke Cola to sponsor you is not ALSO over
Ehhh I‚Äôm thinking that the mysterious voice is the puppeteer shown in a trailer for the western esc game. Tell me what you think.
Miss old vids..... with more editing less face..... no offense
Now we need Joey Drew studios and Scott cawthon to get together and make a game wouldn't that be fun
Benny6
Kinda miss how you use to just put your face on a picture it was funnyüòîüòî
I‚Äôm living this new style of theories! How it shows MatPat instead of just his voiceover! It‚Äôs more work but it seems really worth it
I don't really get what he means by "noisy". Idk that whole explanation just seemed kinda rushed to me,its probably because im stupid but if someone can explain to me what he means by bendy is a "noisy" game, other than it being loud of course then that would help a lot.
Yay fnaf in a bandy video I love it so much I want to kill it like my dad purple guy ~from luna the bunny aka luna afton
IOW MatPat‚Äôs explanation on the Butcher Gang is that they were corrupted when they were human like Susie was hence why they are being punished by the Ink Machine
Me: I wonder what bacon soup tastes like

Also me: 



I‚Äôd rather not be sick
(Edit: 54 likes. Ty so much üò≠)
11:51 when they say  " SECRET" he put it on a gold color  as well with "BEING WATCHED"  then he says that when he says demons and angels henry refers to Alice Angel and Bendy and on chapter five when you're on the  prison Thomas is watching you and if you put the two gold parts of the message it says secret being watched and if you see the part when he refers to the butcher gang there's a lot of Bori's bodies everywhere 15:56 as well Boris is only used for experiments being tortured he's one of the three more important characters of joey Drew Studios you can know that because Henry the creator of Bendy feels guilty when he couldn't save him on chapter 3, after all, there's posters of Alice Bendy and Boris all over the five chapters (i guess I don't remember that well) so putting all this parts together Henry talks about Bendy,Alice and all of the ink monsters there (including butcher gang, Sammy Lawrence,etc) but he never refers to boris the character tortured on chapter 3 so if the body of boris persisted on chapter 3 this means he had a soul so let's see he's a forgotten character that has been tortured by Alice and Bendy never helped him there's a 414th loop in which Henry tries to help him and fails Henry kills him on the ending of Chapter 4  he's kinda like the butcher gang  but on the cutscene of     when you chose the demon side you can see that bendy is leading the searchers and butcher gang monsters but Boris isnt there right? after all, Alice tortures him 414th times on this loop so if you count that Thomas on chapter 5 is actually a Boris it makes more sense when he doesn't trust on you after all you never save him but even though he helps you after all meaning he's someone that always forgives people (even though you kill him on chapter 4 :/   )
so he could be manipulated but be broken at the same time changing his personality as on Thomas case so this could mean that Boris could be someone very important on the Bendy and the Dark Revival new game  meaning this could be a side story or explaining what Boris did all this time on Joey Drew Studios maybe he could be responsible for a lot of things happening in the game  because we never see a lot of his backstory more than Alice torturing him he only see him as a toy so this game could reveal something about Boris but that is just my theory,
still, if you have something on mind to complete this theory or discard in you can reply this and thank you if you read this bunch of letters I hope you like it,
 and please if you want to criticize try to make a constructive critic and don't be just mean or something.
Btw I know that a lot of you won't be on agree with my theory or say that this whole thing is just a waste of time but sometimes people need to be:


PUN-ished

a nice joke to set the mood   ;)
'K Bye
Relate the two shadow people from five nights at Freddy's 2 to the new two technicians
7:48 i dont get it...
MatPat, I demand more dad jokes!
The editing is flawless, brilliant work lokking forward to the next ep
P.s petscop plz
8:21 jeez throw some shots out ay?
Does the ink change anytime after u go thought again
...Or it was a Story for a little girl
8:10  so it took half of the video to get to the qestion?
Scott: I got a game in the most popular console, ps4.
TheMeatly: Atleast I'll make a game supported in all devices.
Mat: Welp, more theories, more content.
from batim too batdr
Why is this close to deltarune?
I came back to this video if there is a demon and an angle in the middle purgatory so this person will most likely be undead from purgatory just take it in to questioning please
Yesssss
Scott: brings back fnaf
Toby: brings back Deltarune
Paul: brings back petscop
Meatly: revives bendy

Mat: What's up demons, It's ya boi!
That opener was so funny
Good theory MatPat!
Can you do one on Baldi‚Äôs Basics in Education and Learning?
Turn it backkk
0:25 I think I headed a moan
Mat pat:Bendy and the shot in the dark

Also mat pat:that was a terrible joke 

Me: 
why would anyone be working on some ink machine during 1940-1943? don't they have, I don't know, NAZIS to worry about? just blows my mind this sort of future age soul tech isn't being put into war time use but instead in some private animation studio that should be pumping out anti-nazi propaganda
Was the start with hitting matpat skripted or unplanned
Bjui mikey
The new voice is MatPat!
6:44 look closely. You'll see themeatly
The tommy gun is .....someones
Wow good start
I hate looking at the butcher gang, their designs make me feel so sad for some reason.
Okay this new-ish format is the best decision this channel has made since starting film theory tbh
Soo... can it be a midquel?
@6:50 You might want to run. Anyway, interesting thing about the Loop, at the end of Chapter 5 Joey mentioned something akin to "You know how you always pushed me to do better... Maybe you should've pushed a little harder", perhaps he's signaling to you that he wants you to save him from making these mistakes so he keeps sending you back in time to break the loop.
Gotta love the use of FNaF.
I know it's a little late and you probably won't read this.......BUT anyways. Remember the Super Mario Builder video you did, I was wandering how many possibilities are there in human fall flat for the Nintendo Switch.
I'm one of the$≈£√¶ff
What do you think about showdown bandit?
I love that MatPat has been actually in the videos so much lately. It makes me happy.
I have some theories
ok but mad props to the editors of Game Theory!
"i'll show you a bigger target"
BREAKING NEWS: THIS MORNING AT THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Mat the voice could be a human bendy monster
Love the intro üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§
Your head is a bigger target 
As he whoever said that.
Oh I‚Äôll show you who a bigger target. As mad pat said and going to killl him
If bendy really is teammates with the butcher gang then how come once they go next to each other bendy kills them?
"I WILL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET" -Matthew Patrick, the funniest youtuber ever
Bendy 2: civil war
I miss when matpat‚Äôs theories would not involve his entire bidy and just a bunch of cleverly edited pictures and videos and sometimes memes
#TeamDemon
For the butcher gang
#TEAMBENDY
MatPat do a Sekiro theory!!!
The intro is everything
I miss the old vids before reallife matpat
Matpat can you do my math homework
With MatPat standing in front of the gameplay, I feel like it's WeatherMan MatPat. "and over here we have a high of 32 degrees and a chance of risk of rain, but remember that's just a theory, a game theory. Now back to your regularly scheduled broadcast"
OK Mr.MatPat this has been a question that's been on my brain for a while. What is the psychology of people who pick support in class based games. Playing these games (TF2 Overwatch ect.) You see a lot of jokes where most people refuse to play that class. Any reason why?
Matpat: Oh I will show you a bigger target
Me: ASSULT??? ANYONE???
Matpat using the regular intro and not the 1920s intro is cruel.
MatPat... "Bendy 2", you dont want the HeartBound polemic happening again right?
Did you notice that there also is 1440 audio clips? You mentioned that in your last BATIM theory
After i watch this i feel dum
The voice in bendy 2 video it was sammy sammy is alive all my thioris it leads to sammy
Queue the montage.
Markiplier: ‚Äúoh ok‚Äù
Everyone else: freaks out
In the intro Matt pad is me with my friends
MATPAT I enjoy the OLD style of your videos.
we are picking sides.
#TeamBendy
I feel bad for the guy in the intro
Who came here from Bijuu Mike's video?
Sadly he forgot about henry's little character
8:40 it‚Äôs kinda like in hello neighbour with hide and seek
Imagine if Bendy and Fnaf had a crossover.
I still prefer the old format.
In Chapter four ink things where you have to get a ink blob end sammy‚Äôs masks thats for the secret in chapter five ink sammy
#teamdemon
The gun is probably is that guy gun
Mat why do live action in game theory and not in film theory?
Move aside bendy theory... Petscop theory is coming!
8:08 "thats the question today"
Lol thought id hear that earlier in the video
MatPat: WE DONE FINALLY.

BATIM: Hold my soup...
The funny thing about the thumbnail is the fact that they are made of ink so how are they being erased? XD
Bendy or Alice? 
Me: both! I know i can't choose both but i can't decide for One XD 
Rlly?
Me: im Sorry i just Ship them √íw√ì
HEY MATPAT WHY DON'T  you start a new channel which is called war theory??? It would be very nice i bet pls many war theory's will be discovered pls
So either way Bendy's back
MatPat: a clip of bijuu Mike
Bijuu Mike:makes a vidio abaut it
What if like when Henry fell and progresses to the exit
Someone entered the Studio maybe it's still the game But a different angle or character maybe when Henry met Alice and Tom
Someone fell too Maybe there are different Holes in the workshop And he got there by Making a platform to cross just maybe
could henry be the one that's trying to fix it
I know why bendy hates alice becuase alice is killing boris
so is bendy using the deltarune premise
Matpats now a weather reporter üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
6:51 figure behind matpat
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I personally prefer the animated style of GT from back in and around 2013. The new writing is far superior though.
Im Already On t#teamangels
I genuinely think this is an ad for ‚ÄòBendy and the Dark Revival‚Äô
Nobody is technically able to have watched this video to the end yet.

That means I‚Äôm early
YESSSSSS he noticed the trailer for ‚ÄúBendy And The Dark Revival‚Äù
If it‚Äôs not a sequel or a prequel what happens if we play as bendy or Alice?
Notice that Henry makes mention of Monsters aka the third/middle tribe so will the monster path be hidden?
Also please do pet scop
Wouldn't it be cool if you played as Sammy in BENDY and the Dark Revival
I loved you üò≠ you were the best. Now
Your the most cringe YouTuber alive And I‚Äôm not a hater just stop trying to put in every single joke you think of In the video only keep
The ones that are funny
Ya know

1:30 am, in a large open beach house, across the country from home while I'm on caffeine is not a good place to watch this.

...guess who ran to the bedroom trying not to have a legit heart attack
What if the game is from the Butcher Gangs pov?
Someone: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre head‚Äôs a bigger target‚Äù

Mat: ‚ÄúOH ILL SHOW U A BIGGER TARGET‚Äù
Bijuu mike had just reacted to this :-:
BIJUU BIKE!!!!
1 story, 2 perspectives.
6:50 tell me im not insane
Who misses old Game Theory
my eyes have been enlightened-
Petscop 4
When you try to seriously say SHOOKETH 




I died ( like if you did too)
new petscop episodes have entered the chat
Bendy creators are trying to become the new fnaf for matpat
Maybe Joey is the watcher.
I miss cut out MatPat.
8:58 or the story continues call if duty did the same thing for modern warfare 3 which take place just after the events of modern warfare 2 it don't have to be a sequel
the connection between the tally marks and the trailer dates blew my mind. honestly it was so cool!
Ok Can We Get A side?
#ok#
I'm not sure I like this whole... "see Matt through the entire video" thing. I miss the photoshop cut-outs and quick editing.
'We Were Wrong'
Not, fuckface, YOU were wrong.
It's only 'We' when you're talking about mistakes and fuckups.
I see you.
if you have the captions on when mat claps his hands it says *meme review" haha
So you're saying it's a sequel loop pre after alternate timeline? (Like Deltarune‚Ä¶) Yeah, umm...
12:45 I thought you were going to say ‚ÄúBendy is learning to Read‚Äù or something like that because of the R, E, and A you showed
Can someone make a "vote #teambendy" and a "vote #teamalice" shirts?? That would be beautiful
1:55, Bijuu Mike made a new video on you
Are you afraid of God?
No but I'm afraid of you
What is new bendy game!??!!
could you do a theory on the cool indie game, yandere simulator ?
Hey can you guys cover the lore of hollow knight
i loved that intro lmao
Oh god I already see the fan art.
Did you go to Harvard because you the only smart YouTuber I watch
Matpat petscop ONLY PETSCOP WE NEED IT
So Matt,is it just cheaper for you to be on camera? Because I really miss that still version of you.
Did anyone else see the creepy guy in the background at 6:51?
9:49 Lol, American's, amirite? 


Even the editor saw how totally unintuitive, insular and frankly ridiculous this is and looks but went 'alright this is the mess we live in' let's draw a 4 below the 14, and a 4 below April (Consecutively the 4th month of the year). It doesn't make sense, but we're AMERICANS! FU(K YEAH!
Please do the new petscop videos!!!!!
Still loving this new theory format its better than a cut out i feels....personal like im theorizing WITH you. Keep up the good work üëç üëç two thumbs up!
Somebody :ur heads a bigger target

Mat :oh I'LL SHOW U A BIGGER Target 

Somebody:uah!!
This is actually so much to take in.... I freaking LOVE it!!!!!
That ending tho 
mat casually gets thrown away
Wow took you long enough to show me how its all linked to fnaf.
Wait 







THE TEASER WAS RELEASED ON MY BIRTHDAY? 
Matt "Oh I'll show you a bigger target"




( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
18:14 Well, I guess that sums up what the editors think of MatPat
I'm not a big fan of this new theme I miss the old.
6:50 LOOK OUT MATPAT
i am not the only one to see the figure next to mat at 6:50 right
# Team Angel
matpat I miss your talking jpeg
The w.d in w.d gaster stands white dog
Did anyone else notice the thing at 6:50?
Voice sink is off
THERE ARE 5 NEW PETSCOP VIDEOS OUT
Plot twist: Henry from Bendy and the Ink Machine is Henry from FNAF!
I like the new editing style
Also can u do a theory on oxenfree
Anybody else prefer it when matpat used more animations and graphics then when he talks to the camera?
Nobody:
Petscop: uploads 5 videos within 24 hours
Bijuu mike was on there that's really cool
Or maybe, the Dark Revival is taking place during the first 5 chapters.
That would be interesting.
* I prepare to build my tf2 sentry‚Äôs *
I serve the angels.
ü§Ø WoW üò≤ 
I‚Äôm just lost of words right now. 
Please keep doing great theories in all games.
For me, I love theories and back stories on the games I watch and used to play. 
Big bear üêª hugs ü§ó 
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è Mat
Any possibility for a DOTA 2 theory about whatsoever?
Can I say that I really love your intro? I love how it was simply just Mario with 8-bit music in the background and now it's so cool!
0:57 you always need to keep your hopes high for the things you don't think about. This is coming from someone overlooked constantly.
As excited as I am about BATDR, I'm sure you noticed the new petscop videos from a couple days ago! Please give us more petscop theories!
14:30 - I love the Butcher Gang too. I mean, what happened to them?
You know the Creator of the Bendy and the ink machine Right?, Well if you do can you tell him to put my Oc in the game Pleasee it all I want in life.Thanks!!
I will be in bendys side not Alice angel
April,14 that‚Äôs my birthday
Nice intro LOL
NOOOOOOOOO :0 i thought this was over... honey, quick get the shot gun
LOL I WS CRYING AT THAT INTRO XD
I know you probably don't take theory suggestions but I really think you should do another Hello Neighbor theory. The story that is spread throughout this franchise is incredibly interesting. I cried so many times while "interacting" with the games and books. There are a lot of clues that come with the prequel books that help understand the game's story but it just doesn't cut it, it just still feels like there is something missing. And I know your the only one who can explain the timeline and the missing clues of the Hello Neighbor world.

I love the editing of these new videos man! Keep it up guys
414
American: oh, 14th of April...
British: there is no 14th month!!!








(our dates are different to Americans if you were confused, for us it would be 14/4 rather than 4/14)
If Alice is made of ink how is Bendy erasing her with an eraser? ü§î
Everyone: 

Matpat: 
Thank you for the excellent theory and I really appreciate your hard work, I am serious it must take a while to do that type of thinking
#TeamBendy since chapter 1 üòà
Down vote because im tired of seeing ur face. I prefered still shot editing and cut out style u had before
Probably my favorite Game Theory intro to date.
My theory is that we're going to play as Linda
That intro tho üòÇüòÇ i love it so much
I must‚Äôve missed the explanation, but how come MatPat‚Äôs doing this format now?
1 / 14 is my birth day
Matpat do a theory on is lefty nightmare look back on lefty an then look back at nightmare
shookith
The 'Observer' is obviously Micky Mouse duh.
Hey guys thanks for lifting me up with your awesome videos :)
Next episode: DDLC 2! THE SECRET ABOUT LIBITINA
6:50 who else saw the ink behind him
The Beginning made me laugh!! üòÇ Also, I love your theories!
and the new splatoon splatfest will be....





Team Bendy vs Team Alice!!
FNaF, Bendy, Petscop... seems like MatPat has alot of horror genre targets reappearing
#Angels
8 minutes in: And that's our theory. What was all that nonsense at the start then?
I think Sammy is talking or warning bendy that someone has reawakened the dark
you did not disappear into ink you were thrown into a bin.


Also when he brought up all the Sammy stuff I got vibes of the song 'Can I Get an Amen' by CG5 lol.
It took you 8 minutes to tell us the question 8:01
That intro was hilarious. Please do more like that.
Yo maybe do is it possible for humans to be super human just like alex mercer
I swear if the YOU, THE PLAYER is the one who's always watching, this will give me Doki Doki Literature Club vibes, this 4th wall breaking will give me nightmares again.
If the theories are true, and we can pick a side...




Sorry Alice, I‚Äôm on the 
Petscop comes out with 5 episodes  






Mattpatt: noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
#teambendy
It was before my birthday?!?! What the flip?!

Anyways great theory
MatPat
There was hashtag
It said NotBATIM
HEEEEELLLLPPPPP
X3
I watched DDLC on GTLive, then looked for mods of the game and found Bijuu Mike, which bounced me back to Game Theory because I saw that he was featured in this video. ü§î Funny how life works...
hAsHtAg TeAm AngLe ( I spelled it wrong on purpose)
#team bendy defeat Alice we the bendy people shall  win thus war
no more fanf !!!!!!!!
Can you do a video on Very Little Nightmares? I found the trailer very interesting and I enjoy seeing this type of story theorizing. Thanks
8 minutes into video and finally starts talking about the game in the video title
It‚Äôs been a year since I once watched one of your videos
Sammy used the pump thingy to revive
Its another pre-sequel like Borderlands!  üò±üò±
Love your vids
Or matpat it cood just be an remake with new stuff
The intro is awesome 
üòÇüòÇ
‚ÄúYour head is a bigger target‚Äù
strong video today guys! great work, makes me really excited to see where bendy will take us, can't wait!
My birthday is 4/14.
Just saying.
Fnaf: we have the most confusing plot
Batim: hold my beer
Bendy and the ink machine: Civil War
Hey remember that duck season Video at the end MatPat is stuck in the Video well.... MATPAT IS STUCK IN BENDYS STUDIO 0:25
OH I WILL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
I came here from Bijuu Mike's channel. He was so thrilled to be featured that he made a video on it  and claimed to be MatPat's best friend xd. But in all seriousness it was really neat to see.
Yo Henry fell like 3 times in the game right? So if he went through the studio 414 times he fell like 1,242 timesüòÇüòÇ

414 x 3= 1,242
AYYYYYY it's a scrub in its natural habitat. 

cough bijuu mike  cough
Bendy and the ink machine.....how about.....bendy and the meme machine? ;)
10:34
Bruh, this sounds like a really old Disney character.
Bendy and the Ink Machine: Civil War
Just want to say, I really love your videos and theories, I can never stop watching them all once I have one going
#AliceAngel
Even thought I'm not an angel lol
MatPat please can you play Fran Bow live?!?!
I'm late but I just realized something about the in-game Butcher Gang. They seem to have the See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil motif going on.
SHOOKETH
What 3rd pokemon starter in pokemon let's go pikachu
hey like i dont watch game theory any more but i came to comment because of the thumbnail. you cant use a pencil eraser to erase INK. 

one day this channel will be the death of me.
Nice theory! I really liked it!
Bijuu mike fan yeeet
sees that bijuu plays bendy and I didn't know it

Sorry PatMat, I have to go watch that video.
Lmao the Trailer came out on my birthday and I feel special now
MatPat: "I'll show you a bigger target!"

me: what does that even mean? XD
I'm so team Bendy. Alice shouldn't have messed with Boris!
Sammy sounds like a 15 year old üòÇ
Matpat: mike is like scott.
Mike: you found the truth..........*pulls off mask*
Matpat: GASP
mike is confusing as Scott mike is scott
I know this is off topic but..





Im watching bob Ross after this _( _ ‚Äò-‚Äò )-‚òïÔ∏è 
I'm glad that we get this kind of vid and than the funny edits were it's just his voice,I love this set up,love ya Matpatüíô
The outro of this should be the normal outro. LOLOL
im drawing bendy , alice , boris, sammy, reanimted bendy
17:55 that Tommy gun belong to Tommy Lawrence
Wow technology yay technology
7:50 MatPat, you've already started with the dad jokes. That's your life now.
Aye Bijuu mike I found him when you started doki doki
this just came to mind. Remember one of your deadpool eps that you said you wish you have super human healing and look ulgy because you don't have to show your face on youtube...


NOW LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!
(don't hate it just meme)
What happened to Accounting+? It's been 23 videos, and no news about the game for a few months. I think we deserve another episode after that "We found the zoo level" comment you left on the last one.
The intro tho is me when I am presenting with props
Hey april 14th is my birthday. Why did i feel the need to share this?
That intro was everything
#teamdemon
OMG BIJUU MILK, DAWKO, MARKY MOO, JACKSEPTICEYE, YAY!!
i think i will be on the bendy side because i want to be friends with the butcher gang and see them up close and bendy too, bendy looks kinda cool
Hey matpat or austin or anyone who works here I know you may be already talking and recording other video but recently there have been sone reports about the abuse on fortnite workers 

Acording to them they worked from 70 to 100 hours weekly 

I am sorry I only found a article thats on spanish but is a verry well detailed one 

Also if anyone knows someone who would be able to talk about this PLEASE ask them to do it 

I hope that it all goes all well 

Me
Who else came here from Bijuu Mike?
So rather than it being a sequel or a prequel, it's a story within a story.
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D
Great intro HA HA IM STILL LAUGHING üòÜü§£üòÇ
I was wondering if you could do how fast is Jin from xenoblade chronicle 2, I believe he is as fast as sonic or goku since he can disappear from his speed
I thought we were done.
Nope nevermind ;-; .
Alice with Hylian shield XD
bendy got a team so ya #teambendy
It‚Äôs a bird!
No, a plane!
NO ITS MATPAT!
intro plays
Game Theory: Boris is Alice's dad
Yeah, MatPat is getting a lot of Scott Cawthon pulled into him
I don't care #teamBendy
Hey matpat I made a theory for Borderlands can you please let me know if I am right?
No entiendo nada :,v
MatPat: You were supposed to through it at my hand!
Guy behind the scenes: your head was a bigger taget lol
MatPat: I'LL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET!!
Guy behind the scenes: NONONONO!!!!
Me: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
To be honest I like the old style :/
What in the world hits matpat's head at the beginning. (before the plunger)
Not ink but into a trash can
Everyone: omg bendy 2!!!!!!!1!1)!!!!
Me, an intellectual: MatPat said "shooketh"
To be honest, I like your old cardboard cutouts style of editing more than real person gesturing things to me.
Matpat: thinks he finishes Bendy
New Bendy: i‚Äôm back bois
Matpat: Am I a joke to you?
MatPat: You're supposed to throw it at my hand 
Random dude: You're head is a bigger target 
MatPat: OH I'll show you a bigger target  
Me: ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Matpat: Finally no more fnaf or Bendy theories


Soctt and meatly:mmmmmmmm
N O P E  hehe

Therapist: OH GOD
Bendy and the ink machine is Batim

So Bendy and the dark revival is Batdr


Batdr???
i think bendy and the ink is gonna end up like fnaf... 




50 years later --> bendy and the ink machine 25... matpat theorizing at age 82
The demon route was harder (i didn't know that) but i never encountered bendy because i never EVER stayed out for too long wow
I think being on Team Bendy would be most revealing.
Hey mat, since Joker from Persona 5 came to smash ultimate could yo udo a Persona theory?
Sammy Lawrence sounds like Joseph seed from far cry 5
I‚Äôll show you a bigger target Ni-
‚ÄúOh I will show you a bigger target‚Äù
Mmmmmmmmmm not sounds wrong so very wrong
Okay Matt I like the new style but you could improve the mike audio a little bit
I think i figured out what the grave in the back in the picture with the gravestones I think its Michael afton
I think the game is an alternative universe. But I‚Äôm not completely sure about my decision.
Maybe the butcher gang members that were human were the employees Wally refered to in (I think chapter 3?) During the time you're in bendy land there is an audio log were Wally mentions that employees keep coming and playing the games in bendy land  and that he has to clean up after them, maybe those humans are being punished for their bad behavior.
That intro
Saying that you underestimated BATIM is an UNDERSTATEMENT. You joked about it being a FNAF clone, you joked about it having so much in common with FNAF when it's in A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN! The fact that TheMeatly gave you access to it early AT ALL is a miracle.


MatPat, I love your theory videos and I love you and Steph as people. But I've ALWAYS thought the way you treated BATIM was unfair to the series, to its creators, and to its fans. I'm glad you've decided to look at this game with a new light and new respect for the series. Thank you.


Edit: I'm surprised you don't know about ProdCharles, a PROLIFIC BATIM theorist.
Guess who's back, back again...Bendy and Freddy are back....Tell MatPat
"Bendy`s Inkdrop Distance"



HahahaüòùüòÇ
Who‚Äôs your fave Bendy character?
Alice
Bendy
Boris
Sammy
Bertrum 
Thomas
Wally
Henry
Joey
Butcher gang characters
Allison
Ink Bendy
My fave is Alice!
2 views, 400 non-existing comments. Wow.
And now my likes aren't working. GrEAt eASTeR
Can you PLEASE do another theory on Poppy? She really turning her type of content around to a very dark place, I think it would be very interesting to hear from you!
Love the red jacket
Bring animated MatPat back! That's funnier and better in my opinion
#TeamBendy bc i'm mad that Alice killed Boris >:(
Plus the chain part of the trailer came from bendy king chair you know how in the edge of bendy king chair there chain so probably that part it shows us how bendy king chair would look like
I never saw anything about the new bandy game! ;(
these type of horror game theorys get me freaked out but i like that 


for some reason
It could be a dream or flashback?
6:49 Uhhhh.... Matpat what is behind you? Look behind you.... I'm scared now
hey matpat remember petscop theres more vids can u do more theorys on it pls
"Your head's a bigger target"
I just now thought of this: what if the hands and shaking room in Chapter 4 is the work of Thehe Observer turning the Ink Machine back on? What if the someone from Butcher Gang is the who turned it on, and Joey made that it clear was Fisher was who lied to him to protect the others? I may be wrong, but it seems to make sense. The loop is random and unpredictable at points because of The Observer, or Observers.
I am also a fellow theorists
Mat pat makes alot of good intros.
Oh, man, I can't wait for Bendy: Civil War!
8 minute intro. 



I blame T-Series
MatPat Do the next theory on the plot of Katan ZERO

Guys like this comment to let MatPat see it
Can you please talk about Petscop in the next vid? We're all confused and need your help to understand wtf is going on!!!
What if in the new game you play as Sammy and you start the loop doing rituals to summon the demon and makes a deal with it only for it to backfire 
-(.-.)- meh?
You didn't do the theory about octodad
Matpat great news posted several episodes at once.
Here's an interesting theory could fnaf vr game that is coming soon possibly be a parallel universe of the fnaf franchise.(or a side story who knows)
But what's interesting is that  while looking at the franchise there are different story of fnaf. For example steam games fnaf 1-6 focus the story on Micheal Afton and William Afton, in UCN it focus on William Afton in purgatory and in the books( which I did'nt find the inspiration/motivation  to read and also the internet and wikia is a thing.) it focuses on  Charlie. But not only that I found it a bit interesting that the books were parallel and not canon to the steam game. So in conclusion could this Playstation fnaf vr game be a parallel universe to the fnaf franchise? probably not but it is good to wonder about these things when you have free time.
The reason I bring up parallel universes is because i have been noticing that games are starting to do parallel universe story like undertale/deltarune or  possibly Bendy basically a not a sequel / not a prequel scenario
All of the ‚ÄúEvil characters‚Äù seem to be copies like the Alice Angel that tries to be perfect. But the ‚Äúgood characters‚Äù tend to be the real deal. So is there a good bendy?
Don't you mean bendy and the ink heart hd ink drop distance 2.8 edition
They also all last year till now had Alice vs. Bendy questions
I was shook when I saw bijuu mike. My two favorite YouTubers are Matpat And bijuu mike. I. Am. Shookth.
at first I thought the mysterious person would be Joey Drew in human form, and they would show us more of him maybe before he's bendy or somethin, because we only know him as bendy and that was it.
Now i finally know what the latest message meant!
pretty good editing bro
#teamangel
Takes 8: minutes and 10 seconds to get to the point
Bijuu Mike was shook
I would be messed up if it's a presequal
Oooo... scatter plots.. shivers
Do a Pvz theory
Bijuu Mike finally got noticed by matpat, our theorist and yandere theorist had some interaction wow
I was just think of you making this video‚ù§Ô∏è
Bendy: New game
Layers Of Fear: New game
FNAF: New game
Why so many things with new games this year
Am I the only one who thinks this'll be, like, FNAF Saga: Part II

This anime is getting repetitive... LOL
I was wondering when you were gonna do this lmao
6:48 yooooo df is that in the door?
Hey MatPat! Is there anything new about the Portrait of Markov?
I don't know if you've seen this but One day I searched about Libitina and I found pictures of the girls being experimented on. And more pictures of Sayori being chained up and hugging her cow and one of her hands had cuts like Yuri. And I was wondering if you could make another theory... I'm just giving a suggestion...do whatever you want :3 :)
Tbh I found superhorro bro a better place to learn about bendy
Now that I watched this, I kinda feel bad for the Butcher Gang
Calling it now, the mysterious shadowy figure is actually... The Purple Guy.

Now before any one complains, I'm just having fun joking about what would admittedly be a pretty awesome crossover.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!! When he said ladies and gentlemen we are picking sides I had a fan girl moments
Team bendy for life
New format sicks
Props to ALL of the editors out there. Not even just on Game Theory, even though they are awesome and do so well on these videos. It takes so much time, work, and talent to edit videos, whether or not it be every day, for a big or small channel, or for a small project. Clap and a half to all the editors out there, you rock!!
BIJUU MIKE :D
Hey when you were behind the door their was something creeping behind you
Just a thought after mat said about the butcher gang being brutaled,tortured and hurt and the character in the bendy and the dark revival preview kind of looks like piper I thought probably those three had more in for them then everyone thought I think probably that the butcher gang this time will not be ignored this time maybe they will be the......AGATONGONIST's of bendy and the dark revival! for revenge (just saying think about it like rewind and listen to all of the part when starts talking about butcher gang it might give a clue).
If the butcher game is on bendy's side, then why in chapter 5 we are bendy killing some of them in the hiding mission to fix the pipes.
I love the 3D Game Theories personally, and that ending was pretty entertaining and would've been impossible without the physical you.
I think that the one who has reawaken the dark is henry.He is the one who turned the ink machine on again.
early gang
....so, sammy is gay?...
I‚Äôm with Angels you guys?
I miss the old matpat
8:45 no it's deltarune
-You're supposed to throw it at my hand!
-Your head was a bigger target.
-I SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET!


LOL
In 6:54 theres something behind him
Anyway I really want you to do a video about airmech arena theory not a lot knows w about the lore of the game (sorry about the spelling I'm 10)
Ha 
Inkdrop distance
time for petscop 5 lol
Oh god the trailer was uploaded on my birthday and I never heard of it until now... oops.
>Not a prequel


It's treason then.
Can we Continue that into I want to see matpat beat him up
I kinda like the new format, but the audio is something that you guys might want to work on. Slightly... for a lack of a better word; unnerving(?) to listen to a slightly off put audio key, compared to all the previous episodes. Keep up the good work, and nice theory! I'm not a Bendy fan, but I do enjoy your theories on the games!
Jeez They missed my birthday by 2 days April 12
0:24 R.I.P Chris. Press F to pay respects.
Great new start! #BlameJason
About 8 years after Bendy came out, another medium with a slightly-less-complicated lore makes their number 415.




Isn't that how counting important numbers in a work goes? 413, 414, 415?
I like this new format a lot
So, why is Mat doing live action now?
XD that ending though. Haha
Just a thought but when mat said that henry was referring to bendy and Alice after he said "demons and angels" but then mat ask "what is the thing?" I thought of something or someone and you know what I think I know what the "THING" is and the THING iiiiisss......Boris (note: this was just a joke I thought of due to mat didn't referred Boris to Henry's recording lines but hey can't leave the poor wolf out #hope Boris will return).
I loved that intro! Considerably less cringey than usual! üòÖ
Is it wrong I imagine Matpat sitting on the bruised and bleeding unconscious body of the guy who threw the plunger at him whenever he's offscreen?
0:26 that moan




Guess you can say he plunged him üòèüòâ
I'm early, I have an attack plunger to use. Wanna use the one with spikes or the one with a cat on it?
What if it is an overlap story, as in the events of BATiM take place during but this game starts before and ends after. And here is a theory the main character isn't Sammy but Joey Drew, or different chapters could be a different protagonist each to show different sides of the same events.
hey. Can you make a theory about a horror game called Shut Eye? (It's on the nintendo switch)
wait but you showed a voice record made by henry
how can we hear it, if henry is trapped?
maybe the new game will be someone coming to save henry from the studio?
The new style of video gives me hardcore Blues Clues vibes.
I love how noisy BATIM is, it makes the whole thing seem more real. Plus, there are so many little bits that "jumpscare" you and are a bit unsettling that just add to the atmosphere. BATDR is gonna be great!
Feels a bit awkward for you to show up on camera normally
Anyone else imagine Boris(Tom) with the tommy gun?
What time did i starts watching this video?
#TemBENDY!!!!!
I live the new style where we actually get to see Mat. And the editors do an amazing job. Just feels a bit more interactive (idk if that‚Äôs the right word) I guess. Just more fun to watch in general (don‚Äôt worry mat, I still love your old stuff)
PICK APART THE LOVE GOV VIDEOS
#teambendy
i think i know what bendy and the dark revival is o-o i have a theory who remembers the evil alice from chapter four WELL the audio clip was from alice so maybe they are bringing the evil ones back to life like sammy and the inky and evil alice
When your 8 minutes in and kinda bored and theres ten minutes left but your a loyal theorist
The way this video is done (how matpat is standing in front of the info) reminds me of Bill nye the science guy
What if the whole ink world is just on a piece of paper and you the artist get so into your work you get sucked in
This is a nice change to your formula. Having you on scren and actually interacting with me makes for a more entertaining video that captures my attention more. I feel more reason to actually watch the video, rather than just listen.
Mat took the plunge
Epic you went into a trash can üóë
I mean why make more theories about it if we really don't care for it that much anymore.
When it says someone has reawakened the dark could it be referring to when Henry reactivated the ink machine in Chapter One
I FRIGGIN SCREAMED AFTER 
‚ÄùCUE THE MONTAGE‚Äù
EDIT: 4/14! MY JAW DROPPED TO THE FLOOR! 
But great theory! This puts a new shade (see what I did there?) on everything!
MatPat has been added to Super Smash Bros
Everyone: What is his weapon?
Nintendo: A plunger
MatPat:Ladies and gentlemen we are picking sides
Me:I wanna be bendy
My friend:Im already bendy
Me:What about Alice angel
My friend:I'm already Alice angel
Me:What have I started
You got a like just for that intro. The whole video is awesome but, that intro had me laughing for a while.
Wow 8 minutes for the intro, nice!
The way Joey talks reminds me of Jalol from Fairytale, lol.
MatPat:*did a final ep about a fame*
Game creator:Hold whatever I was holding!
It will always be like this....Poor MatPat
WHERE'S TEH SUPERHORRORBRO SHOUTOUT, HE MAKES BENDY THEORIES!
5:11 R.I.P.   youtube video compression
i have only just realised it says the smaatest show in gaming 
i have been subbed for years
#TEAMBENDY!!!
Liked it better when Mat's person was NOT in the videos smh....
"jumpscare"
I love the new style but I will miss the stock photo of matpat
5:15, that meme has the Quickmeme watermark on it
What if it‚Äôs joey‚Äôs story??
I‚Äôm liking the new editing
5:16 way to ruin youtube's compression
Nice hidden meetly
Who else missing the old editing format
I got a ad saying "deja Vu"






The ad was right were going to literally destroy a guys mind Whit games non stop
Watch super horror bros
There bendy theories are pretty good
Bendy 2: Electric Boogaloo

Pls
April 14 ! that the date titanic sank in 1912 
lol
Best üëèüèΩintro üëèüèΩever
Thought we saw that stitching before with Alice's reanimated wolf character.
I really think that this new format where matpat shows his face is actually quite good. It gives the channel kinda more personal feel
#teamweenie
6:45 secret meatly found
Maybe they we're investers in the ink company and lied to Joey they want revenge against the company the Butter gang
Well I‚Äôm #bendy
Just me or is the audio a little weird? Like he's walking closer and further from the mic?
Petscop released like 4 videos today so .. hop on the hype train
Yeet I think the secret guy who is watching us, is Sammy. üòê Can't wait for the Dark Revival! üòÄ If it is a side story were we have to choose Angel side or Demon side, then its gonna be EPIC! ‚ù§
Great Theory Guys!!! ‚ù§
Expectation: Bendy and the Dark revival
Reality: Bendy telltale episode 1
00:25

Nobody:

Me: That‚Äôs what she said!!!!!
Matpat: Mentions Kingdom Hearts
Kingdom Hearts fandom: Okay, I believe you.
has anyone tried to lay out the building in Bendy?
That was my birthday!
Wonderful theory as always matpat!
Ever thought about taking a stab at the kingdom hearts 3 sleeping realm theory?
ya'll ready for another homestuck
413 & 414
sophisticated game like this exists
fnaf: *hold my f***ing beer.
That was the best editing I've seen so far, hot damn guys.
I miss Photoshop mattpat :(
* I love it when Matt says YouTube‚Äôs were shooketh
I am soo excited I love bendy üòÅüòÜüòÑüòÉüòÄ
My friends are gunna  be mad when they find out there's another bendy game
No editors have been hurt in the making of this video
Old style is better
Finally a new game theory video
6:46 look close in the door way u will see something....
You know what this game needs? A WARHAMMER CROSSOVER
INK FOR INK GOD
Also the idea of siding with bendy hel yeah 
#teambendy
Why do my nails break EVERY FRICKIN TIME I WATCH A THEORY
‚ÄúOH I WILL SHOW YOU A BIGGER TARGET‚Äù!
A Trash can, eh?
The Editors are getting Snarky.
I like how matpat is doing more things of him in real life instead of just a picture. Loved the video!!!!!!!!
YOOOO LOOK MA!! I made it into the cut üòÇüôåüèª thanks guys!
So its not:
Henry
Bendy
Alice
Evil Alice
Boris (1 and 2)
Or Sammy
"Oh i'll show you a bigger target." dude you have no idea how much i say things like that
bring back the old game theory
#TeamBendy
I opened sim city as they said i am being watched so it said i am being sim city
Gotta love that intro.... XD
We ArE WOrKinG On SCaTEr PloTs IN SChOol I DONT NeEd YOu ToO

I DONT NEED U TOO! HMMMM!
Passed out 8th grader in the corner softly dyeing
#TeamBendy
4:49 Scatter plot
Hey Matpat! 
What if the Dark Revival is the same story, but you play as the Person who becomes The Piper! Think of it! ‚ÄúReawakened the Dark‚Äù could mean the ink machine was turned on again after the Studio was abandoned! But that‚Äôs just a theory, a bread theory.
I'm completely in love with this new forMAT that actually has Mat talking to the viewers.
I‚Äôve been scared of playing bendy and the ink machine, so I don‚Äôt know why I bought it for my xbox,  and now I want to play the next bendy and the ink machine game
12:55 and I thought that guy was gonna make it in dying light. Thanks
6:50 is there something beside matpat?
Great vid my man üë®
I‚Äôm team angel all the way if this is the case
0:25 was that Jason ?
9:30 Am I the only one who only sees 2 extra marks on the 5 base counting system that is tallies? Shouldn't the last digit of the total be either a 2 or a 7 then? Where does 414 come from?
OMG. The editing is so freaking good! Who's your editor MatPat?
‚Ä¢ Your choices effect the game
‚Ä¢ Monsters trying to escape 
Meatly are you trying to copy Undertale...
Nice Borderland promotions








now i want a borderlands theory
Theory -
Maybe Dark Revival storyline takes place between Henry's arrival in the studios and Sammy turning into inky creature. 
Ink Demon, Alice Angel and others are all present and we play as Sammy Lawrence who led to the "dark revival". Or maybe we play as a new character who arrived at the studious before Henry but managed to escape and he was the one who left behind the secret golden messages on the walls. He could be the one who was stuck for 414 days instead of Henry. 
I know MatPat said no prequel but maybe?
This is a perfect video to watch after watching Hachiko...
I finally figured it out b o r s I s is fixing the ink m
When someone says there dead inside 



Me: Oh no


They: ????


75 years later: They die with no body.
I was laughing so hard at the begining of the vid
WAIT A MINUTE!!!!
What if the someone is the player coming to stop the evil time loop? And the choices we make are to help the player, or to side with the games characters and protect the 'game' from changing? And depending on if you side with the characters, the butcher gang have a bigger story????
But hey! That's just a theory...
A GAME THEORY!!!!
Thx 4 reading
I'll make sure you are a bigger target 


uUh
The intro...
If you ask me it‚Äôs going to be in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world which is an alt
MatPat thinks he‚Äôs in an ink puddle. Lol
i prefer the old edits
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO THROW IT AT MY HAND!

Your hand was a bigger target...
Wow this plot is alot like the Mob of The Dead storyline from COD zombies. Continuous loop until your character breaks the cycle. Wish MatPat would do a theory on that series. So much lore to look into.
I noticed something! The liar belt also had a 4 on it. And if 414 is something, maybe the 4 could also be something. Maybe the loop is a lie.
PET SCOPE GOT UPDATED! PLEASE MAKE A THEORY ABOUT IT!!!! MATTTTTTTT!
When you think you‚Äôre finally done with two horror story lines but they both come out with a new game
*me at full volume at 3 am *

Matpat: ITS NOT OVER YET
I looked at my notifications 10 minutes ago and it wasn't in there...










WHY?
Mat: I'm finally finished with this game
Game Dev: Nope
Mat: That has to be it, the games done
Game Dev: Nope
Mat: THAT HAS TO B-
Game Dev: NO
Whoever is bothering to read this... Always know that there is someone out there who loves and supports you and have a great day/night!
Also, take a free cookie!
(„Å§‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)„Å§üç™
üêáMatPat's start is the best start plus the first time I've played Bendy and the Sammy battle I was so confused I had to watch theorist.
I miss BATIM the ending was kinda not cool
Ur heads a bigger target Lmao that's funny in dead
Sammy made a choice to try and kill you makes sense right so doesn't that mean that it's referred to Sammy's choices not the player in the game choices
This video messes with me so bad. Sammie Lawrence is my name üòÖ
#teambendy
no offence but could you guys think about going back to the old format? this one is nice but there are other channels that do  this type of thing. your guy's channel was unique with the drawings
go back to the recording closet
do you have a new mic or something cus your quieter?
ladies and gentlemen i'm #teamboris
Be my waifu Matt patty
What if Sammy created a monster that feeds off fear and when it gets enough it destroys the whole place
Fnaf came back
Bendy came back
What will come back next!?
Undertale!?
Idk ._.
What...







Is Bendy harder to figure out than FNAF then?
When MatPat is talking about Sammy Laurence, my thought of why he says benevolent demon and then hates him in chapter 4 is because it might be the loop that makes him worship Bendy again, because in chapter 2-4 it‚Äôs still the same story and he might have had his opinions of Bendy reset by the loop.
But then again, that‚Äôs just my thoughts :)
5:12 best background for youtube compression (10/10) XD
dat intro tho
This is not Knack 2. I am disappointed MatPat.
I think the new voice MIGHT be Bendy? Plz don't call me dumb if I'm wrong, I LOVE YOU GAME THEORY!
That was sus
the opening = amazing, perfection, hilarious....
Sammy saying someone has reawakened is referring to Henry fixing the ink machine!
Matpat : fnaf is quiet 
reality : you have made more fnaf vids for 1 to 5  then chapters 1 to 5 in bendy and the ink machine
damn getting blazblue flashbacks
‚ÄúMonsters, Demons , and Angels‚Äù OH MY!!!!
I love the game!
Make a new intor
what if the creator is the watcher, and is fixing the ink machine and torturing the characters? what if he‚Äôs behind it all?
I'm surprised this wasnt about petscop
Bendy and the dark revival! anti-deltarune hmm these are both pretty deep series, Colab!?
Choose your side:
Walk among angels üòá or Dance with Demons üòà 
What really remains is your choice....
6:50 what realy hapened to mat when the camera left
Like how matpat slowly puts the new format of having his face in the video
This format sucks I miss the old style with matpat not on Screen cringing it up to unwatchable..
6:46 look behind matpat
GUYS A NEW FNAF GAME WAS SHOWN ON STEAM!! CHECK IT OUT!! It‚Äôs unable to play but SOONNNN
its a mequel
Maybe abandoned characters that weren't used by the animators are the main villans in Bendy?
The mask Samy wares is different from the mask on the floor so maby there are many different people like samy samy
If I would choose a path ( demon or angel )








I‚Äôm gonna say 
Not sure if hyped more for Avengers Endgame or Bendy and the Dark Revival...
when were all supposed to be talking about bendy we talk about math when im already IN MATH CLASS
Mike Mood also tweeted the number 414 and #tagged it
like #bendy414
If anyone finds this, my name is Henry.
And I'm quite hungry.
Whose team would you pick? Like team bendy comment team Alice
Look at the molecule structure of inc. Your welcome.
Okay so in the chapter where you choose the Angel or Devil most people picked Angel but it ultimatly leaded to a bad side despite it looking like a good side. So I'm team Bendy because I think it'll lead to a better ending
We need a new petscope episode !
#teambendy
team bendy
The beginning was actually funny, I love gt
Roses are a dark red the girl in The simpsons is lisa. Florida man who Allegedly Threatened family with cold play Lyrics Ends standoff after SWAT promises him pizza
Only MatPat would count all those tally marks at the start of the new game in order to make a huge discovery in the two games. See this is the kind of smart, detailed oriented thinking I need on my indie game theories ü§ìüëç
Abusive boss...
matpat: releases a single video
Fnaf: Hold my robots
Bendy: Hold my ink
Petscop: Hold my missing kids

Anyone else gonna comment on Bendy's Inkdrop Distance. Just me then? Okay...
Welcome to game theory
The channel that ruins games :)
What if sammy was callimg Henery the dark being reawakened? Like when Henery comes back sammy tells or prays to bendy saying that henery has returned to turn on the ink machine again?
I love the new way of you doing your theories! You being there on the screen makes me connect you and the theory more.
6:50
WATCH OUT DUDE
O NOES THE GAME IS TOO NOISY 
HE CAN'T HERE US
Ummmm, I don‚Äôt think the editors were happy when you attacked them with a plunger in the beginning so they made you go down into a trash can!
Hey matt question if beast bendy has no soul then why doesn't he turn into ink like brute boris
Was bacon soup explained??
Bendy is becoming the new FNAF on this channel
That "LIAR" on fisher looks an awful lot like 414R to me.
THE BEGINNING THO!! OMG LMAOO
At 6:51 theres something behind Mat
#bendy2
Game theory can you make a theory of Terraria
matpat I love your videos deeply, but i am honestly more a fan of the times when game theory was made in a clauset, then recorded infront of a greenscreen
I like this new Madpat
Remove thy face from this verily screen
Maybe that gun belonged to human that is the piper, maybe bendy did something to the piper when they were human and the piper used the gun to try and kill human bendy but fails, so bendy sacrifices him (and maybe the butcher gang) to the ink machine
And he mutated him with the rest of the butcher gang. Maybe the butcher gang were just 3 people who were done with bendy and trued to get revenge but failed so bendy punished them. In the new game what if the piper retaliated and left team bendy?
This thing is harder that a school lesson
matpat: me disappearing to a puddle of ink, do it editors!
editors: puts in trash
me thinking while watching: matpat just went to the trash much deeper huh?
XD uwu uwu uwu
No one:
Scott and Meatly: We‚Äôve got a new game!
MatPat: Are you trying to kill me?
Editors: How the f*** am I supposed to make you freaking melt?
Matpatt can you do some research why sniper can piss so much (TF2) since you did the pyro
The voise sounds like the senator/Dark Jedi master :-)
Ik something about dark revival might have a good ending of having Henry escape like if you think so
Demons,angels 
.... doggos?--
BATIM 2, Tokeo drift
8mins in and he gives us the question for today
Anyone else notices he said "if you add up these tally marks it equals 414" but the tally marks end in a 2?
#teambendy :v
I think that the butcher gang we're workers of the studio that didn't follow bendy so he tortured them
Maybe an Origins strory of bendy
E C U A S V  Y E H
Isn't it possible that tge observer could be the player himself?
3:32

THATS NOT SAMMY'S MASK
look at the teeth that sammy has on the mask he has on his face, Then look at the teeth on the mask that is on the floor near the tub with the reoccurring ink-demon. Its not the same. The teeth on Sammy's face, some are covered by ink, on the floor the teeth are clean. MatPat, you look deep into details with many things, HOW DID YOU MISS THIS 

(p.s im not saying the candle theory is incorrect, thats pritty good. I missed that myself)
Who else saw the lost one at 6:50?
1:51 bahahahaha
I wonder if there‚Äôs something if you play through the game 413 times and get to ‚Äú414‚Äù.
Was the voice gaster
18:16 Someone on the editing team obviously watched the BrainScratchComms playthrough of Sonic 06; only, instead of Princess Elise, it's MatPat that's being put in the recycle bin.
You technically won because James was wearing your merch when he competed in the airsoft battle.

I just said go to a mall because it's easy to lose cash in a mall. Anyone here ever been to a mall?
I was at a college and I saw a guy wearing a shirt saying ‚ÄúMay the f=m*a be with you‚Äù and I died!
You can win by just by tipping a waiter the rest of the money after buying something from that restaurant.
Technically it follows the rules. You‚Äôre just trying to spend all the money
Also I don‚Äôt understand anything about index whatever‚Äôs.
MatPat: I figured out how to beat the $100,000 challenge

MrBeast: Wait,  that's illegal
What about paying off a student loan?

Buy $100k worth of bitcoin

You didn't take into account "benefit value"
For instance, since I'm starting an animation company, putting it towards electronics equipment would be much more useful for me that for lots of other people.

Buy $100,000 worth of gold bullion. Lapse the time, show the gold to the person who gave you the money, sell it.

C'mon it's not even remotely difficult to do. The only issue is finding a place with that much gold bullion to sell. But ~100 oz of gold isn't really that much.
1. Mr Beast gives me $100k to spend in an hour
2. I buy $100k worth of gold
3. Wait for time to run out
4. Sell all the gold back
5. Now I have unlimited time to spend the money

As a Wise Guy, i'll invest it in the stock market instead :)
I thought that it was the Battle Royale...
Okay then
I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt care what you say I‚Äôm buying 48 cats
Hahahahahahaha. 
Actually, if you account the inflation, the real interest rate isn‚Äôt actually that high.
Stocks just buy stocks
I just wana pay for my boyfriends college. If I had anything left I would give it to my family in need.
Oh come on we all know the answer is Amazon gift cards. You can do it instantly, and they never loose their value.
‚ÄùHey Mat, did you know that Mr. Beast is from North Carolina?‚Äù
My mind instantly went to down payment on a house. Like a big down payment on a cheap house. That would be amazing.
Buy a bunch of amazon gift cards
1:can buy anything on amazon
2:if not on amazon, buy gift cards for the store that‚Äôs not on amazon
LISTEN TO RON SWANSON AND INVEST IN GOLD
North Carolina Squad let's go
I thought you were gonna talk about the battle royale game.
Beast it‚Äôs his nature to do math with money ü§Ø
If only he realised what he said at 1356
Petscop 17!!!! IT CAME OUT!
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY !!!!!!!!!
Mr Beast: 100k do whatever you want
MatPat: everything you buy is worthless
How to win the Mr.Beast 100k challenge, buy a loan for slightly less than 100k(choose an amount which you will have to pay off exactly 100k including interest), then pay off said loan immediately. Doing this means you would've spent all your 100k, and be able to keep almost all the 100k


But, in case the bank won't allow you to buy and then immediately pay off a loan, then you can just put the money in your bank account. If the IRS asks why you suddenly gained 100k, tell them it about the 100k challenge, and how you "spent" all of it by putting it in the bank account


Edit after watching the video: Welp, I lost, but it was still a good bet...
OI

TALK ABOUT THE LATEST PETSCOP

IT'S VERY CONCLUSIVE AND I WANT ANSWERS
Happy days said you are helping the 1.3 update for terraria
Literally what I‚Äôve been learning about the last 3 months in school
YouTuber: exists
Nord VPN: allow me to introduce myself

Edit: geez thx guys for all of the likes!
Wait a minute spend it on gold so you technically spent it so then after the hour sell it boom house
NordVPN is great, but I won‚Äôt need it to warch you. The EU is not Europe so some contries are "safe". Everyone should have a VPN tho.
IM FROM NC!!!
Okay but the Steph and MatPat skit was amazing, need more random but good, diverse content like that!!
North Carolina having wonderful schools is a funny joke
Just buy expensive shiz. Wait a day. And then return everything without Mr.Beast knowing.
Why don't you invest in some small business
Clear all debts. Buy gift cards for food and gas. I'd be happy with that.
Jake Peralta!!!!
just buy $100,000 worth of visa gift cards
Why do all the NordVPN sponsored people never mention that "making your internet traffic look like it's coming from a different country" slows down said traffic? Or that NordVPN's servers could theoretically view all your traffic? 
I feel like these are fairly important things to bring up.
I‚Äôll just buy a 69‚Äô RS/SS 4spd Camaro and a 79‚Äô C30 Dually Chevy truck. That‚Äôs just under $100k. I‚Äôll spend the rest on a better phone and computer. Lol
They came out with petscop 17
How much do you bet Chandler watched this videoÔºà‚ïπ‚ó°‚ïπÔºâ
"...because we're internationally friendly." (unlike article 13)
that made me laugh lol
Could you do a theory on how strong is links hyrule shield and what‚Äôs it‚Äôs made from?
I would buy a bunch of random things for 100,000$ and sell each one of them but raise the price slightly and if I end yo selling them all I would get around 200,000-500,000 or buy a single Diamond ring then sell it for 10x the price a make 1,000,000. After I do either one of those options I would wait until Black Friday or a better sell on things I want.
In case anyone here didn‚Äôt know, mr.beast is from North Carolina
I've heard her say that on a GTLive Stream. üòÇ
Hey MatPat, did you know that Mr.Beast is from North Carolina?
Just want to let you know.
IS THAT MEADHAUL IN THE THUMBNAIL!?!?!?
Haha I'm in the UK and the IRA here is something very bad but let's go into detail
Oh‚Ä¶ I was going to say gift cards stock up on them gift cards!!
I have to say, the scripted Stephanie cracked me up more than anything else. üòÇ
I would use the money to get tacos.




Hey, I got a like. But, why is it blue?
I fill like you should put these YouTuber videos on film theory.
Dude he stole lil pumps 200 one dollar bills and the fife euro too
donating to a church or hospital is in the rules?
what about vintage guitars?
2:21
And Steph is just casually playing with underwear...
As you do. XD
My list: quality computer + phone & nintendo switch + DS & pokemon Sword/Shield, X/Y, Sun/Moon & Vanguard cards (ok the last one is something you can spend all your money on & still have stuff left to buy...)
I‚Äôd buy a top tier gaming pc and the rest would probably go on cameras - who doesn‚Äôt like a Leica?
did you know mr. beast is from north carolina?
Mr.Beast is basically ricegum but he doesn't flex he gives back to the community
With the money, I would buy North Carolina!
What about gold bars? They would appreciate in value. Or drop in price idk.
MrBeast wants to know your location
just buy a car, then the next day return it then u have 100k and u can do whatever u want with it regardless of the time limit
How about buying something that cost 10000 $ then wait for the day to be over then sell it for 10000 $ and you can keep it
"Don't spend it on tech, you won't make anything on it!"

But what if I just want the tech stuff?
I would but 100k worth of gold
Omg! Matpat, did you know MrBeast is from north carolina?!
I'd watch a sitcom of MatPat and Steph and their team
That free improv show got me good üòÇ ha me
Did you know that mr beast is from North Carolina?
NC has shitty Hospitals though.
Bro when did Matpat turn into Dave Ramsey?

The best way to spend $100,000 is to buy your merchandise
Roulette would be the best chance if it was gambled and easier bet management too
MATPAT I challenge you to make a cookie clicker theory if you LOSE you have to make a tiktok compilation

I would obviously convert it into Galleons, and invest it in Gringotts Wizarding Bank.
Was that diet pepsi in the first few scenes...




Blasphemy
Buy luxury car and then sell it a day after it thus getting most of the money back.
2:26
Looks like mat pat has had enough
the best investment is obviously game theorists' merch
0:06
Matpat,
just buy the entire stock of diet coke in your nearest walmart.
Not even a game theory why not make a life theory channel
I had a dream that MrBeast was a cereal killer. Same with you.
I would waste it on video games I've always wanted and to buy myself some internet üò¢
you should do a theory on the horror game devotion
or at least play it
I need to tell you something.





Mr beast is from North Carolina
Mr.Beast is generous and also... Idk what word fits with it
What if you live in au and there is a superfund
100k of pokemon boosters. :v
Petscop 17 mattypatty
You should pay Scott Cawton to tell you the FNAF storyline
Why not gold
Come on, MatPat, pay your editor well. That Amiibo collection won't sustain itself.

I must find a philanthropist to get money!!
How to win





Give it to charity. All of it.
The first thought that came to my mind was bills. IDK what that says about me, but that was honestly my first thought.
To think I'd find out how to get 100k dollars by watching this video...
#NorthCarolinaGang
You spend it all on robux
Or a 100,000 visa gift card.
Petscop 17 baby ..... your welcome

4: Challenge completed in under 10  minutes.

dude just buy a bunch of jewelry and return after the challenge is over
I don't know if anyone else has said anything but man, Mat really likes to shout out to his team doing the work for GT and FT.
I legitimately thought that this was just 1 giant Diet Coke joke.

Hey Matpat I am A huge fan of you. By the way, I am new new here.
Idk if you can but if you could just convert the hundred thousand into another currency.
disappointed the punchline wasn't to spend it all on his merch
bring back matpat with the podium
Make a theory about the identity of h20 delirious
You can call him Mr. Beat
shouldnt this be on film theory?
If MatPat was the person giving out the money
MatPat: gives money
Person: is this for me 
MatPat: yes but hey that's just a theory a financial theory
I'm very poor so there ain't much I'd want. A used car, a new auto tool kit, a new gaming PC, a drum set, a keyboard, a bed and that's about all I really want
NORTH CAROLINA GANG!!!
Mr. Beast is pretty cool. 

Nickels.
Buy second hand Rolexes
Nobody:

Stephanie: I‚ÄôM FROM NORTH CAROLINA!!!
I would go to the apple store and ask for 5 iPhone so maxes and 3 Mac books
Matt would probably need a new liver with all the coke he would consume if given the chance
Can't we buy a bunch of stuff then return it? After the hour
awww i'm kinda sad i thought it was gonna be war bonds
Ooh im from North carolina, 
Did you guys know Mr beast is from north carolina too? WOAH did you guys know steph is too?

New petscop videos are out.Dont't know wether to be happy or sad
I‚Äôm surprise you didn‚Äôt think of buying a luxury tiny house, there usually 60k. Also I‚Äôm talking about a mobile one.
And that's a financial theory. Not a game theory.

 Unless, it's the Game of Life you're talking about.
I could use $100,000 to pay off some of my bills and then buy more manga.
13:34 any northern Irish or even Irish folk watching you know what this is
In pounds please I'm uk-ish
What about a Rolex Submariner and an Omega Speedmaster?
Matt: I'll spend it on diet Coke
Me:LEGOS!!! 
Matt: ...?
e expected u to say the best investment is buy merch
Just buy gold lol. Sell if afterwards
Just buy a Lamborghini Gallardo, drive it for a comfortable amount of time after the hour, then sell the car. The rules are that you have to spend all $100,000 in that hour, but it says nothing about keeping what you bought. After selling the Gallardo, you can buy whatever you want under $100,000. Boom!
I‚Äôd personally just buy a gaming pc, go to a store and buy a bunch of gift cards for Nintendo e-shop or for steam

And maybe buy all the homestuck albums, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd even want to use it all :/ I‚Äôd feel bad xD

I might‚Äôve used it on a boat or cosplay


Oh wait it‚Äôs about 1000000kr .. that‚Äôs a lot o jeez
What if you buy a Tesla.

No gas,
Very little maintenance.
Luxury car.
Fits right in.
I'm from North Carolina
Doesn' t gold go up in price all the time??
I thougth he was gonna say to spend it on something that‚Äôs personaly importend to you
How is this a GAME THEORY
MatPat's ideas:
TX calculators
Cheez-Doodles
DietCokes
A Water-Proof Computer
What about crypto currency even if the price goes down then just take the money back out after the hour passes
I think it is important to note that japanese sports cars are ridiculously cheap to maintain
Did anybody from Ireland / Northern Ireland think of the IRA at 15:33 ? (almost anybody who isn't from Ireland/Northern Ireland probably won't get this. Sorry.)
What if you buy action stocks from Coca Cola  or Google?
I'd just pay bills, including prepaying bills...100k isn't really that much money when put into context
hey Matt Pat just wanna let you know petscop 17  is out
Petscop 17 just came out
Shoes. Nike‚Äôs and Jordan‚Äôs

Mr Beast? The one who had a "I spent 24 hours in a mental hospital" video on my recommended for a few weeks?



Weak. I spent 72 hours in a mental hospital.
What if you bought a bunch of random stuff and sell all of it at the exact price so you keep the money forever
If Mrbeast give me 10k, I would like any other cultured humans and just waste it on Games, Animes, Snacks, Pay tax, And a new wifi..




P.S Mrbeast is from North Carolina
Howsabout giving the money to homeless people? Eh, MatPat?
couldnt you just by smth for 100k, like a car... wait for challenge to end... return the car... keep the money... dont need to be rushed?
Can mr. Beast give me 100k to get top surgery.

Invest all of it on stocks.
I was going to say hedge fund
Me beast needs to spend $10,000 on chucks in one video
puts all money in bank account
actually, the best investment is in Game/Film Theory merch
That's why you buy a Tesla
This is game theory not beast theory
Why not transfer it into foreign money and transfer it back
13:37 title of your sex tape



Sorry cuz I had to do it üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I thought you were gonna say theorist merch
1:20 when I heard the Europe dollar I knew you were gonna say that joke
Bro we buy tech to use than to sell. It's not our money anyway
PETSCOP HAS UPLOADED!!!
these double uploads have been amazing‚ù§Ô∏è
Actually, the best way to spend all that money is donating to good causes like, one example, human trafficking, but sure. Enjoy your watches and cool shoes.
The intro hurt me to my very core
Before you say it your lurch is what you should buy with 100,000$
You always seem to talk about the same subjects we talk about at my High School. Except you make them a lot more fun.
Or Win a youtuber Royal like James and Jaiden.
Jake peralta NYPD
what if you die before reaching 60 years old.
The whole time I was thinking IRA...




AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW
Hey matpat , I‚Äôm from North Carolina
Wait stop rigth there did you know Mr beast is from north carolina
Anyone from North Carolina
is stocks a good choice?
WEST CAROLINA
I mean, I'd get 100's into gift cards. But that's cool too.
me when i first found out about MatPat:
OH MY GOSH! Matt‚Äôs from Ohio?! 

Anyone: hey look MatPat posted a new video

Me: he‚Äôs from Ohio you know?
This is like an idle clicker game
Hahahahaha, how funny, i have ALREADY THOUGHT OF THIS. When i thought of it, i had a similar answer, my answer was to post an item on some site like offer up/letgo, and price it for the amount of money you have recieved, you would just buy something from yourself, this is a simple solution that results in you having the amount of money within the given hour, for you have technically spent it. You just buy the item from yourself, it could be a rock that you found on the ground.

When you have officialy recieved the money and its yours for sure, its a good idea to do what Matt said, put it into retirement funds, if you dont want to put all of it into retiement funds, you have as much time to think about it as you want!
is it sad that everytime this starts i say, "hello internet welcome to game theory!" and when it ends i say, "but that's just a theory, a game theory, thanks for watching." i think this proves how much of a fan i am. lol
I‚Äôm subbed to Mr. beast
I thought of a strat


First you get your friend to sell you a pen

Second buy it for 100k 

Third step resell that pen to your friend
I'ma just buy some video games( and amibos)
I need nordvpn  BTW i am from Danmark
Mr Beast has joined the chat
I‚Äôd spend it all on LEGO
Just offer your mom 100,000 bucks for a hug.
Oh yeah
As soon as it started i thought Stocks. Because my grandpa invests in stocks.
or  13  acres of land or more 100 acres
The beginning was fun. Ha, Mat‚Äôs such a nerd!
Google what are the highest paid jobs in the world?

1# Being Mr.Beast's friend
2# Owning a Multi-Billion Dollar Company
Personally the game is easy for me as a guitarist I could go to a Guitar Center in spend and spend all that money on probably quite a few nice guitars and some nice amps and effects due to some of my favorite brands being at least 2 grand per instrument
If I was taking part in this challenge, if and only if it is put into my credit card, I'll probably just go on JetPens and buy a lot of stationary...especially copics. You can never have too many copics.
I aM FRoM NorTh cARoLinA
Correction: Mr Beast's $100,000 challenge is not a game it's a way of life.
Couldn‚Äôt you buy a lot of jewelry than sell than for more?
7:22  This house is also in the Gamegrumps video "Our House". Ok, cya.
Hey mat petcop has released 3 vids in a row in a day and none of them make sense

Imagine how much diet water you can buy

Instead of getting a EXOTIC PET maybe get a rabbit, cat or dog?...
Have fun with petscop!
The clips in the beginning is EXACTLY what matpat would do
I'd buy as much fnaf merch as i can
New petscop is out boiiiiiis
I would just buy stuff and after the challenge is over return them.
I was thinking spending it on gift cards, because that increases the time you could spend it in.
What if you buy something worth $100,000 and then return it after the 1 hour and get the money back I didn‚Äôt watch the video so if this is what it says sorry but just saying
When u run out of ideas
Just buy a monster pc lmao
Buy 20k pc

MatPat: great schools!

Me: HA! Boy, you know nothing! The school system here sucks!!!

Dude. Taxes for Mr Beast must have sucked
Hey MatPat!
Did you know Mr. Beast is from NC!
THERES TWO NEW PETSCOP VIDS
IRA is quite good, but what about charity?
When I was in High school, my business teacher gave us a similar prompt as a final project. The specs were the same, except that the sum of money was a tad larger, and we had to make a Excel sheet spending that EXACT AMOUNT. I think she made it a smidge easier on us by telling us not to worry about the sales tax, yet I don't remember. Anyway while I don't remember what I put on my Excel sheet, I do remember the agony of trying to make the math work so that it didn't go over the limit. I'm pretty sure this project was supposed to show us how to either wisely spend money in the business field or how Microsoft Excel can automatically calculate the cost of things in your spreadsheet. I'm rambling, yet my point is that I understand the pain Matpat felt in his opening joke a little too well.
Why is this not on film theory?
Or you trade the 100k money for another 100k money and keep it cuz they're not the 100k money Mr. Beast gave to you.










 : It's even easier because Mr. Beast gave the money to a group of people. Just trade it and take your time to think about what you could do with the money.
YO MATPAT! CAN YOU ARGUE WITH MY DAD FOR A BIT I NEED TO PROVE HIM WRONG.
i would just go to the bank and buy 100,000 dollars. Rookies.
13:25 is what you came for
Just buy 100000 one dollar bills
just buy about 20 college textbooks, 
but then again, 100k might not be enough nowadays.
Math ruining the fun as always
I would put the money in a treasure chest and burry it
‚ÄúI got a 5 euro.‚Äù





Yeah it‚Äôs pretty clear that Mat is American...
i'll bye a new truck
You pretend to give it all to a friend.
Then you split it.
Boom.
Spent.
How ‚ÄòBout South Carolina?
This is awesome!
I know the best way to spend the money: 
Save some for yourself and give the rest to ruputatble charities
Visa gift cards!
Don‚Äôt mind me, just waiting for Mr. Beast to come and comment
I am also for the NC...
HES FROM GREENVILLEE BOISSSS
Yeet...

who else thought this video was about the 100k youtuber tournament
I‚Äôd spend it on manga. Hehe
being a nerd is always a good thing
OOOR , heres a better idea , buy food
What state is mr. Beast from again?
No, clickbait YouTubers don't spend 250 grand on Lamborghinis, they spend a few hundred dollars a day
Now the real question is what do you do with the money after you get it back
WHAT ABOUT STUDENT LOANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
just get a credit card  and pay it off if you are impacient
I'd probably get gold....
Oh hello there! 
So you're searching a MrBeast comment too?
There isn't one

7:40 I had that experience, had to move out for a month. Then a year later found out that last year it wasn‚Äôt fixed properly so had to move out for three months and now realized they did it wrong again so I have to move out for another week.
Woah Ira is a town in Texas and that‚Äôs where I go to school
I‚Äôm from North Carolina, and MrBeast is legitimately the only thing we have. Let us have this one thing, MatPat. ONE thing.
Did anyone else get that add with the guy in the expensive car just after he said not to get a car?

to be honest investment is good and the best and I agree for being a marketing student sure you spend it all but you gain it in time depending in the rate of interest and the flow within the cash.

Were Is Mr. Beasts comment
Or you know....buy groceries.
I‚Äôm a finance student and while I agree your conclusion is the smart thing to do I think it outside the spirit of a Mr. Beast video.  I don‚Äôt think the viewers would wanna watch u buy an index fund.
Just give it to a homeless man
Beast should of let him do the sales tax atleast
Or you set up a go-fund-me page or a kickstarter for 100,000$ to you and donate, thus technically spending the money and keeping it for yourself to use without a time constraint.
I guess one could also do what they did and spend it all on fleeting material goods, but keeping in mind that those items shouldn't be bought to be sold.
Love hearin a answer I can‚Äôt understand
Back in my senior year of high school we played a stock game in our economics class. We were each given a certain amount of money and were allowed to buy and sell stocks based off of the real world market. Some thought it best to invest in a single company. Netflix and Walmart were pretty popular options. Some bought and sold at random.

I had realized that for every penny a stock went up in price, every stock I had would go up a penny. And so I found the absolute cheapest stocks I could and bought them 1000-2000 at a time. It didn't matter whether they were currently climbing or falling. I would then check every 30 minutes. If they had fallen, I would immediately sell. If they'd risen, I'd wait.

For 3 months I would spend 3-4 days a week doing this, before getting bored. with 3 months left in the contest, I had effectively quit. Meanwhile other players were buying and selling stocks on a day by day basis. In the end, I had a 40% increase from my starting value and was #1 on the leaderboard. The closest second only had 20% from a lucky bid.

I then went on to fail Economics. Though that was more due to sleeping during the class (a habit I picked up from sleeping in geometry first period my junior year, thank you CAHSEE ).
I would say gold smh
You mom gay
I love this
How about spend it all on vbucks frum fortnite cuse you will have a lot

im watching this like if Mr beast is gonna give me that kind of money :/
Just get gift cards lol
9:51 i was actually drinking a bottle of water when he said that and i slowly put my bottle of water down like  -_-
ya know, when mrbeast is sponsored, it's kind of dumb. 
when companies want to sponsor mrbeast, they say, "here's a bunch of money, it's like $10,000. someone's gunna have to pay tax for that."
that's something that i think personally scares him, but with youtube, he gets paid either way. so, he uses the money because he knows he's going to get paid, i guess. so he does stuff with the money like donating to twitch streamers, or donating to homeless people, or buying a lamborghini aventador s. he gets paid because, well to be honest, all his videos these days go viral. that's what makes him one of the fastest growing channels on the planet. but the real scary part of this crazy adventure he's taking, is the tax. from what i could imagine, it's over $1,200,000. and if we're lucky, he can pay them off. which he probably will.
I would buy the best thing you can buy





Game Theory merch
just buy a drum set
2:20 MatPat there is just like me

Means: Do you have the virus

I dont think is worth till ut 60 to get 2M. I mean, what can you do with all the cash then? Yeah, sure, you have a LOT of money, but by that time you will have most of the things you wanted. So what can you do? Buy medicine?  Cuz thats rly the only option I see. If you have a family, ok, give them the money.
I guess green screen Mat Pat is replacing Mat Pat on debate stand?

I disagree with your point on electronics becuase they will likely make use out of them, and arent buying them as store of wealth, buying a car or fleet of cars isnt terrible idea eitherif they dont buy some thing stupid
Investments

A "GAME THEORY!!!".
Is it though Matmat? Isn't it a financial theory?
12:51 Jake Peralta from Brooklyn 99
what is a game theory anymore?
Horrible Advice.

Stock markets are a lot harder to manipulate without a lot of prior knowledge and study to find the best stocks to buy, and even then there is an optimal time to buy-in, which does not necessarily land within that 1 hour time frame. Also, you will have to spend your time and effort nurturing your investment, yadda yadda yadda, and chances are the average layman will hire a broker or something to help manage these investments. Even then, you cannot guarantee that you are not going to lose all your investments on a bad day. In that sense, it is similar to gambling - you may win big, but you could also lose big. Hardly the most reliable method.

I would prefer investing in government bonds that are credible, or using it as capital to start a small business. Another thing that one could consider would be to spend it on a sprinter van that one can convert into a live-in space. Mixture of both a car and a house, but not as draining in terms of maintenance, or worry about all the paperwork you have to sign, etc.
or the best way to spend it is on steam community market csgo skins
Nobody:

roth ira is better, you get taxed first and not later.
This of course assumes you have no pre-existing debt, where compound interest is working against you.

Just buy it all ins tocks

One answer... buy 100 golden pans in tf2
Just buy gold 4Head
I‚Äôm going to put out a recommendation for a future video. Try and see who is the strongest fire emblem character in the games based off of all possible weapons such as comparing marth‚Äôs falchion with Roy‚Äôs binding blade just to see who is the overall strongest fire emblem character based off there weapons abilities.
Buy gold. Sell it later.  Done.

Just put it in a bank account and then it‚Äôs yours.
Matpat... what you said at 13:40... I relate to on a spiritual level.  I feel you man.  Love all your work btw, please keep it up!!!
If I get that $100k I would put it in a long term savings account or long term investment account that pays monthly interests in a bank. Such Long term accounts has a lower interest rate than IRA - somewhere around 6% annual, but monthly payments makes it work as if it is salary from a job although I don't have to work for it.
Im gonna buybtons of air soft
One Q
What about foooood
Legend says that Mr.Beast is still from North Carolina
Last question......

What do with the two million dollars? What if your too old to spend the money or you don‚Äôt have other people to give too? It is the best solution but life could change in matters of years are if you spend it now, you‚Äôll get to enjoy the items you buy cause your not a retired old person. It‚Äôs just my opinion.
im at the beginning so idk if this is his solution but im just gonna say investing in stock would be the way to go because youd basically still have the money and have "spent" it so youd keep it
Just put $95K into the IRA then use the $5K on what you want.
I somehow hate myself for some reason...
My first thought was actually investing it in stocks lol
I don‚Äôt really like the irl things
why is this video on "Game Theroy?"
Or just buy food....... or give it to the homeless.....
Go to the bank ask for it in 20s and it is technically not the same money
Still gonna get a switch, laptop, and PC.
2:24
I was thinking about buying books and CDs and giving the rest away to charity... but ok I guess
Oh MatPat, you and your coke addiction.

¬£100k on Black, hope I win, give back the original 100k and keep the other for myself
I would have thought either what he said or  buying gold as the best options.
MatPat I need to discuss something of urgent matter with you. It has come to my attention that a character in a video game I know of has some ulterior motives and we need to delve deeper. I have some evidence on my claims and your analysis would greatly assist my ambitious project.

Please, tell me if there are any ways to contact you personally, I cannot release this to the general public until they are ready. -Tall P
Why not put in bank and take it out in the day after

Plot twist: MrBeast sees this video
What about Amazon Vouchers?!
Or how about you get a cd account. Much lower time frame.
I remember when Matpat talked about video game theories. Good times.
MATT not everything is complex, just have fun
My first thought was pay off ovr half my student loans leaving just the 6% interest ones left
Have you seen the new bendy trailer
Really surprised my boi didn't drop the "GT merch is the best thing to spend that money on" bomb, even as a joke. C'mon MP.
solution: buy gold bullion. it can be sold, and will appreciate in value over time due to gold shortages. sell it when you need the money.


though, personally, i would probably spend a bit on a new computer, seeing as mine is dying at a rapid pace.
Stock market? Life insurance? Round trip plane tickets and hotel?
I think Mr. Beast wanted his friends to give the money to someone that ACTUALLY NEEDS IT‚Ä¶does anyone agree?
#mrbeast
Just buy the best computer best xbox and ps4 and buy some vbucks to top it all off
G A M E  THEORY btw
Be honest MatPat, you just want to lure mrbeast with this video.
Well I like lego so. I will get all the lego at the store
So we can donate?
In my opinion, this video's flaw, is that you CAN buy exotic reptiles/animals legally.
Chandler needs this
What about stocks
Kinda salty that I watched 13 minutes of video to find out that it was exactly what I assumed it would be (I'm an accounting/finance major). We are boring people and this was far too boring even for us...
My gerd I thought he was going to say theory merch
üòÖ

My wife also reminds me that MrBeast is from North Carolina..
Why not buy 100,000 in visa gift cards ü§î

You see I‚Äôve see a lot of videos about the diary of a wimpy kid 25 years later and my questions are these is it true,Was Greg already a ghost after he suicided though he continued the story and what was the ring all about and the manny too good? I hope you can make theory about it.

When you have the correct answer 30 seconds into the video because it's kind of obvious
Most youtubers bragging about their shooting skills, winners of the challenge are animators who didn't brag.
Holy crap I guessed it. (Props to my personal finance class)
Someone remind me why MatPat does this?
This whole video was just talking about nothing, you have a limited time, go to every store you can and shop!!!! We people who don't think about it call that a SHOPPING SPREE!!!!!!!

I was assuming that you had to buy ‚Äúthings‚Äù in that video. I would buy a ton of MTG cards, because I play a lot of MTG and in general reserve list cards don‚Äôt ever really go down in value.
I can easily beat this challenge. Pay off my mortgage and repair some rooms in my house.
I would buy food games and some dlc.
I actually really love this editing style! it‚Äôs a combination of his newer editing style and his old editing style. keep up the good work, matpat!

What about inflation?
How much money is going to be 2.000.000 dollars 30 years from now?
Mmm, I could be responsible in that situation, ooooor I could just buy a bunch of marvel and game theory merch
What about the 2019 Lexus LS 460

I'm liking the video style üëçüëè
Spend 100,000$?


Easy, get me some mtg cards! 


I'm serious, recent analyses found that older mtg cards retain, and increase, value more reliably than GOLD.
thank you to matpat for the sweet deal on Nord
How to ruin a mrbeast challenge
AND funtime foxy came outta nowhere
My answer
"You win"
James anthony and jaiden won the battle royal and that was crazy
I‚Äôm still going to buy vbucks and tech
Despite everything you've just said, I'd buy a black lotus in a heartbeat in that situation
U know, when MatPat said what the best choice was going to be, i thouhgt he was going to say game theory merch. Thats what id do
i think in ur fnaf theory's, you are missing something. tip: mangle sister location baby.
This is so much fun to watch lol
So having 100K is a game?
Lots and lots of cats
what about Diet Coke XD
I would spend the money on Xbox gift cards then I would waste it all on fortnite XD
or buy real estate for rent the interest rates are higher u just gotta know where to buy
How to win 
Grab the time stone and keep trying until you win

I would buy bonds and then in 10 years I got 200k

Edit: well I thought about a ira as well but I‚Äôm not old enough to have one so I would have to do this.
Mr beast: Heres's 100k, spend it wisely
Me: Goes to computer immediately, spends 10 minutes trying to get the verification code, BUYS BITCOIIIINNSSSS.
I won
1:14 wut The 5‚Ç¨ bill is green




Also that intro is brilliant
I'm waiting for MrBeast to respond to this video
I want a tank!
*Sees people buy cars *
Hahah losers
Edit:thanks for 50 likes
The best option is...







MatPats patreon!!
Delorean is exactly 100,000 dollars, boom.

Watches video

Oh.
Haven‚Äôt finished the video yet but what about gift cards
Two things:
1, I would just spend it as an advance payment on the rest of my college
2, if you're going to think about how best to use it, why not just buy gold, so you can turn right back around and resell it for the same price and then have more than an hour to look for other options?
Literally the first thing that came to mind was paying my parents' bills
Excuse me? Go to a bank, just buy gold...wtf?
1 hour to spend 100k, I would put it in my bank account after buying a MacBook. Unless the rule was in there, then I would by a car, unless I have a car, then I would by a house, if I had a house I would buy etc.
What about v bucks üòè
Who else just saw the title and thought it was another mr.beast video
Get gold it is going up in value
how boat donate to the poor
They HAD TO SPEND IT, NOT INVEST IT
I will buy funko ppos
As an accountant, I think this is one of the best episodes of game theory.
I'm really liking the new Game Theory format. Keep it up!
Me: Siri. Show me the Black Market.
Siri: Beep! Beep! Calling the police right away.
Stocks is probably best to buy so you gain get the money back later
1. Invest all in a random stock. 2. Wait an hour. 3. Pay it out. 4. Take time to spend it
I thought why can't you just buy lots of gift cards
Do a game theroy for when the darkness comes
Watching a Game Theory video about Mr. Beast and starts with an ad with Mr. Beast in it.
Seems legit
Lol I live in North Carolina and I go to that school it‚Äôs Thomas Jefferson Classical Academy or for short tjca it‚Äôs actually not that great just good ratings lol
What about the Nissan R35 Gtr that‚Äôs around $100,000
That's the most feminine masculine hand I've ever seen in my life. Uma Thurman is eating her heart out somewhere.
Can you do a tabs video!
Hey mr game theorists their is a new thing happening in fortnite yet i dont know what it is im hoping its not a portal but there is a rift glowing bright and it has a bit of design to the visitors sign.
lol im not a lambo, or a ferrari girl anyway and i do not like diamons. theyre worthless, basically. i would invest n gold and precious metals
Don‚Äôt you love watching a channel grow like crazy
did somebody say STOCKMARKET
Can‚Äôt you just buy a $100,000 visa gift card
Spend all of your money on visa gift cards, then you have as much time as you need!
Hey I know this video is not FNAF but this is the most recent video and I just had to say, check out this channel called Junior 0437 (not mine)

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
Buy a GT86
Chris rented a lambo
Invest in stock
I would spend it all on car mods
Mr matpat congrats
You bring up collectables but didn't mention Magic: The Gathering, or rather specifically, the Reserved List. There's a subset of cards that are used in older formats that are on a Reserved List, meaning that they can not and will not ever be reprinted in any playable form for any reason. Since these cards are currently in use, hence have demand, and will never grow in stock but can grow in demand as Magic grows in popularity, how would these stack up for investment?

As an example, Underground Sea (Beta) Has gone from 1000 to 5000 dollars in the last 9 years.
I love your new style of IRL videos 
Your channel is amazing
Why is everyone making Mr.Beast videos?
Just
WHY
(Aka: I got nothing against him. I just question.)
what would I buy? First, 2 tickets to the Bothwell school of wizardry, then a new drawing tablet, and then just a bunch of art stuff
Hey....the bend boi is back
1:24 I know Mrbeast from his flagship video series "Worst Intros"        Oh wait he deleted it
Chandler needs to watch this rn
Let's all play the economics game!
How to waste 100k Dollars 
1. Buy T-Series
Just buy several Toyota Corollas cause those cars last forever and the maintenance and insurance are cheap
Advice from Gruncle Stan, ‚ÄúBuy Gold‚Äù.

The price of gold won‚Äôt change too much, so you can exchange it back after the challenge. BOOM!   
+/- $100,000 that you can spend on more wisely now that you have all the time left in your life!
Pay off my moms college debt cuz i love her
Bye gold
The way i thought of to win that challenge is to buy a bunch of stuff doesn't matter what it is and then when the hour is over anything you decide you didn't want return it and buy something else

"Mr. Beast? He's from North Carolina you know" Rofl
MAT You should have said that the $100000 is best spent buying theory wear.
Wait wha
6:03 Did... you just say.... ardi?
Watches intro: 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR KIDS TUITION AND COLLEGE FUNDS LATER ON!!!!
Hes prepared
Article 13 was the internet version of order 66, and all the youtuber where the Jedi
You can‚Äôt hide from the tf2 community forever matpat we seek revenge
I would immediately pay my college tuition, I can simply deposit that money into my bank. And then pay my college fund online üëå
I'm from North Carolina too I moved there away when I was 5 to Texas.
It better to buy fun thing so ge gets you in to the next video instead of you spending it smart and only being in on it once
What about IRA contribution limits?


Can't you only contribute funds you earned (not gifts) and only up to $6,000 per year as of 2019?
That's how it is for Roth IRAs anyway...
Ok so I was watching the video from a few years back about LGBT representation in video games. Fable was literally mentioned for 2 second but I really like fable so I noticed. I was wondering if there might be a proper theory for the fable franchise? And I know about the theory about who rose is with at the end of Fable 2 love ending, but I was wondering if there was anything else because that was all I could find except some random easter eggs. 

Just thought I'd put it out there.

Love the game theorists channel. And film theory too.
Game theory...... Yeah. 


Welp I'm outtie howdy. Enjoy life without ma.
I know but 100,00 v-bucks and the rest get candy =)
I could smell the depreciation the moment I saw that jag
Whens the secret zoo level vid coming out?
Or just buy some guitars
I would go with trading... 100k investment is "a lot". If I could make 5% of that total a month its quite nice.
What about buying Gold???
I would just buy 100 000 dollars worth of gold. Then I can just sell the gold and get the money back.
I feel like my grandpa ghost wrote this video.
Ill buy a tesla
what about stock?
1:58 Mr beast is from North Carolina üòÆ I‚Äôm from North Carolina I will tell everyone this! Did you know that stranger things was made in North Carolina
Olli's kid college fund?
I would spend it on euros then convert it to cash in the next day


Edit: Or just get some stocks
what about switch games?






and why is this a game theory?
It's unlikely you'd be able to convert $100k cash into an IRA (or any online investment portfolio) within an hour. Generally, banks put a hold on large deposits before they become available.
it's OW-DEE not AW-DEE
matpat: using statistics to make me rethink life decisions since 2009.
Wa dudidi
Mr beast: "welp.....there goes the fun in my 100k challenge"
ME: Did you know I live in North Carolina too?
Matpat: STOP, please GOD MAKE IT STOP!

(I actually do live in North Carolina)
Spend it on games for more theories xd
I would just buy a corgi with pet food, toys and other supplies

Make a theory on terraria, how powerful are the Yoyos. You can use the irl one drop counterparts for the size and weight
Can't I just buy a hundred thousand dollar savings bond then cash it in when the game is done?
Just buy something that cost 10,000
Hey Matpat. Did you know Mrbeast is from North Carolina
Hey MatPat I was thinking about the pokemon Z move BLOOM DOOM and how it would work

An explosion made by flowers DOESN'T make a little of sense to me can you figure it out

Just A Guess: The Most Safe Stock Market Investment
I said stocks the first time I saw his video.
It‚Äôs not a theory it‚Äôs a theory that no one can solve (saw your TikTok on the sharpie puzzle)
You need to  be a PC gamer to win this.
Look, I‚Äôd use the cash for a trip to a bunch of major U.S. cities, but if I was thinking smart I‚Äôd invest in gold, one of the least deprecating currencies
I'm from north Carolina get recked
I wonder why non-photoshop Matpat showing up more recently in each videos? Hmmm...ü§î
Me: My mom has a BMW. üòé

MatPat: So you have to pay a lot extra for it.

Me: What do you mean?

Also me: 

Also, Also me: mOOooOoOooOMmMmMmMm
I would buy ¬£76,461 since I wouldn't return it as it isn't dollars and it is more useful to me

What if you already own a house and put the money towards that?....boom, 100k spent
Why not buy 10 percent of matpats channel
Who else saw cybert in this vid after hearing on his channel about editing for game theory
You need to let Steph know that Rhett and Link are from North Carolina as well.
I've been always wondering what is the origin of pony island.
I was just watching this video when I got a notification from Mr.Beast about a Lamborghini
Nice hoodie,  MatPat!
I bought one too.
Buy The Car, Sell The Car, Keep The Money, No Time Limit You Good Now
I had an ad about honey, that mr beast was hosting, and the video was about mr beast
I would spend the same way a great man once said ‚ÄúI would buy cocane and hookers‚Äù
pay your student lones!!!:P
The sad thing is that intro really would be mat tho
I would buy 100000 dollars worth of visa gift cards so than I would have a time limit to spend it
Or buy a 100,000$ visa gift card????
just buy some gold and think about what to do with the money later
How is this a game theory?

Corvette gets 30 mpg if you drive it right

Dude, all I want is a good laptop and like basically every Lego technic set ever
Wow, you knocked this video out of the park, the production quality is crazy!
Yo Mrbeast could you make your merch for free
Thanks i am coming from belgium
Best intro
I knew he was going to say investments
I just buy robux
I would buy everything on my Amazon wishlist, which includes (but isn't limited to) furniture, electronics, auto parts and clothing. (And since my husband and I could definitely use a decent bed, at the very least? And we desperately need new clothes? Yeah. That would actually help us.)

Also, the floor in my mom's kitchen needs to be fixed, so I'd take care of that too.
if you had 24 hours to spend 100,000 dollars, why would you waste any of that time driving ANYWHERE???
The internet EXISTS!
WASTE YER DOUGH AND NEVER LEAVE YOUR COUCH!

OR!!!

Buy gold, put it in a series of safes, bury the safes in undisclosed location. Ron Swanson it!
13:26 Fast food.            


You can give it to the poor, and eat it.
And if I buy some bitcoins?
Nice try botpat
Buy a boat
You should do some videos on mobile games like Badland or Republique.
Damn mat pat analyzing the most things without hidden meanings
I thought this episode is just a build up to new merch plug
I would spend 10k on gaming stuff then invest rest. Done.
I just wasted 20 minutes of my hour watching this.
I'd just improve my pc and buy millions of canned food so I can survive
Yay steph and mr.beast are both from North Carolina just like me.
Just buy streamer tech and wait for mr beast to donate to u again..ez
How about gold bricks or gold biscuits......you can buy them from your nearest bank at their original price.........
Welp is gonna be a rich old fart
Do a theory about the government official Jun'ko Zane talks to in the bar on Manhattan before beginning the first mission in Freelancer.
When I heard Steph talk I had to stop for a sec because I recently watched Get Out and for a second I thought she was the same person who played Rose Armitage... I need more sleep...
The problem isn‚Äôt beating his 100k challenge, it‚Äôs you using vertical in the intro
He talks about this A LOT but has he EVER gotten a coke sponsorship?
Buy gold and resell it when the time is over. Boom 100k
I GO TO THAT SCHOOL THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO STEPHANIE ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA, THOMAS JEFFERSON!!!!
Ima use it for my college debt.
I would buy expensive stuff and then sell it for more or around the price I got it for the next day and get the $100,000 back
One word: Bitcoin
100k tbh id buy csgo skins. Their price is more stable than actual crypto currency and is waay more worth than gold if you invest into the right skin.
Woah, the clock at 7:51 showed that exact time that it was in real life for me
I could use them to buy call of duty games and Nintendo switch and more things that I want
1:12 I know why you are broke




You spent all your money on diet coke
I'd use it to help mental health awareness organisations.
Just get everything you want
Ok were those live action scenes made by 2012 Smosh because I really feel like they did it
8:32 I think I‚Äôm going to cry that‚Äôs my school! I‚Äôm TJCA-!

I am a huge fan of this channel and I cannot believe that my school was in this video. I‚Äôm a varsity cheerleader at TJCA and I‚Äôm just so excited ahhh
Then buy a Tesla...
compound interest oh god I'm having 7th grade flashbacks
How about a Nintendo Switch? with Pok√©mon shield
Nice I'm from NC and I probably live 2 hours away
i had a mr beast ad come up at the start lmao
Me: I'm from north carolina
Or you just use the 13000 dollars to buy 13000 dollars so when the one hour is over the money is technically yours so you don‚Äôt have to give it backüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
VALUE!!
What do I see at 2:20? Someone not getting a Coke sponsorship.
I'm also form north Carolina
Why not gold? It also appreciates consistently over time a lot and you can take it out at anytime without penalties.
Can‚Äôt he just buy gift cards
idk if this would work, but i would convert the money into like euros and a day later, convert it back into ¬£
And food?
Did you know that mr.beast is form North Carolina?
I literally got the Honey add on this video 
however




D I D  Y O U  K N O W  H E  W A S  F R O M  N O R T H  C A R O L I N A
So if I stole a Tesla, would I be driving an Edison?
Buy something that costs:
$99,999,999.99



Oh wait you lost a penny.
I will lend the money to a friend
Then after the hour I will take it back
I will give the friend about ten percent for helping
No matter how cheesy the acting gets, it always makes me smile ^_^
CONGRATS TO JAMES JAIDEN AND ANTHONY FOR WINNING THE YTER BATTLE ROYAL
If I even had a quarter of it, I'd give it to my girlfriend. Since she can't really get anything she wants
to be honest mr beast is my idol i want to be just be like him i love his videos  and i love yours point and case being keep up the good work
In one hour, I could easily drive straight to my local bank and pay off my Mortgage...god 100k, that would be so helpful.
Mappat there's another bendy trailer but not the bendy and ink machine. No it's bendy and the dark reveal so you check out
I‚Äôd just buy a Tesla Performance Model 3
A Lexus IS a luxury vehicle that doesn‚Äôt deteriorate.
I would invest alot of the money into Robux
no i'm serious, when you think about it it's a good idea
you can transfer Robux into real money
buy limited items which will most likely gain in value
to me it seems like a great idea.
What would you do?
Or you can JUST BUY CURRENCY!?!?
hey Mat pat, Mr.beast is from North Carolina
I think i can build 100K pc
Just buy stocks
Mint 9 Alpha Black Lotus.  Sell back at your leisure.
Buy 100,000 worth of stock right before the time runs out, and then sell it back after the hour to keep the money.
Tell me why I thought he was going to say merch
13:23 I thought he was gonna say game theory Merch and troll us all lol
I thought mat was going to say spend it all on murch
Sprite lime
can I have a phone sir?
Diet Coke factory?
I would have bought tons of lego
I just realized how genius Mr. Beast is, a lot of these channels are built so that you give people money and in return they give you content or a piece of it. Beast cut out the middle man and just started shelling out hard cash in a super simplified way.
Mr Beast: you know in from North Carolina??
Me: Really? Because I‚Äôm not from North Carolina!!!
Just but gold and diamonds ITS easy
Cant we just buy a $100k Worth of gold?
Hey matpat can you do a binding of Isaac theory about the new afterbirth plus about a new ending when you beat a new boss named Delirium
lmao I got a mr beast honey ad on this
Get to the gungeon theory.
BORRRRRRRRRRRRINGGGGGGGGGGG
also why don't you just buy things you want like electronics, that you're going to use rather than just having money
I will give them to someone i know this way after the challenge he could give them back to me(probably 50% since he played a part)and i will remain with 50k or more depends on the deal.That is of course only if the rules allow it.
Why not buy ores and then sell it after the hour
GOLD?
Inflation
Why not buy V bucks???
You forgot to factor in the inflation difference with the 2 mil
Stock Market obviously.....it has the potential to turn $100K to $1M or more over the span of 25-30 years if invested correctly.
(MY GUESS, I PAUSED THE VIDEO BTW)
EDIT: I WAS RIGHT!!!
Hey steph did you know you‚Äôre from North Carolina?
How bout you give the cash to the bank, MrBeast righteously can‚Äôt get the money back!
But
The answer seems so easy to answer

You can just buy gold.
Or buy another currency.
Technically speaking it isn't cheating.
"$100,000 in v-bu- oh, oh god I'm so sorry"
$100,000 dollars, spend it in an hour!
Everyone: Electronics!
Me: books... drawing supplies... more books
Higher markups include IV bags in the US with a markup of 12500%
UC
VBucks
Robux
Uhhhhh






Yeah
matpat! did you know that mr beast is from north carolina! just like steph!
He's from North Carolina don't ya know
I'd buy gold bars cause somewhat stable market and easy to reconvert into money
Gets a divorce filed hes from north Carolina you know
least buy normal sugar coke! you have money for it!
I'd buy the new cheverolet camaro, it's not expensive to keep nor is it expensive itself.
What if I buy jewelry and return it after the hour would that work?
When Jake puralta popped up though
Just be a vegan and play tetris
If i have 100k $ . I would buy all existing beyblade .
g i f t  c a r d s
he is like the oprah of youtube
BUY GOLD?
How do you spend 100,000 in an hour?: pay my student loan debt.
Mr.Beast: "ok matpat heres 100k, you have 1 hour to spend it."

Matpat: "alright let me do my math and get my calculator."

Edit: Wowza thank you for 41 liKes
I gotta say, I freaking love this new game theory format
That‚Äôs epic but what about a theory on the true nature of SCP-001
Matpat better buy the thanos Corvette
Go to a gold bullion buy 100k worth of gold, gold only appreciate over time
i just noticed matpat has a inspirion 15 7000 yep i have one too
Me:byes like a million Pokemon cards and games
If Britain leaves the EU will we be restricted by article 13??
When I saw the thumbnail, I thought it was about the airsoft gun Apex legends
buy 100k in giftcards
Ayy the 5 euro from GTLive!
What about gold? It does go up in value over time.
Lmao everyone knows investments are way op.
My family is from North Carolina
What about gold and silver?
The problem is inflation
Or you could just spend all the money on gift cards for specific stores or Visa cards so technically you spent the money in the cards and you get to keep the money on the card
I'd rather do the other Mr. Beast challenge, the one where I'd get into an all out team airsoft battle against other people. It's a real bummer that the roster wasn't bigger, would've been cool to see MatPat duke it out with some awesome people
GAME THEORY MERCH
What about investing in gold
You could make the argument that buying electronics or other goods (while not the financially best option) are the most enjoyable, as you can play/use your purchase. Some people might get thousands of hours of use on their new iPhone or TV, so it might be worth it to them
0:23 look what comes out of his mouth
Was expecting MatPat to say Game Theory merch ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I know how I‚Äôll just pay off my student loans.

What about an instrument lmao
Why not bought 100grand worth of gold?
I would buy a bunch of good watches, wait 10-20 yrs, then sell them as they would be (hopefully) rare and expensive. I would also buy some watches that i like, so i can wear them
is it just me or did the intro get better
Wait matpat what about bitcoin?
Gold???????

Me Personally, I would by 3 New Monitors And a cool desk i can setup to Place them all Buy a good Camera for Face cams or something to show my buddy's my Beautiful (Not) Face a New computer, Keyboard and Mouse Because i have a Crap setup with a Logitech mouse.
so seems aids suggesting over 105%. has maths left you?
This was very disappointing
Rhett and Link are from North Carolina ü§î
Being vegan seems the best way
100k worth of SCRATCH TICKETS
Why not invest in precious metals? Gold and Silver are fairly stable.
Nobody:
No one:
Not a single soul:
MrBeast: You have 100,000$ and only an hour too spend it
Spend it on robux robux never goes down in price soo... EZ WIN
Personally, I would just Ron Swanson it and buy gold
What about gold because modern currency is based of the price of gold.
I was yelling: BUY STOCKS throughout the whole time. Who knew I was kind of wrong.
I added a step and thought of buying gold bars since they will keep their value but not go down, sell the gold bars after an hour, then think about which investments to invest in after an hour so im not making stressful decisions
I would just buy visa giftcards, but a lot of them
solid gold bullion and a safety deposit box
mat pat please make a fortnite lore theory please
Diamonds are actually worthless
better idea:  Buy a $100,000 check from a friend, so when you get the money back, you have unlimited time.
16:36 liquid gold-- piss?
Chandler.
I think you forget that most of the people watching this are 12 and have no idea what the heck you're saying. I still loved the video though
Mr. Beast is my favorite game
Buy a lambo
13:25 I KNEW IT
I would buy some robucc.
but people in this challenge dont care about making more money. they just want stuff they want.
If Artemis Fowl has taught me anything, GOLD. GOLD is the way to go.
Just Put It In The Bank. Problem Solved! Then You Can Spend It Anytime!
I mean electronics could work just look at the original red dead redemption
Also, isn't it technically 13k? because he did divide it among his friends....
Buy a 100k visa gift card like smh
Still waiting for a comment from mr.beast
S A L A M A N D E R S  A R E  N O T  R E P T I L E S

Why not buy gold/silver instead of diamonds? The markup is much less and it's generally considered a stable investment that will appreciate over time.
Hey matpat you know in the insanity ending in fnaf 5 there is that audio that plays and at the bottom it says some sort of code
I am from North Carolina
13:24 buy game theory merch with it
MatPat seems jealous that his wife is so excited about Mr. Beast XD
Hey Matt did you know that Mr.Beast is from North Carolina?!

MatPat, I gotta say, thank you so much for that shout out! =D
I wasn't expecting that... at all!
I'm glad you enjoyed my videos enough to do so, and just for the record, I like this new format!
Kirby isn't flying!
He's falling with style
Matpat: references drag

OG subscriber: nostalgia noise
Matpat: has science channel debunking games, shows, movies, and memes
Has not done a single science experiment
Science: Am I a joke to you?
I like green screen, but your editing before was amazing. I like the new ‚Äúformat,‚Äù but I think it should be used a bit less. I hope o don‚Äôt sound like a critic, but I hope my input can help your content continue to improve
It‚Äôs so weird that he has come out of his recording closet.
"Science is WoRkInG"
Maybe you should do more experiments, you seem to enjoy it
14:19 plz Netflix, don't create this monstrosity...
Matpat the new format was cool for a bit but can we go back to the old format, it was overall just more fun
xD I'm watching this after the James Charles thing happened so he's not exactly a successful youtuber so you can't say that MatPat xD
WHAT IS MATPAT DOUING OUT OF HIS RECORDING CUPBOARD/CLOSET!?

Please do a second part to the "Kirby is a God of Destruction" theory
Our science teacher shows us your videos in class, and trust me we all love it (I think?)
But I wanted to hear more about Kirby being a god of destruction ;-;
"Hopefully Science is just a little less controversial" global warming fades in "Oh no" is honestly such a mood
How is Kirby any different than Grand Zeno?

Both children.
Both have a large amount of power.
Just know you are now joining the noble ranks of other elite tubers like JaMeS cHaReLs
I love your new style so much üòç
i miss the old format, not that i have a problem with mat pat‚Äôs beautiful face but idk it feels weird an less game theory
He is a microbial ballon-ameoba God of Destruction‚ÄîYa that make sense
I really like seeing more of MatPat on screen. feels a bit more personable. I also enjoyed the live experiments. Great work!
Or maybe the atmosphere is just helium instead of air?!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I watched the other videos about Kirby but I still don't understand how dark matter is able to reincarnate after you kill it and if it is reborn after it dies in each fight, does that mean that your fighting the SAME dark matter each and every time? Because I thought Void Termina was the SOURCE of all dark matter. But is he the reincarnation of zero, 02,dark nebula, or what?
Kind of missed the photoshop Matpat. Could you maybe use real matpat for scenes like with the balloons, but photoshop matpat was used for everything else?
Copy others techniques? 

LE GASP

King Dedede=Kakashi Hatake confirmed!!!!!
Matt: Today we are switching gears from the lore of Kirby back to the science of Kirby, hopefully science is a just a little less controversial.
Me: What rock have you been living under?
Blah blah, yeah yeah Matpat say whatever you want about Kirby...
But you must make a video on how and why Kirby IS SO FRICKIN' CUTEEEEEEEEEE
I love this new editing style. Also, matpat is adorable, I think the humor shines through even more when he‚Äôs in screen
i actually prefer this format because its more expressive,but i miss the heavier editing of jokes as examples with punny images
actually europeans say "km/h" and not "kph"
Matpat:*talks about YouTube channels*
Me:ok
Matpat:*SAYS THAT JAMES CHARLES IS POPULAR*
Me:NOT ANYMORE * wHEEZE*
I won‚Äôt be surprised if Matpat finds a cure to cancer.
Kirby flaps his nubs like a bird flying confirmed!
He's obviously just copying the ability of the air
OOOORRRR maybe in Kirby's world, they don't breath in oxygen maybe they breathe HELIUM!
Where is badly edited matpat?
WHERE IS BADLY EDITED MATPAT???!?!?!?!?!??!
The SCIENCE! Of how Kirby can fly
MatPat's teeth are brilliantly white. I hadn't noticed this before and am now very envious.
I wanted to hear more about Kirby being a god of destruction :/
Awe that‚Äôs a bit of a bummer. But I‚Äôm not that knowledgeable of Kirby lore so if everyone else knows it.. oh well haha
What if Kirby just makes the air in his mouth helium?
When you wanted Kirby lore but you can‚Äôt ask since that would be rude
i was actually looking forward to part 2. i haven't had the chance to overthink kirby lol.
Nintendo: here have a cute stupid pink boi
Matpat: well actually that is a god of power and destruction
Nintendo: chuckles im in danger
I'm diggin the Bill Nye flare your trying üëç
The only intro song I never skip..
"Hey Game Theorists, MatPat here" That was definetely a VSauce reference! ‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢
I can't be the only one who noticed it
He's just using copying the air's ability
I love the new format of the game theory hes like the Bill Nye of youtube
I have those exact same Scissors... HE STOLE MY SCISSORS!
So he can float but that doesn't explain how he flies
That was more like how kirby falls. How does he ascend?
Good video, but I actually wanted to see part 2 of Kirby: The Destroyer God!
1900: prop planes
2000: jetplanes
2100: kirby
The longest skydive in history WAS NOT by Felix Baumgartner. He got beaten in 2014 by another guy.
You can even read about this on Baumgartners wikipedia page.
The guy who beats Baumgartner is called "Alan Eustace"
6:17 is it okay if I use that for a science fair?
Also, dedede had the ability to FLY since KIRBY‚Äôs ADVENTURE
This is so strange. Who is this person impersonating the Jpeg  known as MatPat?
Matpat bendy and the ink machine is back :3 but with a different name
Matpat:"...And instead a penguin, with existing biology."
Everyone:
Old Google news: Penguins have knees
Everyone:
Matpat:
I‚Äôll tell you.
Because HE'S KIRBY

My favourite smash character
Matpat: Most of you already knew about the lore
Me:Uh yeah, pft totally knewüòÖ nervous laughter
But if Kirby increased his volume to the point where his mass to volume ratio became less than his displacement of equivalent atmosphere he would begin floating
Matpat referencing wonder boy NICE
He small

He brawl

But most importantly

He love you all
How much force does Mario output to jump
I prefer photoshopped Matpat with the podium video style. 
This new style make you feel boring. :c
I still want to see that Evil Kirby part 2 video though
Gato means cat, Delgado means thin
That opening be like:
Hey VSauce
Michael here
He‚Äôs not flying....
He‚Äôs falling with style
Meanwhile, at Nintendo headquarters.... 


"Sir, we're busted..."
Damn your closet is huuuuuuge
I was missing animated MatPat until the balloon experiment. His reaction gave me joy.

By the way, not all of us are huge Kirby fans but we do like Kirby. I was fascinated by the last theory because I don‚Äôt know a lot about Kirby in general. üòê
Matpat the sphere is wrongs
its 4/3 pi r cubed
You didn't explain how he goes up though just how he slows his descent it's likely just the similar to an air gallon but still
I like the unnecessary green screen of his living room
but you dont explain the flapping creating the upward force?!?!?!
kirby used the power of belief
This was pretty cool but I thought he just converted air into helium. XD great work MatPat
But how does he go up?
I feel more comfortable with paper MatPat. Guess that's just a habit
Do more webcam work in ur theories it's more personal if u talk directly

Kirby is a balloon like jiggly puff I assume
Why can‚Äôt my science teacher just play this is it‚Äôs basically the same thing :D

And I just wanna watch game theory :D
MatPat should make another spin-off, called RealLifeTheories about conspiracy theories or something ^^
My friend said that he is not watching your uploads intell evil Kirby part2
The game theorists: Why does Kirby fly


Fans: Because he wants to
honestly I appreciate you taking the feedback we gave you last video. you gained my respect once again :-)
I have always wondered why he could fly.... 







xD
Matt- air has weight
Austin- E=mc squared, square root of velocity over mass times acceleration to the third
I got an ad about comunism
Who would win:
Gravity that holds everything all around the world down to the ground
Or
One pink boi
Dude you are missing the one of the best secret stories (Dont starve ) make a video about it please thats really interesting
Damm... i want to see Evil kirby part 2 ;[
Off topic but I just bought The Silver Eyes








Just wanted you too know
Matpat, the new bill nye
Matpat the science guy!
I actually wanted the second half of the Kirby theory :(

Maybe bring it back, MatPat???
I still don't understand how Kirby can jump multiple times though..
Hey matpat you ever thought about making a teachers edition where you go over the math that you use in theories
5:37
That moment when science fails you...



I know how science works don‚Äôt pester me about it,I wasn‚Äôt being literal!
Hey can one of you guys please talk about fallout
Listening to the community, shouting out a small youtuber, AND conducting a real science experiment? Well done!
Lol meteorz has gained 8k subs 
He went from 27k to 35k
Matpat: air has weight
Audience: visible confusion
When you said god of destruction I thought of beerus
OMG Yay MatPat finally got to make another video about drag!

... oh never mind.
On screen, in person Matpat is weiiiird. Like we went from Game theory to Bill Nye over night.
uM aCtUaLlY el gato is Spanish for cat
Science funded by politics will always be controversial.
I prefered the original editing - it was way more fun.
Mat, your excitement when the ballon experiment worked was absolutely adorable.
Matpat: * A lot of the Kirby community already knew this stuff *


Me: Wait, there is a Kirby community?
this episode feel refresing to watch... good job mat pat and also the team behind this video editing ... keep up the good work
Don't get me wrong,  I'm going to keep watching,  but in not crazy about the new format.  You keep doing you MatPat, just not thrilled with face cam.
I always wondered about one thing...... is the bros. attacks in superstar saga actually work? 
If so can it PHYSICALLY hurt mario or Luigi?

MatpatTechTips Intro
Me: Kirby, are you flying!?
Kirby: No, I'm falling, with style.
Great video! Although I liked GT more when it was illustrated by graphs and silly drawings rather than real life examples
9:41 SUOMI N√ÑHTY!!!
Torilla tavataan
Kirby doesn't fly.
He just can jump and make it seem like he's flying
MatPat: GOD I HATE POPPING BALLOONS
me: me too buddy, me too...
Kirby: flies

Matpat dressed like woody: ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS NOT FLYING, JUST FALLING WITH STYLE‚Äù
Has it ever occurs to you that kirby is just extremely beefed up....AMAZING theory by the way
I wanted to hear about Kirby the God of Destruction....

Also I prefer Static Image Matpat over Real Life Matpat. RLM is bizarre.
And now I'm going to watch criminal minds because you gave me Spencer Reed vibes... good video thx
Thanks for helping with my homework
I guess I never thought of mat as anything besides a mysterious voice that explains stuff to me
Good job Mat Pat, I really like you in the video hold time! Instead of just being a bird face, that you keep drawing over!
Air resistance can make him fall slowly, but not push him upward. It's easier for me to think that kirby can expand himself without changing the mass of air inside him, that way he can have a bigger volume with the same mass, thus lowering his density which gives him enough buoyancy to ascend. This can explain why he can't do it forever, having the strength to fight outside pressure to lower his density could be tiring, so after a while he has to rest, even if it is to breathe too.


Greetings from Chile!
He just falls with style...
No but seriously, you answered the question "why does he fall more slowly when inflated?" and not "why does he fly?"
As in, why can he gain potential energy by flapping his relatively miniscule limbs?
He may have drag force but how does he jump infinitely in the air
I was actually looking forward to his original theory for Kirby. The fandom has to calm down. Let Matpat be.
Achievement: who is the killer... 
Do simulacra..... Plz



Thanks! :D
Balloon: deflates
Matt: YES!
You better be glaaaaaaad you didnt finish the original concept because that legit looks like you were about to say "Kirby is some recarnation of Void termina"
OHMYGOD! MatPat when hes happy is just so,,,, pURE! :DDD it makes me so happy to see him happy! :D
I still want the 2nd part of: who's the richest game character in the world.
That is just a theory, a game theory




And I just watched 15 minutes of why a cartoon character can flyüòï
I do watch MeteorZ's What is Kirby Canon videos.
Aaw I liked the evil Kirby theory plz do pt.2
I think it took character to admit when an idea sort of tanks and it made me like you 1,000x more. Magic the Gathering theory ever be a possibility?
Noooo I love the lore theories and was genuinely waiting for Kirby lore part 2
This episode looks a bit different...

Edit: I don't want to sound mean, but I hate the new format! So, yeaaaaaaahhhhhh....
Hes actually half fish, half nubinub
thats why he goes up
I don't care please do a part two
MEGA
CHONK
where would Game Theory be without the crumpled paper background.
6:27 but are we sure Kirby is on Earth?
sees intro
Me: ...ugh dang it i really wanted to see the second half #IDCaboutflying #imnotbeingmeansorry
I'm liking the new style with Mat actually in the video. Looks a lot cleaner and I'm sure it's a lot easier on the editor. Definitely looking forward to this new style!
I've actually watch meteorzs' videos and I was so happy about the shoutout. Thanks Matpat for making my day!
Is it odd to anyone else that mat pat appears on screen now
I really appreciate you directing people towards Meteorz. I agree he's great.


Yeah, this is a lot more interesting than your previous theory. And you did a really good job breaking down physics to make it more generally accessible. Overall, good video :)
Easy.





Kirby is god
kirby isnt part of marvel universe canon tho. love the videos
MATPAT I NEED HELP
And your the math/science guy


Would quark-gluon plasma (which has a temp. Of 4-6 trillion¬∞C)
Be able to  tungsten?
Thermally I mean
matpat; the science of kirby


austin has left the chat
Thank you for referencing wind tunnel tests Matt patt. It does my heart good to hear people talking about the tests that we aerospace engineers do.
Although i agree with your reasoning i thought there might be a possibility that kirby's world's ( excuse my grammar) atmosphere consists of a high concentration of helium

Also im not actually a fan of kirby but i like your videos so if there is something in the game that proves this wrong I wouldn't know
my teach was gonna teach us about gravity, air, thrust, drag and all that fun stuff so thanks for the lesson!
Matpat i just wanna ask..
Are you Robin in the Teen Titans? Netflix
Cuz you talk and look like him. :D
"Game theorists, mat pat here" 




V-Sauce, is that u?
noooooooooooooo KIRBY!!!!!!
AAUUUUSSSSTIIIIIIIN, Matpat is doing your job,
This is like watching a good fun and fresh Bill Nye videoüíÄüòÇüòÇüò≠
But in order to double jump (bounce off air) you need to TAKE IN air at a precise moment
Walking, talking, and flying bubble gum with shoes
When did Game Theory become old VSauce3?
OML, IS KIRBY A BUBBLE!?!?!? Bubbles fall too... :3
What happened to animated matpat????? just asking because now you use a green screen
I think he fergot gravity on kirby him self and the plain thay live on in his calculation.
Correct me if he explained it but i didn't hear anything about that.
I liked the Kirby is a demon episode/theory. Can you still upload part 2??
Kirby weighs practically nothing b***
Ok massive missed point. Boyles Law. Namely the heat internal to Kirby vs atmospheric heat and pressures applied in Kirby vs atmospheric's. We see the same with hot air balloons in modern life. Think you jumped too far across except accounting for basic variables. Drag force is important but it is a minor impact factor in comparison, why the air balloon doenst have to worry about aerodynamics as much as a place etc. Hopefully this gets noticed :/
Love the more involved science practical, would love to see more of that style!
Mat: everyone thinks Kirby flies by inflating himself but he would actually make him heavier.SCIENCE IN ACTION
I love the content recently but I really miss the old paper backgrounds.
Aw man, I wanted the Kirby is a god theory.
As a Mech. Engineer, appreciate much the equations of drag
In the end, Kirby will consume all, entropy will take all, even Shaggy could not restrain or banish Kirby. Shaggy is now dead.
Listening to matpat made my brain hurt 
Algebra is my bad suit
This new format makes me think it's gonna be like:

"Game Theory, MatPat here"
I love seeing you in the new theory episodes MatPat :) You're still one of my favorites, love you guys!
So....no mention of buoyancy? I always thought that was how Kirby was able to stay in the air...
I actually just wanted to see your take on Kirby. It‚Äôs very unique and even though I don‚Äôt quite agree with it, I wanted to see your way of showing your ideas.
This is good too though
He is the real Sonic!!! ‚ÄùGoing  fast as the speed of sound‚Äù Said matpat, discovering that Sonic has a cover in the real world.
Gotta say, new style of vids has me eying that unsubscribe button
Still like you matpat
But stick with what works
Im glad my favorite Kirby theory youtuber got promotion from game theory meteors I've known his channel for a while now and that promotion he's gotten he honestly deserves
I just assumed the Kirby-world atmosphere was made of helium
The "Mega Chonk" next to Kirby made me laugh
Kirby: I can fly
Mat pat and woody: That‚Äôs not flying that‚Äôs falling with style.
I love how you go into a ton of science on this show my answer would be like uhmm the air is helium idc if technically that makes no sense JUST BELIEVE IT!!
Hey MayPat, don't get me wrong, it's nice to see you in the video but I liked the basic animations and cheesy puns format. For me it had more charm. Just a pointer ;)
YoU DiDnT uSe ThE sAmE cOlOr Of BaLoOn






just kidding, I really enjoyed the live action experiment you did to prove your theory. Keep doing it!
Please less green screen, more of the original Matpat on that one photoshopped image. The one with the stand and hands and stuff idk where it‚Äôs from. Still please go back
Awwww, I was really looking forward to the second part. Oh well, I hope you do get to it at some point.
I think that buoyancy was a greater factor than air resistance. He lowers his overal density by adding air to his volume and mass, and since air has greater volume at a lesser mass, the air tries harder to push underneath him, so he floats a bit.
Odd1sout James had your Merch on in Mr beats air soft royal put his on in a video
Can you do a theory on which "Tom Clancy" game is the most strongest?  Please and thank you.  Also love the vids
I feel like GT is finally changing for the better.
Kirby: Poyo!


Matpat: Die, foul Creature! throws scissors at Kirby. Kirby catches the scissors Oh no.
Face it MatPat, you only hate kirby because kirby drank all of your diet coke
Maybe Kirby flies by farting ü§£ü§£ü§£
What bout DENSITY? You know how ships are made of iron and are closed on the bottom? They float because of density, so he takes in a less dense substance and makes himself larger in order float.
I was looking forward to part 2. This was great, but I'd still love to see it.
Hey matpat, I see a lot of negativity on the new format. Although I do not think this format could work on all future videos, I see this working on videos with a focus on science. I like the Bill Nye The Science Guy vibes. Keep up the good work!
Thanks for going back to more scienc-y videos, they are sometimes a lot easier to take in than lore ones but I would recommend to only use green screen for specific parts of the video, (like the balloon experiment) and at the intro and outro...
It's great to see you more directly but it kinda takes you out of the action you know...
Anyways, amazing video, I really loved it!
I'm glad you got rid of the cheesy puns format! I also like the greenscreen, though the animation was nice too
I really appreciated the drag race reference, thank you MatPat
So you found out how Kirby and Triple De can descend. But what about the lift? I'm assuming that Kirby and Dedede are flapping their arms to increase body temperature (because Heat rises) and that's why they only rise when they flap their arms.
When MatPat goes: Oh No




We all know we're screwed
Hey game Game Theory could you try out a game called the witness the story may interest you. If it does have a story
i think you reversed your more than (>) and less than (<) signs in ur video today
What if he‚Äôs just absorbing the airs powers
Um, I prefer the old video format to be honest
Wait, but, I wanted the second half. :(
I always get offended by your Kirby videos >:(
BENDY 414 ERROR CODE: MATPAT NEEDS TO MAKE A THEORY. also, listen closely on the new bendy tape, you can hear matpat scream... oh no....
For the record. I didn‚Äôt know the lore. I played when I was very young and I appreciated the insight!
but would kirby flapping his nubs be enough to create enough lift to simulate flying and go higher
Damm, I don't play much Kirby so I was really looking forward to the rest of that theory. It was very interesting
You guys should do an episode on Aphmau's series Mystreet üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Surely the fact that intaking air does decrease density (despite increasing mass) is relevant?
Now you can remove James Charles from this video.
Is this Game Theory or Vsauce?
Matpat: The science... ....of Kirby...
Austin:MATPAT!!!!!!!
Matpat:What?
Austin: NO! THAT'S MY LINE!!!!
Now we just need a Bayonetta is Joker's mom theory XD
Although the poorly photoshopped podium mat was nice, I love having you in the frame at some points is better
That science experiment was so cool! üòÜ
MatPat is now bill nye the science guy
Boo those haters, I absolutely loved the Kirby god of destruction theory. Please finish it some day.
Yeah but how does kirby continue to propel hinself after the initial jump
Not going to lie, I'm super disappointed the Part 2 was scrapped, but I liked this too. So... Works for me.
Humanity gonna play smash every way possible before matpat uploads the 2nd part to the kirbo theory
Kirby equals a baby with a button to nuklear weapons? NiceüòÇ
>be a small pink fluff ball
>Matpat calls you the god of destruction
>cry
Don't worry MatPat, I l still learn from you!
It would seem like MatPat has had a new editor for a few days, maybe a few weeks now. Surprised that not very many people have seemed to have noticed it.
Until Now.
CARS, DRAG RACES, 2JZ. I know what he's talking about for once
I actually liked the theory then u CHANGED IT
Matpat what happend? You liked these couch talks so much yo started to do it on a regular basis? You certainly are showing your face more often...
why is everyone so mad at matpat?
I like this new format of having you in the video on top of the background
I thought about drag like 7 seconds before he mentioned it. I smart thru matpat
You should do a theory on Missingno and other glitches from the original Pok√©mon games
5:35 Really loved that moment of "give it a minute, it will work I swear" that everyone experienced in school experiments.
Proof of why he falls slower. Not of why he can fly. 
What's happening to this channel.
i love the fact he appreciates the km and kg system of measurments cuz honestly miles and pounds suck
When he was talking about stuff in 5:11 he the air was heavy 
BUT what it the air he was inhaling was helium
Kirby flies to much cuz she inhales then farts very hard.
Kirby: Sucks in air to fly
Dedede: Sucks in air to fly
Metaknight: fly's cause he's a badass
3:33 i think you know what i mean
Did you here that article 13 was approved
This is the theories I like science instead to lore good job Matpat
MatPat is slowly becoming the NewGen Bill Nye with this format! Only a matter of time...
I can see that this style of video makes you happier. I like it. Though really unexpected, keep doing it!
What if the air on kirby's planet was also mostly helium?
Just a thought because he's probably still a bit heavy to fly with just earth air
Hey Matpat can you do Bioshock I've been dying to know what that's all about.
Perhaps it has something to do with Kirby having a universe in him
wait this is now live action isn't it I just relised it at the end of the video (Ôºç‚Ä∏·Éö)
Man I‚Äôm early, I don‚Äôt have a quick mind to come up with something this early.. but hello.
Yay science!!!
But hey! It's just a theory, A GAME THEORY
Mat Pat You literally drew Kirby ON A balloon and started talking to yourself QUALITY CONTENT RIGHT THERE FOLKS
chandler wants to know your location
If MatPat was a doctor 
Patient: Will I die soon 

MatPat: Most likely but hey that's just a theory a doctor theory
the new format makes t feel like he's bill nye or something
what is if he had an mechanism inside him that heats the air?üî•üå¨
reads title
What a completely random question that I never asked anyone and never planned to but still want to know the answer to because it's random.
yall shoot in front of a green screen now? I love your content!  First video I've seen in this style though and I got to say you should stick with what made you great
MatPat, I love the idea of putting yourself in the videos, but could you do it in scenes like the science experiment or like you in front of a whiteboard doing math? I would love to see the photoshopped MatPat at his podium explaining the physics of something AND you doing an experiment to back up the explanation in your videos. Just a request, opinion, and a little advice.

-PJ
What if kerbys world is made of helium (sorry for miss spelling
I love the style of this video (mostly because your real form is in it)!
Did Matpat just give us the whole of the 2nd part of Why we shouldn't  trust Kirby in the span of 1 minute? I'm loving this new format.
Help CDawgVA the copyright system doesn't work
When did MatPat become Bill Nye? It works surprisingly well.
You should‚Äôve drew Kirby‚Äôs face on the pink balloon, MatPat
"That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!"
This channel is the only time I'll tolerate math. üëç‚ù§
can you please do the theory of cubone being an unlit charmander üôèüèº
Who else misses the old Matpat placeholder?  No offense Matpat üíñ
I was really looking forward to part two but no people had to complain thanks jerks
Can you do a video on Links ability to parry even Calamity Gannon with his shield, as well as stop a charging Linel in less than a half second in BOTW?
I wanted more lore! Lore is my favorite part!
Did i miss something or did Matpat forget about how Kirby and Dedede still can rise after their initial jump, ya drag slows their descent but it doesn't explain how they continue to go up
I kind of want to hear about Kirby, the god of destruction
Pls bring back photoshoped Matpat, Real life matpat is ok but not the same
but how does he continuously ascend. u know like double jump ad triple and quadruple and all.
I prefer the old format, Mat.

You don‚Äôt just get rid of 2D Mat!
14:28 i screamed when he did that
How dare you call your science experiment crappy Matpat. You clearly had fun, and making science fun makes it approachable which is the heart of this channel's origins.

So yeah man, your experiment rocked, you rock, new format is great worry not. You do you mate.
3:17 Delgado is Spanish for thin not cat lol
Why is it Game Theory has LIVE Matpat but Film Theory has PHOTOSHOP Matpat
Do a theory on yoshi‚Äôs smiley flower and how they might be drugs
Heh I loved that intro!
I wanted to hear more about Kirby being the reincarnation of a GOD OF DESTRUCTION.üòî
The surface area of his bottom would not be a circle. But rather a Hemisphere. Which would be 2 * pi * r^2.
This has been intro to aerodynamics with MatPat
One punch man season 2 is out so wait until he ( might) go all out so you can make a film theory on him
Even though haven't you thought about that he ducks air to increase inner space in his body so the trapped air will go up which will carry Kirby ship engineers use this method so the ship floats in water
Damn, it must be exhausting trying to satisfy everyone all the time. I just watched Pewd's video about a petition held against him and how tired he is about all these claims. And now I just watched the intro to your video and you as well trying to cope with that. It's kind of sad. Great work man, I enjoy your videos and think they're fun.
i think he also releases tiny amounts of air from the bottom and the top to help him move forward and up
More video game lore videos and less video game science videos, more THEORYS. Also was looking forward to part 2 of kurby. Still cool video though
or he's just copying the air's ability of being super light
I was waiting for you to explain how Kirby gains upward force midair. It presents the same problem double jumping does. You explained drag, cool, where does his thrust come from?
Its neat to see MatPat on camera and not just curled up in his closet reading.
Alright Matt - now you need to do a theory on the Calypso Twins of Borderlands 3.
im learning more than school does that mean i should quit school and just game theory videos all day?
big fan
MATPAT!!! i would go to school if you were my math teacher
Wait then how does he gain altitude every time he flaps his hands ?? because its only his body (the belly section) that increases in surface area and his small hands cant really push him up so shouldn't Kirby only be able to fall slowly rather than be able to continuously gain altitude
I am only in Year 8 So I am not that great at science
who else wants mat pat as there science teacher?
You should make a theory on hollow knight
noooooooooooooo science
I'm not done watching the video but,what if Kirby's world is different than ours? Wouldn't the air be different? Idk
Editing is a bit different. With him being actualy in it
Man. I was really looking forward to more information about Evil Kirby. Like it was a sequel to the Evil Mario series, my personal favorite Game Theory. Oh well.
He is less dense
where have the complex vids gone? this is trivial
Dont temp Netflix they already ruined Death Note 14:19
Mattfat Should Talk About The Mother Series. Let's CopyPasta This All over GT!!!
When he jumped up and said hey, I thought he was going to say "vSauce" after that.
This new format is weird
Can you not be on screen 24/7
make a theory about mario's true name because mario and luigi are the mario bros, so luigi's name is luigi mario, what is nicknamed jumpman's true name?
I was actually quite invested in the whole "God of Destruction" thing. Shame, that.
Golden  freddy's name is Cassidy I got this by goggle
Sekiro: Shadows die Twice?
I like this mixture of live clips and traditional voice over.
I DONT CARE KIRBY IS MAH MAIN IN SMASH ULTIMATE!
Game theory: how does kirvy fly?


Fans:




      He ‚Äúcancels‚Äù gravity duh.
Felix Baumgartner's record skydive was broken in 2014 by Alan Eustace. Irrelevant to the Kirby bit, but c'mon research team, check your stuff!
You should do a team up with Diana the Physics Girl or Derek from Veritasium. Those guys do really cool experiments.
Wait I didn‚Äôt hear about this lore wait tell me
No one has ever done a dark sonic analysis and I was wondering if you could whip one up for the sonic fandom please?
So idk if I perfect the new style of the older style of video but definitely keep the mini experiments and demonstrations.
We ain‚Äôt need school we got MatPat
Instead of showing THAT drag, you should have just showed another picture of shane
When I saw the experiment, I
 thought of Bill Nye






Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Nye the science guy
I kind of miss all the animations but I did enjoy the science experiment
Or maybe Kirby is just really warm inside, so when he inhales air it pushes him up...?

BUT HEY! THAT'S JUST A THEORY!
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND PHYSICS!
So part 2 of that Kirby therory got cancelled?
But how would Kirby push the air out from underneath himself to acend upwards? Surely those small nubs don't have more or equal surface area if himself in total. This means he shouldn't be able to go upü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
Matpat, you made most fans more mad by only doing a part 1
Hey MatPat, I noticed on an old ds game(Solatorobo: Red the Hunter) that they are using crystals to power up ships and machines. I wonder how powerful was the crystal in the game? 
(Note that the crystal in-game is not the same size as the one in your former theory about chaos emeralds.)
Kirby don't fly but he gives BIG SUCC
I liked the old format of game theory. I don't mind seeing matpat, its just that I feel like that sort of thing is best left for gt live.
I am thinking about making a game theorists discord reply to me through my dm's in discord my name is TheFoxyslayer47 and my friend number is #4443
One Word Matpat: Petscop
MatPat: everyone and their mother knows the Kirby lore no need for another episode on it

Me (knowing nothing about Kirby lore): pffffttt duhhhh everyone knows
Actually you only told us how kirby falls slower when big, you didnt say anything about how he flies upwards...
Is matpat wearing makeup? It‚Äôs really nice tho üòÖüòÖ
I liked it more when he wasn‚Äôt talking to the camera
can someone timestamp the moment he held the Kirby balloon next to his face? :")
Y'all vetter hop on to ma boy Meter oz!
I enjoyed the content, but I'm not really liking the new video format
I just wanted to say I really enjoyed part one. I always love seeing your take on things even if I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the theory. So keep up the good work MatPat
The kirby community =/= your fans. Yes, I'm sure there's plenty of overlap. But some of us really wanted to see what you were going to say...

I honestly don't care why kirby can fly. I want to hear about this ancient destroyer god. Guess I'll go check out this Meteorz person everyone's mentioning...
Yo math wiz lev 99 aka matpat do you think you could do some analysis on hacker Dillon's claim wether it holds truth or not it would  make u  a digital surlock  Holmes aka bitlock Holmes
James Charlie died
Plot twist the air Kirby breaths has a high helium content which would explain why Kirby's voice is squeaky
what if the atmosphere has more helium than oxygen?
king dedede learned to fly just by watching kirby do it and said "Hey I want to do that"
It's possible that where Kirby lives, the atmosphere is made of helium
Kirby is a MONSTROSITY THAT CAN CAUSE CHAOS TO THE WORLD
I was really waiting in the part 2.... I love the lore theories
new editing style, not sure how i feel about it yet. we shall have to see. :)
I want you to do don‚Äôt trust Kirby part 2
I think i am speaking for most THATS A REALLY COOL JACKET i kinda want it
I'd love to see Kirby the Threat Pt. 2...
Mat: Here's part 1 of a theory

Some of y'all: Let an entire fandom riff on him without saying anything

Mat: Alright then here's something else

Some of y'all: Oh noooo, how could this happen? I liked part 1 and wanted part 2, part 2 pls :((((
Us:MAT! WE DON‚ÄôT DO SCIENCE!
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOooOoOooOOonoooooo

the controversy is taking over

- president sheeve palpatine
Hey matpat can you please make a theory about Detroit become human?
This was uploaded on my birthday! How!?
I love how MatPat is turning into Bill Nye.
For the record, I really enjoy the new format! Great video, guys!!
Hey Mat love your work, and what you do. I just wanted to say I feel as though the new format isn't working for me. I'm only putting out my opinion and I'm not saying you should change it. You do you and I'll still watch your vids, I'm just putting my opinion out there.
Completely unrelated to this video just saw your instagram post, you were at the sulhpur springs in st.lucia (like a few steps from my home) hope you guys enjoyed your vacation
@1028 I moved my legs at the ex... who really cares?!? I enjoyed this episode! Kirby will end the world... you wait!
I don‚Äôt know about others saying they weren‚Äôt happy with the Kirby theory but I was really excited for the second part
No matpat please do kirby part 2
5:37 matpat watching as a ballon proves him wrong
Then you have forgotten about The King Of Random
Nice video but it would have been great if you had calculated the difference on falling speed of inflated and regular Kirby and estimate the drag coefficient of dream land. Maybe we could even know the viscosity of its atmosphere!
"Sentient balloon man"  is probably the best description of Kirby I have ever heard
Ok I still want to hear about destructive god kirby
I might be in the minority here but I really like your new format, MatPat. It makes it more personal.
I LOVE the way you made this video with the experiment and instead of the picture of you you always use we could see you and it was way better than the usual(and that is really hard to do)
Yo MatPat? You gonna credit all the fandom wikis you got your info from?
Request for video, Explanation of Plants vs Zombies
Can we pls do a PVZ theory
Kinda sad,I didn't care about flight  and am about to get my flight test back lol,now i do
wow... Live action...
7:57 






 

 
You forgot to answer the question... HOW DOES KIRBY GAIN LIFT IN MIDAIR????
YmVuZHkgYW5kIHRoZSBkYXJrIHJldml2YWwg
Well kirby is from popstar and that atmosphere is probably different
Kirby flies when Kirby flies
lmao you showed > 20mph instead of < 20mph
So like, can we get less video of Matpat, and more stock images of Matpat badly photoshopped into situations?
You should look at kleptoCats it has some dark stuff in there.....üò∂
You should do a video on how HM slaves work in pokemon.
Intro to as very! :)
I love this new format

I thought you said "Hey Gay Theorists!) huh...
I'm really liking the new format, Mat. I've always liked your more personal content because i like getting to know you, your struggles, and the way you just want everyone else on this platform to not have to live in absolute misery. And getting to see you in every video helps me connect these videos to those videos, and it's nice. :)
I did not expect that slow motion ‚Äúoh noooo‚Äù I laughing so hard at that for some reason
ATTENTION MATPAT! BENDY AND THE DARK REVIVAL! I WANT A THEORY ON THE TRAILER PLEEEEEAAASSE!
You are literally the only person in the world that can make me watch 15 minutes full of math and NOT make me fall asleep after the first three seconds. So great job!
I want to compliment the Theorists on this new video format, but I'm probably too late and they're making episodes the old way
I have to admit I was liking the real life experiment
Can u make a video about ‚Äúwho‚Äôs the strongest sans‚Äù
Do another theory on the binding of Isaac
Film theory: How does Carl's house fly in Up?
We dont know what the air on planet popstar is. It could be helium
Make a new vid about bendy and the dark reveal. Please.
Delgado means skinny
gato means cat
But you didn't explain how flapping his nublettes enables him to ascend... Now I'm curious!
"If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an ABSOLUTE certainty."
Matpat vs Kirby, in theaters this fall.
Kirby is my favorite character.
Little sad we didn't get to see the original second part, but I'm glad you at least linked us to a place where we can find that information!
Hey Dude, can you make a thory of how nova IS or IS OF STAR DREAMS OWN kind. OR how Morpho knight is one of meta knights scrach skins!
But isn‚Äôt  the density of the air in the balloon same as the outside? And when the balloon is deflated, won‚Äôt the center of gravity change? I dunno, I‚Äôm not good at science, but I have a feeling that the experiment is not proving much.. well, this doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the video. Anyone agree?

Edit: I‚Äôm only liking my own comment to get more people to see it
There‚Äôs lots of negativity on this new format, but I personally think it‚Äôs really cool and has lots of potential! It‚Äôs kinda refreshing and gives me some Bill Nye vibes~ Good work to you and the rest of the team!
I am not used to this editing style, it‚Äôs a bit choppy.
I love this format! You are less prone to use uncredited arts and it's just seem more effort from you instead of lumping it all to editors
üòÇüòÇ science since 6th grade
Bro, Kirby first of all DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HALTMANN. He invaded Kirby's planet, so Kirby stopped him. When Haltmann inadvertantly fused with Star Dream, Star Dream tried to destroy every organism in the Universe. Kirby had NO CHOICE BUT TO KILL HALTMANN, who was too far gone anyway.
From a Kirby fan, you should totally still gover some Lore in the Kirby series.
Okay so that's how he falls more slowly... but how does he rise?
hey MatPat loved your video especially the green screen
I love Kirby. Its funny that Kirby‚Äôs adventure is a very easy game, until the final boss rush. Most insane difficulty spike ever...
Can you make theory about herobrine
BY ALL KNOWN LAWS OF AVIATION, THE KIRBY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FLY


EDIT: HOLY CRAP, THIS IS THE MOST LIKES I'VE EVER HAD, THANKS GUYS. i couldn't resist making this comment and i did not expect so many likes, its good though. :D
The science experiment was such a cool little addition and you should totally do it more often, you definitely seemed like you had a bunch of fun doing it
He just farts very powerfully
But how dose he keep going up when he is already in the air and you click to go up he keeps going and when you stop he starts to sink so how dose he keep going up?
I liked the evil Kirby thing. Oh well.
Interesting new style of video! More on camera time than voice over.  it's new, different, and might take some time adjusted to it. Only time will tell.
That Kirby in a test tube was so cute!
Loved the format of this video, it‚Äôs fun to see your face for once üòÇ
THEN IF YOU ADD HELIUM , WHY DOES IT GO UP
damn this is a drag.... xDDDD
I'm skeptical that the drag is enough to explain the size of this effect to be honest. My own personal theory is that Kirby is filled with the fires of hell, which makes the air warm up and expand.
Maybe you could do a sonic theory   about Is the shrinking ray in sonic mania
How does a evil god of war fly? I fixed your title!
Since MK11 is coming out, can you do a mortal Kombat video?
you sad sad man
But I really wanted a part 2 üò° 

Good video by the way
U might become a video game üéÆ tewcher
He‚Äôs the new bill nye üíôüíÄ
That only explains how he is not falling faster than he is, but it doesn't explain why he can actually fly .. Falling (even when falling slower) doesn't mean you can flap your arms and then go further up ..
MatPat ,uh, sorry to bring you more psychological torment, but The Meatly just dropped a new teaser for the next Bendy game. So, uh, wish you luck ;)
‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs talk about the science!‚Äù

Can you do another theory with PBG
I prefer the old matpat videos, i miss Ronnie :(
#RIP #Ronniebesteditor #Butta
So you know how matpat dissected evidence to find out wheather or not pyro from tf2 is a boy or a girl I want matpat to do that for bloodhound from apex legends
Yey thanks. I was annoyed that you u were portraying kirby as evil but love ur vids so i kept watching while feeling sad. Anywae. Love the science part
Pfffffft.





He has powers u could have made a 5 sec video explaining it
stop blowing kirby
me: wow, great video!
matpat: (pops kirby)
me:
me: YOU SHALL NOT BE FORGIVEN FOR YOUR SINS
More than 3 weeks later and Meteorz gained more than 9k subs, nice MatPat, I haven't heard about him but it sure is nice to see you helping smaller content creators üòä
Baumgartner is not the number one anymore!
Hi I have some interesting things to say. Listen to Nightmare Freddy‚Äôs Nightmare Chica‚Äôs
And Toy Chica‚Äôs Lines when they kill you they talk about the one you shouldn‚Äôt of killed. Can you look into that please.
Wait wait wait.
How the hell did that guy go 853 miles an hour? 
The terminal velocity of a human is only 53 m/s (about 195 m/h)
Mattpatt, you sure you read your script right?
Matpat please do a theory on Yoshi's flutter, because it just doesn't make any sense on how a dense dino can wiggle his legs and gain lift. ü§î
13:11 oh so beautiful
Be my science teacher please lol
Can you do another zoo level mystery video?
DO MORE KIRBY MATPAT!
That's actually really noble of you to give a shoutout to Meteorz like that. Good on you
Dude MatPat do Duck season
where is the vid on mirage??
Do an episode on the deadliest Final smash in smash ultimate!!!!!
Don't even get us started on Waddle Dee's infinite jumps.
I genuinely wanted to see Kirby Lore #2. This is okay too I guess.
Mat You need a TV show in Discovery science hahaha your theory where actually good and worth learning
kirby gay confirmed
This respond how he goes down, not how he goes up :( I still wondering how he goes up.
NO WE NEED PART 2
MatPat: Kirby flies because he can increase his drag.
Me, an intellectual: Kirby flies because he can increase his buoyancy.
Is the opening theme available for purchase as a ringtone because I‚Äôd very much like to have it as a ringtone.
Imagine speeding up the dialouge because it takes to long to do math
matt. we have a new problem in the Kirby verse. morpho knight and the orange butterfly
What about the upward drag keeping Kirb from pushing up?
‚ÄúGod Of Destruction‚Äù
There are many other aspects of Kirby lore that are less controversial. Like the ancients or if meta knight is a Kirby.
His body causes a chemical reaction that turns air into helium. Theory solved.
I love this new forMAT
OG theorist here, this equation is still less complicated than that rocket science episode!
oh damn, I was actually looking forward to seeing the Kirby lore
4:55 Yeah, you're right here. And that was a good experiment. Buuuut you haven't count Archimedes' principle which says for floating object: mg=œÅgV, where m is mass of an object (Kirby here), g is gravity of Earth, œÅ is air density and V is volume of an object (Kirby). So, using that we can count:
m=m1+m2, where m1 is mass of Kirby, m2 is mass of inhaled air
m1+m2=œÅV
Density is defined as œÅ=m/V, where m and V is mass and volume of air, respectively
So we can convert it into this:
m1+m2=m/V[air] * V [Kirby]
(m1+m2)/V[Kirby] = m/V [air]
So density of Kirby should be the same as density of air only to float and it should be smaller for Kirby to fly.
That sounds impossible to do but when Kirby gets a bit of mass as air, it expands a lot. So his density becomes smaller and he could fly only using Archimedes' force.
Buuuut there's another point. Kirby needs to heat inhaled air so it will have smaller density. But to do this almost instantly as in the game, he needs to have something like a very good heater inside his body... Which would be pretty strange.
And that's how hot air ballons are flying and ships are swiming (but without heating).
And also you have the best thory channle, so I came here.
Gato is Spanish for cat el gato is Spanish for THE cat
But what propels him up when he inhales? Does the inhalation of air do that
What physics classes teach you: increase surface area = increased drag force = increased descent time.
What Game Theory teaches you: Don't give MatPat scissors.
Kirby lore is actually quite well documented it is interesting
*mass
I liked the old style of game theory better where it was fun animations and not you talking
The Kirby games have some really really dark things in it... but you do have to dig into the games and not a lot of people do. I'd say also go to WoolieVersus on YouTube and watch his Kirby stuff, too.
Honestly, I'm super proud of you. Even with lots of unhappy complaints, you handled it very maturely. And I personally find it very honorable when someone drops something instead of stubbornly sticking to it. 
I mean, I've known that more was pointing to Kirby being an eldritch God rencarnation thing for months, but still, it could've been a nice recap or somthing. 
Anywho, I really love this video. It's more interacting and interesting, it looks like you had fun! Thank you!
Why is this so entertaining üòÇüòÇ
So MatPat says penguins can fly if they train
Do a theory  on zalcus the flamingo channel
Aerospace engineer here. You showed the drag equation that ignores skin friction. And one that assumed a large enough Reynold's number to create turbulence behind Kirby, which is not super likely as speeds that low.
A missed opportunity:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not flying. I‚Äôm falling... with STYLE!!!‚Äù
I kinda liked the evil Kirby theory no lie...
8:30 a friens said it's unrealistic that in smash bros characters have different fall speeds as every falls at the same speed. I said; "in a vacuum" and that's all i needed to say. at least it should have been, i did have to say air resistance is a thing right after cause they still didn't understand =b
(Shits pants)
Thats how
You didn‚Äôt quite explain how Kirby flies you described how he floats. If Kirby were to fly he would have to apply more force than gravitational pull of Kirby‚Äôs planet with his nubblies and feet. And from what I saw of Kirby flying I don‚Äôt think Kirby could.
Basically every theory:

How does this happen?





It doesn‚Äôt.
Science of the twomp.
is that an endgame sweater?
Yeah Fon bowling ball by air is MUCH less than F on bowling ball by EE (entire earth), while Fon feather by air~Fon bowling ball by air, but Fon feather by EE is MUCH less than Fon bowling ball by EE
Golden freddy is called yellobearü§£
It could also be because he heats up the air in his body. Take the balloon example again, however look at it as a hot air balloon this time. As the air heats up he goes higher and as it cools down he sinks. This could explain why he starts to sweat, as his body is heating up. This could also explain why he does damage as he exhales; hot air.
Um Kirby destroyed haltmann because he went batshit crazy
Okay, now we need a theory on what kinda training dOing Dedede would of gone through to copy kirby's flying and succ succ.
I love your series, I suggest Danganronpa if you wish to make a rather dark episode full of MURDER. Or, Mystic Messenger. It's interesting, and the character Saryoung Choi/ 707 is very self aware.
Guess who has a green screen now!!
KIRBY WE"RE FLYING!
No, We are FALLING WITH STYLE!
Didn‚Äôt he just explain why Kirby falls slower? I don‚Äôt think I understood where he explained where Kirby got his lift from. How does Kirby get the extra vertical when he puffs up?
What about density, if Kirby had more volume and not that much more mass wouldn't that decrease his density?
Please do a part 2, at least for the people that care..like myself lol
MatPat: (after an entire explanation about balloons and air) Kirby flaps his nubs to gain height<

(Anyone who doesn't pay attention): But why does he fly???
14:30 Grown man stabs a small, innocent child, with a pair of scissors after watch the movie "Us".

Star Allies and Hard are not allowed in the same sentence without a negative somewhere in between.
I really liked the old format. It made it feel personal. This feels like a high priced infomercial. Back to the old format, please!
I dont know how to feel about this new style with the green screen, i love it but it really different but i still love most of your theories
10:00 seems like the editor mixed up > and <
#JusticeforCDawg
How much strenght is behind Kirby air bullet
Preferred his old type of vids
Me when I see the title:




Kirby can fly?
METEORZ-SENPAI!!!
Good theory, but had to dislike because of the change in editing. What were you THINKING Patrick?
Confirm. Matt Patt is this generation of bill nye the science guy
You‚Äôd obviously know if you read the manga smh
Hey Matpat, how does sonic do that spindash thing
Do a game theory on dark deception
This really reminded me of the old bill nye vhs tapes
I actually thought that the other theory was so much fun I‚Äôm really sad that you are not continuing it ü•∫ü•∫
Can u go back to the style you always use ;-;
No Mat Kirby doesnt fly he.......
That‚Äôs just a Theory A Gaaame Theory
I like your new format
4:54-5:25 sure that‚Äôs how you‚Äôd explain it to an alien
The air turns in to helium
Matpat‚Äôs science segment made me think of Bill Nye.
I thought Kirby could fly because he puffs up air and slaps his arms why
kirby can fly because he farts out the air
At 10:00 and 10:08 you got the "greater than" and "less than" signs mixed up
I'm a little late to the party but I really enjoyed this video
That explains his falling. But how does it explain him continuing to rise with his floaty jumps.
Man it's also density
no crap crap crap crap i need evil kirby part 2
Next you should do a don't starve theory on how wes infaltes ballons and makes them float with his lungs alone.
I liked the last theory
I like the new format. It feels fresh, but not super different to me. It still feels like MatPat.
science is working
Market used the wrong inequality he used greater than when he said it was less than 20mph 9:40
Right when he said Hey! The first words to come up into my brain is Hey! Vsauce, Micheal here!
I played kirby dream land my old nintendo
What if Kirby can fly because he/she/whatever heats up the air inside him, and flies like a hot air ballon
GO CHECK OUT JOEY DREW STUDIOS, BENDY AND THE DARK REVIVAL
I don't mind the shift in format since this was more of a hands-on lab episode, but I miss the crazily stretched around photoshop animations I normally get. Other than my "change is bad and scary in spite of the high quality and great work that went into it!" reaction there, though, fun episode. :-)
Don't really like the vlog approach to these videos, just feels awkward watching you talk with your hands
Is there a posibility that the air is full of nitrogen
Matpat: epic ending of a video
 pops balloon 
Gets scared throws down scissors almost stabs his foot

Jason behind the camera: someone get this kid a juice box
for the LONGEST time i was trying to figure out why matts name was SO familiar...then it showed up in my recommendeds: "matt and pat, theyre friends who play together, learning and sharing and junk, best friends play together"
Y WOULD U DO THAT TO THE PUFF?????
He's a balloon
there's a  certain ink demon coming back to town at the beginning of this year and he's going to be making one hell of a dark revival to the series.
You say the air has weight but Kirby sucks things to take their powers what if he's stealing the airs power
I really like the body cam theories
THATS JUST A THEORY
Who wants a Fire Emblem theory?
Man I was waiting for part 2
Matpat: the science of kirby
Me(internally): HEY, ITS MEEEE, AUUSTIN!!!
he just uses his copy ability on the air
Maybe over here in Britain üá¨üáß we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have proper measurements‚Äù. At least our English is proper
While I was gone MatPat started green screening?
He's not flying..(Put's on glasses) he's falling with style.
Game theorists: how does Kirby fly

Nobody:

Me: KOWALSKI ANALYSIS
for those wondering why the balloon letting out air only rose up once all the air was let out, it‚Äôs because the air flowing out of the balloon produced a force down (bc the air was leaving through the top)
Tell me about mincraft hell
Mat is handsome
You should be a teacher
MatPat is like the Bill Nye of You Tube
10:08 Sonic wants to know your location
I actually rather liked this style of video. Makes it more genuine. At least, that's what it feels like. If you do more like this I would love that. But if you went back to the original style, I wouldn't mind that either.
Do a theory on subnatica
what exactly was that intro matpat?
Sigh...I was looking forward to the lore part 2 theory.
So you're telling me if I were falling from an airplane without a parachute, I should hold my breath and spread my limbs out?
I wish nintendo makes an amazing mirror remake
Wondering how much kirby weighs and how much force each flap needs to lift kirby up.
Game Theory Question:How much can Villiger carry?I mean he can carry a lot.Like whole sharks
"Science is working! Science is in action, ladies and gentlemen!" üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
You should take a look at Please Dont Touch Anything VR
The new format is great, breathing some new life into the content. When MatPat goofs it makes me smile.
(he's a baloon)...or a amioon
Am I the only one who doesn't feel like his answer is satisfactory? Sure, we know he descends slowly, but how does he STAY in the air? How hard/fast is he swinging his nubblies?
I liked the theory, but to me, this proved how Kirby floats longer, but not how he can flap through the air and keep a steady flight. This didn‚Äôt prove how Kirby can actually fly in the air. Really liked it though!
Game theory. Where would you go if you fell in the back of a yugioh card ?
He makes the air turn into helium.
But how does Kirby climb in altitude seemingly indefinitely? Might be a a big hole there..... um..... "New Bill Nye"?
MY BRAIN HURTS 10:52
A Science Episode???!!! 

WITHOUT AUSTIN!!!???

MATPAT??!! Right On you My Dude,  was Looking forward to part 2, but This is Good 2!
I WASN‚ÄôT MAD
Matpat this doesn't account for how he moves upwards post jump. You didn't address the actual flying, just the slow falling
I really like the change in style. I'm an electronic media major in school rn and I am geekin'
Go to Scott coffin channel for clues
Never thought I would see MatPat blowoing kirby
Can you do red dead redemption who is the strange man
custom definition of "weigh", huh...
if he's only Falling Slowly and not flying then how does he get up in the sky in the first place !!!
matpat is getting cringy bring back podium mat pls
But wait does Kirby have enough surface area and strength on his nublets to propel him up? They seem pretty small.
Yes but how does he generate lift
I dont like this new real matpat thing
I like the new bill nye matpat.
I prefer the more informational theories
MatPat I love u but this video feels really awkward when we were looking at each other because most of the time when you talk to us face to face, it‚Äôs always serious so every time I saw u you gave me that feeling of when ur not in trouble but u still have to talk about ur actions
also that why it's heavy beacuse of the air is carbon dioxide also hot right
so instead of kirby shouldn't be trusted, we're back to "what is a kirby"
I like the new format, but to please everyone I feel like you shouldn't use it every single time. Just some. Then do the old format.
Hey game theory
I have another theory for you
It is about fnaf
It shows that there are TWO marionettes
Turn on lefty and the marionette and let the marionette and lefty in your room
Let lefty kill you and you will see the marionette in lefty, but also in your office behind lefty
Which marionette is real?
he doesn't fly >:(
it's called falling with style
Hey mat, i suggets a theory on the scp foundation, a certain character has intrigued me. conner an immortal man from episodes on youtube Lord Bung, his name is conner, it indicates that hes the scarlet king or the reincarnation of him.
If Kirby was able to somehow not Inhale every part of the air, rather just certain parts for example Helium or only Oxygen, could he eventually float like that?
Does anyone realizes that his intro was the same as beekeepertoby
ƒ∞ thought he copied airs flying power
I'd just like to take a moment to express my genuine appreciation for you & what you do. I love your content, it's so fun & informative to watch. I wish the best for you. Thanks for being. You're cool.
I have a theory that has nothing to do with Kirby but I don't know where else to post it..  What if one punch man is in the same universe as Mob Psycho 100?  Siatama could be a strength esper?  Also there is literally a girl with psychic powers in the hero association.  Also both shows were made by the same person.  Idk this just seems possible to me.
I really prefer the old format more
Not feeling this one overall.
P U F F is how Kirby flies.
Matpat is the new Bill Nye.
Change my mind.
So the real question is can kirby give the good succ
Hey! Can you do a theory on if the song A VERY SCARY CHRISTMAS could really happen? Also they mentioned you in the song.
Maybe air is a copy ability and thats why he can fly
C‚Äômon i knew that meme
Matt. Please dont change up how you do your videos just because some butt hurt youtube commenters are complaining. Please I love your channel so much and how you do everything. But if this is how you want to do things then ill accept that and still watch your videos!
See now THIS is why I watch Game Theory. I really hope you're going this direction in future videos. Back to science, back to basics.
It makes me so happy to think of Matt pat putting together this whole wood frame just for a balloon demonstration to help us understand :D
Looked like he got flung up lel 0:00
0:22 Kirby‚Äôs got some mini shields
MatPat: How does Kirby fly???? 

Me: Masahiro Sakurai wanted his game to be easy so he gave him the ability to fly.
I drag race in a jr dragster so does my sister
Neutral time
Didn't u people know that All Kirby GAMES ALL LINKED and DARK?
Oh, you've redecorated...! I don't like it.
Love the new format
11m subs dammm son
Dedede is actually supposed to be an eagle. Fun fact.
I'm surprised mahopac never told anyone that he was in death battle
What if it was helium
What... What about a vid about me? Spyro... The cuddly purple draggy everyone loves? I bet there are theories about me. And if you do make a vid about me. Can my comment be in it?
You know you‚Äôve been watching too much game theorists when you start reading all of the comments in Matpat‚Äôs voice... help
Likening the new video layour
What happened to the old style on GT 
I'm not hating, I just miss it.
Figured it out, the atmosphere is made up of multiple different "airs" he just sucks up the helium in it so he can float, theory busted.
Old format please
the old editing is way better
Love the new setup, Matpat!
Please The Lore Part 2 I was really into it...Come On...i need to hear that theory...GIVE ME/US the THEORY...the LORE THEORY
Matpat you always amase me with science and a theory which is very amazing for a fourth grader who has watched you when you had hmmm I think seven million subs
MattPatt the science guy
HOW IS DELGADO CAT IN SPANISH? IT MEANS SLIM/THIN. CAT IS GATO AHAHAHHAHAHA
mat i dont know if u found out about the fnaf 2 tralier in back werds u can hear children talking about mike
I like the new presentation style
all you did was explain how he would fall slower not move higher into the air??
edit: not hating just stating something that bugged me <3
YAAAAAAAAAAY no more making kirry a monster
Kirby has a frickin endless void for a stomach, of course he's dangerous.
What's the music at the beginning?
Kirby is as strong as beerus 14:30
10:00 HOW GODDAMN DARE YOU MATPAT, YOU'VE REALLY CROSSED THE LINE THIS TIME


That 'greater than' sign should be the other way around.


 and so should that one.
i am truly greg
Am I the only one that thinks Matpat would be a great lawyer?
Damn, alas kirby, mat knew him
He inhale air to fly that‚Äôs it no need for a 15 minuet video
Well..Kirby is just kirby..
0:30 pause................ HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA new MEMME
But density
I dont know about any one else but I would sit and watch a 20 min video on matpat talking about any subject in science
Nobody talking about Kirby being an amazing vacuum cleaner?
What about Kirby‚Äôs eyes? I‚Äôve never seen an amoeba! (Then again, I haven‚Äôt gone over a,oebas in school.
Me after watching this video:
Me: I wanna fly too!
Me: * Sucks in some air and "flaps" my hands *
Me: Why isn't this working...
Nooooooo I wanted evil kirby
I like the new style for these videos
MatPat: how does Kirby fly?

Me: cough cough floats cough cough
I honestly think no one would be mad at you for any of your videos
i like this new recording format, it‚Äôs much more genuine and human-like. keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! üíñ you‚Äôre awesome
1:30 didn't think global warming could kill people in that way, but of course it can.
Wait are you still making that part 2 about kirby being a god of destruction?(I liked ur first part by the way, great analysis)
I remember that the kid head got hurt but I actually thing he Is golden freddy because he has no bone there now and golden freddy has no entoskeloton
Kinda want the part 2 still
You shud do a theory on pony island
PHYSICS, BABEY
MatPat = Bill Nye confirmed?
Kirby could also just be inhaling helium and that causes him to rise up and then letting that go allows him to fall, I know the manual says he takes in air but I don‚Äôt think Sakurai had a full scientific explanation for Kirby‚Äôs flight when he made the first few games
0:02 I swear he said ‚Äúheyyyy gay theorists‚Äù
Are you aware of borderlands 3
I wish he could do a Mystic messenger theory
I like the science experement and live-action additions to this episode! You should totally do more like this
Shut up kirby uses his own air to fly
My first thing that came to mind was Kirby sucking some form of nitrogen from the air, at a certain extent
I like the new Style :D
Matpat the science guy.
Please go to the old format
Enter The Gungeon Theory?
Big Kirbus
Big Kirbus
I actually really liked this video matpat! It had some really good science and it was a great game theory. Thank you so much for putting a lot of time into this video!
It's not flying. It's falling with style!
I got your popsocket
MatPat that's not flying that's falling with style
This was a pretty good video, it seems like the editing and production quality has been improving lately with the green screening and things like the balloon experiment. I thought that the actual science was pretty simple as opposed to some other videos and I predicted it myself already but it was still enjoyable.
-Some asshole on the internet
Is it just me or is MatPat wearing makeup? Either that or he has a flawless skin routine lol
I dont want to be rude but new bendy game
Wow, the beginning of this just goes to show Matt is a gosh darn genius, when it comes to YouTube, but there still is alot he gets wrong in videos like the chunlee Street fighter video where he thinks humans have 2 left or right legs, or math in others. But seriously the best you would get from a different YouTuber would be the follow through not caring or just drop it all together, good on you my dude. Definitely earned some well deserved respect I'm sure.
Well, what if Kirby can pop? Why does he have a mouth but he or she cannot talk?
Aw man. Why didn't you calculate if the reduced fall apeed chechs out with the increased surface area. Also, if it is not enough you could calculate how much he would need to heat the air inside him.
"We're switching to the SCIENCE of Kirby."

Carmen starts playing

Dear MatPat,

HI! ITS ME! AUSTIN...
So he gains altitude by??

(Love seeing more of MatPat on-screen aaaah)
Rip Kirby 14:24 that's a disgrace to me cuz my Images has Kirby
Anyone notice that the Kirby sprite from Kirby Super Star is kind of purple?
But how does Kirby actually gain height? This only shows how he falls slower.
matpat would be a really good science teacher.... like if u agree...
Mat pat=greatest human child
1:25 yo who stuck Kirby in a science thingy
Galileo or newton
Jelly filled doughnuts...
Simple. Kirby don‚Äôt breathe oxygen, he breathes helium.
Kirby is like a bird he flaps his arms to fly. But he decreases his weight by inhaling the air (which it could be full of helium.. since it's a different planet.) And expanding his body. Honestly it was kinda simple to explain. But what do I know. I don't overcomplicate everything that has an answer
14:25 cringe XD
Theres a new/old sumting sumting of Isaac now, it's afterbirth, I guess. It's for switch
make theory about FarCry5
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working!‚Äù
That was adorable how
excited he was
10:00 ‚Äúless than‚Äù...
Matpat Fortnite metoar is getting faster
Awww I really wanted a part 2
he is trying to hard to be bill nye but I still love ya
Without even seeing the video I know the answer already.
How does Kirby fly?...
Yes
I‚Äôve done this experiment in my school
You should be a teacher mat pat
Should have stuck with the original plan for the death God thing. This feels like a a science project I would do with my 4 year old. Game theory shouldn't cover elementary physics as a whole episode, there are children's science channels for that.
I'm late.
aw i wanted part 2,,, email me it jsksksk
Okay, but how does he actually ascend?  You said yourself that he ascends on the third button press.  Are we just assuming it's the same "physics" that so many platformers use for double jumping?  Or is he taking in new air so that he can expel some air for propulsion?
Well that was a drag
Um I wanted the part 2 more
Can you make a theory on terraria please
I always laugh when you say ‚Äúnubblies‚Äù üëåüëåüëåüëålol
do an fnaf video  the next day and I like kirby
You know Spanish?!!!
He doesn‚Äôt.He hovers
Now im more upset
Have you been watching vsauce recently? This video breaks the usual format and goes a bit vsauce. I like it. I have been on a crazy vsauce binge lately. And I was just thinking about how you are kinda like a vsauce for gaming.  And the week that I first start watching vsauce is the episode where you start with a vsauce reference. Scary coincidence. Loved the video keep it up.
Saying science isn't controversial is controversial.
But how does he go up? No wings, only tiny, somewhat aerodynamic nubblies!!!
I really liked the lore theory!
Hey MatPat, some cases really needs to be closed by an awesome dude and the only one I could think of is you, Please keep in mind of Who would win, Saitama vs Goku, Hulk, Superman so I can hear the fans shut their mouths, And honestly I am sorry for adding a stressful work to you, But also thank you for the hard work you are giving just to keep this community alive, Peace out
It‚Äôs really nice that you shouted out Meteorz in this, he really deserves more, so good job!

I think it is about the air having helium in it
3:19 Delgado is not cat in Spanish its gato
Oh nooooooo
Kirby is the true villain of Smash Ultimate
I‚Äôll be honest, the entire first half of the video before Matt started talking about drag, I was yelling ‚Äúbuoyancy!‚Äù 
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, and maybe drag is much more of a factor, but an inflated balloon is more buoyant in air than a deflated balloon because of the fact that air is so light. If you filled a balloon with the same plasticy material that the outside of it is made out of, it would sink. 
The logistics of buoyancy is that if an object, in water, weighs less than the water it displaces, it will float to the top of the water. More, and it sinks. Inflatable objects like life jackets float in water because they are less dense than the water‚Äî there is less mass in more volume, as to say that it takes up a lot of space but doesn‚Äôt weigh much. Inflated balloons are very similar. Most of their volume is air, which has about the same density as the air around the balloon. Basically, there isn‚Äôt enough buoyant force to make the balloon fly upwards‚Äî like one filled with helium would‚Äî but there is enough of a buoyant force so that it sinks slowly. Air doesn‚Äôt sink in air (not considering differences in heat or whatnot) so a balloon filled with air doesn‚Äôt sink quickly in air.
I really enjoy the science experiments, I like MatPat with a body
MatPat as a drag race judge?????
Petscop 17 is out. You should do a theory on it. ( Edit: So is 18 on the same day?)
I would like another kirby lore video
Nubblies... 2:50
Just when the lore was getting interesting, most people have to ruin it for the minority of people who want to here the lore (specifically those who dont have access to play kirby games)
What‚Äôs the music you played on 7:11
It's Kience
I wanted to see part 2 of the kirby theory :(
I didn't agree with matpat, but I was still excited to hear what he would've said!
Just as a thought for a Theory; How much power does Samas Aran's suit hold, produce, and expel and does said suit cause negative effects (such as radiation or other maladies on her body). Please don't judge me to hard as Metroid is one of my childhood games and would like a little science to the Beautiful Bad-@** Bouncy Bounty Hunter.
At 8:56 I thought... he creates a vacuum around him
Ok that ending was funny Mat Pat and I do actually like Kirby I think he is cute comment here if you agree like above me with your own opinion ok, ok.
Although it would not be entertaining, you could have said 'air resistance' and ended the video. I mean, I'm pretty sure most of us knew what air resistance was anyway.
Always love Sundays for a good ol'game theory :)
He is a mutated slime
Wow, you really dropped the proverbial ball this time Matt. You explained how Kirby slowly descends, but that doesn't explain how he FLYS. I do not care how many times he flaps his little nubblies, there is no way he can achieve thrust.
Question, how does Kirby flapping his arms let him go up? Those nubs aren't wings, so they cannot increase his altitude! Will there be a sequel to this theory explaining this or no?
I really don't get why everyone has been hating so much on Matpat recently. I guess it's just that they hate us cause they ain't us
So, You could say that... he‚Äôs full of hot air?

I‚Äôll see myself out
MATPAT JOEY DREW RELEASED A VIDEO
Lol wouldnt kirby be as light as air if he sucks air because when kirby eats something he turns into it.
mmmm no... i did not finish this video because of this new editing style... dont like it... go back to game theory please.
I like the new mat pat on screen
I was looking forward to the second part of the theory. Guess I'll never know now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Don‚Äôt cry. Craft
I don't know how you do this
You couldve taken into account the buoyancy force, but really cool vid :)
When did Matthew decide to do more live action and showing himself? That was a real shock to me.
Bruh what the hell, screw these people I wanted to destructor kirby video- MAKE IT ANYWAYS dont let your hard work be trashed someone will still appreciate your effort man(even if I'm alone idc). MAKE IT MATPAT!!
SCISSOR SAFETY MATPAT
Bill Nye the science guy...... BIIIIIIILLL BIIIILLLL BIIIILLLL (matpat) BIIIIIL
Too much human in this episode :P
At 10:00 and 10:08 the incorrect less than and greater than signs are used lol
really loving this more dynamic style of game theory. feels more engaging. keep it up, matpat. anything to appease the youtube algorithm.
What about how he can ascend
Mat... dont give in... do what you love...
Delgado is spanish for slim
10:05 pay attention to the TV... You'll notice something are my there.
I love game theory, don't get me wrong. But not sure I'm a big fan of the green screen matpat.
Not a proof, just an explanation :P
We have now know how he calls faster but how does he go up
Before watching why is can he fly even tho he is heavier i think because the air isn‚Äôt a part of his body and when he moves his hand he isn‚Äôt actually moving it its his body moving and then making his hand move the actual thing he is pushing the air, when air  small things in it ( i forgot what its called im awake at 1am don‚Äôt judge me) move more it becomes hot and go upwards so the air in his mouth making him fly
Delgado means skinny
Can confirm "del gato" means Cat's as "of the cat" in spanish.
Great video matpat you're awesome
THE AIR IS HELIUM
Could you do super hero theory?
i had a deja vu after watching this ep
HONESTLY you should make whatever vids u want i wish i got 2 kirby vids this week
I like the science experiment. More science
majin buu
Alright. But how does he push himself In the air. He has to propose himself one way or another. Waggling his arms surely can't be enough right ?
Why is he talking about Felix Baumgartner wasn't there already a guy with more money that jumped from even higher already years ago?
I really dont like that change of style...

You dont get that GT vibe/essence going from animation/photoshop to green screen live action :/ 

It was distracting the whole time...
time to dededie
i think he is inhaling helium because he is not on earth
What is this video? It literally asks a question as if it is wrong then gives the same answer that is already given and explains what drag is which we all know and shows how it works- this was made for 5 year olds!
What if he has a organ that turns oxygen into helium
This is my favorite game theory. I love the experiment, I love how you showed matpat, I love the jokes, and I just love how you did this. Be proud!
Kirby is not flying he's falling with grace
I like the old format
Make a slender man theory
Who are you and what have you done to mat pat. Where is he... WhERe iS HeeeE!!!!!
Kirby: Flys
Matpat: well ACTUALLY...
Another awesome theory
Is Matt pat gunning to be the next bill nye the science guy?
Matpat I need a answer so in sister location custom night there's a voice that says "take me with you"and it doesn't sound like any of the other voices whose is it it can't be Bonett because her voice is too high pitched and ballora's is to neutral and I don't think it's babys so whose is it?
Matpat the batman of the game verse
I like the new layout of matpat being irl in the video. Mat is really good at presentation and can make videos like this almost as fluid as his photoshopped self. Good job matpat! Keep doing what your doing!
Yay Kirby got stabbed
Because he's a balloon. End video.
Why is photoshop pat gone
So hey, just because we already know, it doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt want to hear you talk about it, even if our universal agreeance disagrees with your ideas and theories. I really wanted to see that theory to completion, but do as you will, tis not my place to decide what you do.
Kirby is perfect cell CONFIRMED
I just watched a pepsi commercial in order to watch this vid. Im sorry matpat
Please stop blasting Kirby
Science!!!!!
0:26 to
MatPat: Surprisingly, Kirby has deep lore.
Me: First time?


Honestly, great theory.  I love your work, keep it up!
Thought he said hey gay theorists
I think you should do a theory on krunker.io, as it may seem like a random gun game if you actually shoot in the air on the subzero map, you hit the roof with your bullet, maybe my computer glitched, but I at least think you should research it.
YOUR A FAN OF DRAG RACE TOO!!!!!
Nubblies
MatPat turned from his own style in his channel into Mcgyver
Did I miss the part where he explained how Kirby flies? The whole inflate thing was explaining how he falls slower.
Where's Austin?????
I always just assumed he was heated up the air he swallowed with his body heat, and was just light enough to overcome gravity like a hot air balloon
She brakes the laws of physics
The new format is great and all, but I just want to go back for it to be some funny video just or messing around. This new format seems to serious, it feels like im in a science class
He‚Äôs chubby
theatre theorists should be a thing
The answer is simple: the air is helium...
*MatPat shoutouts MeteorZ*

THANK YOU SO FREAKING MUCH
Great now please explain how waddle dee does it
Please stop using green screen mat pay instead of photoshopped podium mat pat, your literally killing it
But when Kirby inhales something, it goes into another dimension. So what happens to the air?
Please finish the theory
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one sad about there being no part 2. I love all your work, but lore videos are my favorite. Still, you are the best, and I'm always excited to get a notification from Game Theory.
Then why does Kirby loose air the longer he is in the air?
wraith is slone from titan fall 2
Kirby is a Bee case closed
But Matpat!! You forgot about buoyancy. Archimedes states that warmer air is LESS dense so ,assuming Kirby is a warm-blooded organism, Kirby would take in air, his body would heat said air therefore making it less dense. This would IN THEORY allow Kirby to float, once he passed a certain threshold (that perhaps you could delve into detail about in a video=}).
Wait.... doesn‚Äôt that just prove why he floats back to earth slower when he‚Äôs big? Like if you press jump more he floats height, and even if he gets larger it doesn‚Äôt make him go higher... right?... or I‚Äôm missing something? Idk
I‚Äôd still love to hear more about the original theory you were writing. It was super interesting!!!
You are a hero!
Omg üòÇ
Can you please use less of the green screen and go back to your older format of editing? I think this was one of the greatest strengths of the channel. I don't mean this in a mean way but I think this is a step in the wrong direction.
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt like the new.. seeing pat in the videos? Not trying to be mean it‚Äôs just.. so odd and feels off.
PLEASE DO A THEORY ON THE SIMS? LIKE THE LANGUAGE THEYRE SPEAKING OR LIKE HOW ITS A REPRESENTATION OF HOW WE COULD BE IN A SIMULATION
Crysis theory plz
wow, Kirby is like a balloon? You don't say Sherlock.
that explains how he can fall slower but how is he flying?
I enjoyed the lore
How can he jump in mid air i mean its logic that he falls slower.
But how can he gain hight by swinging up and down his nublies?
I really appreciate the live action Matpat
was this video way too silent?
Make theory of epic mickey
Are the animation guys on vacation or something?
How about a theory on the true nature of SCP-001
While Kirby doesn't get lighter when he inhales air, he does get less dense as the expands
Im a big fan kirby
at 12:53 i thout i sped up the video or something. Heh
I'm not really happy with this decision. All the intro did is make me want to see that theory even more.

EDIT: I want to say though I'm really happy you gave meteorz a shout-out, because his channel needs more love and care. Thank you for that, Matt.
and in sister location tralier
The air on Planet Popstar is a lot cleaner then Earth.
i like the new real matpat
Why does kirby go up tho
I would honestly have loved to see part 2 of that theory. Hope it still comes.
the killer is out
But how can he go up after in being in the air
But hey that‚Äôs just a theory a game theory
9:40 ok im unsubscribed now. silently starts crying
I miss the old style
I know others have stated the lore already, but matpat has a way of telling things. Because let's be honest we aren't here just for the facts we're here for the personality of MatPat so I kinda am disappointed that he won't continue. Also it bugs me that it's part 1 with no other parts to continue the thread of thought.
thank you
Wait is matpat green screening instead of just a bunch of cringy cutouts? Yeah boi.
What if he Sucks Air out of his People he Ate and uses the air to float
I want a part 2 üò°
BAD GREN SCREEN
What if, he got a "filter" which lets him filter the helium out of the air? That would make him fly. or?
Have you ever thought about the buoyancy force of Kirby due to collecting air
Hmmm, why does this format remind me of Vsauce3? Tbh I prefer the old format, but if this is what you wanna do, I'll support yaüíú
Whoa dang you basically went over something  anyone in high school  or older should know
matpat is the new bill ney the science guy..
MatPat has become too memey
I actually enjoyed the lore episode. Its when you focuse on stuff like doki doki or expired fnaf is when i have a proble. What happend to you mat? Please do another mario lore video please? Or a science vid with out austin. I subscribed to shoddy cast for austins content. I subscribed to you for stuff like comunist mario or sonic not being fast or avgn mental issues.
Anybody else miss when MatPat showed up as a still image that moved around and had changing eyes instead of live action
Theis is a answer to youer questions plant pop star has gas for air ok ps please give me a shot out DDgamer pss you forgot abot the gravete

But most importantly

You should do a little inferno episodes
11:50, way to breath no breath
Why do you not animate any more
How do he get up
MatPat: Plays a game
MatPat: Has a theory
Sakurai: "...And?"
Wait inside of Kirby is a universe right? So where does the air go
Last time you took this long with a part 2 you realized how wrong you were. Oh wait..
Am I the only one who thinks Matt is wearing make up? Like foundation or something?
BRING BACK THE OLD FORMAT
As you said ‚Äúless than 20 MPH‚Äù you put up a graphic that indicated ‚Äúgreater than 20 MPH.‚Äù
I from burma
still doesn't explain how Kirby is able to propel himself upwards only the means to descend at a slower rate.
You should really check that
So about fnaf if you used merch fron doki doki cant u do the same for Fnaf check your self mat pat (btw I am ten and saw this error lol).
Hey Mat Pat the new way your doing your videos is really cool keep doing a great job üëç
Guys let‚Äôs just appreciate how much matpat puts in to these theory‚Äôs,heck I learned stuffs I need for school here
So inhaling air explains how kriby falls slowly, but how does he fly? Do his stubbly arms let him fly? Am I missing something?
Wow that's cool!
Do a theory on the lore of FilthyFrank.
What is with this new video style? I like the old one way more. Its funnier.
Where‚Äôs the demon Kirby theories!?why did you do a video on a stupid challenge instead of another demon Kirby video!
OMG the siren at 1:30 made me think there was a siren in real life cause I live in Israel and that's pretty often here(the start is really similar).
That's not flying, it's falling with style!!
Yeah, but how does he go UP?
Awe I was really looking forward to the second part of the theory. Who cares if all thr Kirby fans already know? Alright bye. Don't need to watch that particular video. 

I loved this video tho and I am loving this new video formatüíñ
Do a terraria theory
In England we use MPH, why do Americans think we use KPH?
14:24 that‚Äôs the happiest ending I ever watched ;)
But how does he flap up
You didn't complete the theory- you say how he DESCENDS slowly. How does he ASCEND though?
Damn, no wonder you were so excited about Kirby games, I thought Nintendo had dumbed down Kirby to be much more kid-friendly...but it would seem that I have been judging it only by how cute and innocent it looked in recent titles...
Wow! He‚Äôs just proved that air has weight!!!!!!!!!!!
I greatly appreciate you making videos. I, just for some reason, feel that you arent happy doing this anymore.
It is just helium?
The real question is where does the thing he ests go example eats a chipmunk where does it go and jow is kirby still in the same shape.
I hate the new format long live the old one
I like this new style! Here's hoping he sticks with it.
Good video, but a little dumbed down
While the new format is indeed sort of weird...
I love those Kirby flying animations with the controller, that's some quality!
No! I want lore!
I really didn't like that episode. I would have loved to see the second half of the threat theory. And I also don't like it that MatPat appears now himself. It was incredibly distracting to listen to. I have the feeling that he tries to keep his program fresh but he moves more and more from the original idea.
Hmmm. Still doesn't explain how he ascends in mid air. You just explained how he falls slower. Also. The new delivery feels odd. I personally don't like it. The old one was unique to Game Theory this one is too common. It doesn't make the show stand out from the others any more. I only criticize cause I love you guys. Been subscribed for years. I just think you been slipping lately. I don't want to loose you. I really adore this channel. It's my favorite on YouTube.
too
I preferred the previous format, is this because of article 13?
Let me marry matpat
I find it strange that I understand everything he's saying but at the same time not at all
Susie was the daughter that he was looking for in Planet Robobot
This is a channel where Austin's videos go into concepts like relativity and geometry, then MatPat thinks it worth spending 10 minutes explaining that adding mass creates more weight and falling objects are slowed by air resistance. Plus the editor doesn't know the difference between less than and greater than symbols. C'mon guys, this is weak.
Speaking for everyone. KIRBY LORE PART 2
RIP old game theory
save yourself from the new editing before it‚Äôs too late matpat
I love kirby so much 
also snoopy moomin sesame street
wally the green monster
but number 1 is hashem!
Quick question I bought your merch and I didn‚Äôt get a pin can you look at that cause that pin looks pretty cool so I was just wondering what happened

Edit:My mom bought both chaos merch
Is it just me or did he just explain why he falls slower and not why he flies..... coz Kirby acc gains elevation rather than just fall after jumping!
On the offchance someone involved reads this: I actually enjoy the live bits. Nice step up in the production value overall
I kind of like live-action science teacher MatPat
That little balloon experiment really made me appreciate this new style of doing videos. Keep it up
9:10
insert absurd JoJo reference
Wait, did you even cover how he propels himself upward after he's off the ground??? What if he also is in a different(lighter) gas?
Felix Baumgartner's world record was broken by Alan Eustace. Hardly anybody talks about it because it wasn't financed by Red Bull.
My game theory socks just arrived üòÄ
I really enjoyed the last Kirby episode.
I liked your new style! But I don't think doubling Kirby's surface area would really make him fall that much slower, so it doesn't seem to match with actual video game physics, but I think the principal is correct
Can you do a theory about "Fran Bow"
Can you please make a Game Theory game or a Game Theory VR
As physics teacher and i can just argue against your experiment. The Ballonmaterial compresses the air, giving it a denser mass of air. This means, that more air coincides with a bigger weight. The preassure isnt directly correlated with the amount of air in the Ballon - notice that it is hardest to push air into the Ballon at the start and at the end. This means the Ballon (with its air) is the densest, when its either nearly full or nearly empty. So basicly your result is right, the way of explaining it is a tiny bit flawed. If the Weight of air was the Matter, then the air surrounding us must also be accounted for. This means, taking water as an example: a ball of water in a waterbasin is "floating", because it has the same density as the surrounding water. But if u take something more denser (i.e. water at 4¬∞C) it sinks, or something less dense (Ice) it floats. 

So Density is the key Component here. Nice Job anyway.
Kirby isn't flying, he is falling with style.
Hey matpat what are the shield potions in fortnite made of?
So Bill Nye the Matt pat guy
I did not know you were my science teacher
After the Kirby theory. Can you do cappy's true origin (from mario odassy)
This one will take a while but...
How overpowered is Spongebob Squarepants? He can teleport and it doesn't stop there!
It's not about the air adding mass to Kirby or the balloon, that alone wouldn't change anything because they are also surrounded by air.
It's about the air being slightly compressed inside Kirby or the balloon, which makes it denser than the surrounding air, so it drops further down to earth.
Also, isn't Kirby's effective area for the drag force a half-sphere rather than a circle?
This shows how he falls slowly... but how does he go up when inflated??
Also, did that prove that the Earth is flat or round?
I like the new editing! With the video and not the creepy photoshopped pictures of you
I was saying "Boourns" to your other Kirby theory..... maybe someday we'll get the rest.
Matpat's first words
Mat: H-h-h
Mum: awe his first words! It's hi!
Mat: HELLO INTERNET, WELCOME TO GAME THEORY
I like the way matpat is becoming more interactive
now you will never make part2
Not a big fan of the on screen mat format
If Kirby couldn't copy in the first game then the real question is how he learned to do so
So in the new mortal kombat , casie cage fatality that she kicks her opponent in the gust and separates her opponent‚Äôs spinal cord and skull from the rest of the body. Now how strong does the kick have to be lmao to do that üòÇ
Hey Matt I know this is off of the vid but play the sister location trailer backwards it says something weired.
Kirby is acting actually more like a flying squirrel.
Please do more science-based theories. Please do more science experiments in your videos. I like that you appear in front of the screen in your video. I enjoy your science theories the most. I also enjoy the math in your science theories.
HMneHMe I miss the old format.
is it just me or does he sound a bit weird around 13:00?
I didn't know he was a god of distruction
I was watching a political video and cringing until I saw this
This made my day
I'm not use to having MatPat being on screen all the time ;-;
The editor never learned how greater/less-than signs worked, apparently...
i wanted to hear how kirby was evil plz finish your last theory
You killed
Kirby
This is formatted like an old Bill Nye episode
The fysics is working
some one should turn nyepat to a meme
Stay off the screen...
Love the new green screen video's
i like the experiment style matpat üòÇ
Omg Mat, such big mood towards the end. And wow his personality is practically identical to that of mine, what-with over analysing things just for fun and to prove people wrong. Oh and also to ruin people‚Äôs childhood.
Love the theoreyyyyyyy
Well... i know how he falls slowly now but i still don't understand how he floats higher with each breath.
del gato = of the cat...
I prefer the old kind of videos
He‚Äôs not flying, he‚Äôs falling with style
What if Kirby can convert air to Helium, or cold air to hot air? (Hot air weighs less than cold air.) Similar to  how we convert Oxygen to CO2.
Do a yoshi theory
In conclusion: Kirby's a balloon
Hey MatPat


I think you should do a theory on a game called OMORI
You had to support the games Kickstarter to play it, but I believe there‚Äôs some kind deeper meaning for it. I say at least check it out
ITS COMING A NEW BENDY WATCH THE TRAILER
MEGA CHONK
Can you do a theory on who is Really Mijora‚Äôs mask?
LOL matpat. I've never seen someone get excited over a science experiment... I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL
he could be copying the ably of air to fly
I actually liked how MatPat appears randomly throughout this theory, great work!
Yay a Kirby episode!
Hey MatPat, love your vids! One question: can Kirby actually generate enough lift when blown up to actually raise himself higher in the air?
I mean you explained why he can float slower, not how he makes himself fly higher.
#FollowupEpisodeIdea ;)
Wow on-screen MatPat is just weird...
Maybe Kirby turned the air into helium
Back to the Lord Kirby is beerus
Matpat the science guy <3
Hey vsauce Michael here !
Matpat plz go to your gravity falls film theory, i have a good theory
That wasn't flying! That was just... falling with style!
Mattpat used < for more than and > for less than, the wrong damn way round
0:11 context is important
Something really bothers me in this episode: drag has much less to do with the ability to fly than you make it seem. Yes, it slows the descent of a body in a liquid or gas, but also slows his other movement, since it always works in the opposite direction of the movement. In addition, drag really doesn‚Äôt affect a moving body too much until the area get‚Äôs really large and the velocity quite high. Lastly, there‚Äòs the much more obvious case to make for Kirby inflating his body: doing so in order to reduce relative density, since it‚Äôs a well-understood phenomenon, being the reason hot air balloons and airships float in the air or why boats float on water. On top of that, it‚Äòs also much more approachable for non-scientists than ‚Äûthere‚Äòs the formula, but I won‚Äòt get into details because it‚Äòs complicated‚Äú, since you can get into detail and crunch numbers pretty easily with the >>Specific Gravity=Density_Kirby/Density_Air<< formula.

All in all, it seemed like a kinda low-effort or badly-researched episode science-wise, which is kinda disappointing when that‚Äòs 70% of that episode.
Hey matpat, I want you to go over a topic that you have never done in your life of theorizing. I was looking on ROBLOX and I found a pretty interesting game called Flashback, I played it when it first came out and currently is on update 2 or 3, idk. But by the first update of the game, it had a dark side to it. It had a restaurant in the middle of the map and was closed. There was a latter and when you climb it, you find a helipad with a dead body on it. Right behind it there is a black guy with red eyes. The restaurant was connected to a shack via a pathway. The shack was locked up and had a blood puddle right in front. U couldn‚Äôt get inside. To me it was like the game was hiding up something BIG. The next update had the restaurant open and the bodie was still there but the mystery man was gone. The shack was still locked but there was no more blood stain. The door in front to enter the shack was locked but this time, there was a key. When you opened the door you found a person crying on the floor. He did not talk to you, he just sat there. The third update had the restaurant closed on eve again but when you boot up the game u find a cop car. When you climb up the latter, u find 2 cops investigating the scene. The shack is now completely open and inside, no more person, just a key. The same key to open the door. When you go to the back of the restaurant, you find the mystery man speaking gibberish. That‚Äôs where the game left off. Please do a theory on it, I wanna see what it is about
But... I was expecting the second half... >:v
Kirby ripped off MegaMan/Rogue with power stealing. More or less
I see what you did with the experiment by making the balloon with more air pink like Kirby lol üëå
Ok, the in-person style isn't bad, (really nice for the announcements) but it feels like not having the photo-shop takes away part of the show's personality.   If nothing else give us a slow change instead of shocking us all.   :)
Just remember Math is Fun when you're killing Nintendo characters
Even though I know that felix jumped higher I, still want to bring awareness to Joe kittinger who jumped lower but in the 60s, just wanted to say.
Ok but like... How does he go up? What you've talked about isn't flying. It's falling with style!
I would argue that you proved he can fall slowly rather than fly. You didnt work out the force exerted by his 'wings' to create the uplift to fly xD
why is the volume so low??
Wish we had seen part 2 as originally intended, but I recognize that Mat has to cater to the wider audience
Honestly I haven‚Äôt caught up with your videos lately because I‚Äôve unfortunately been busy with work but I‚Äôm happy to see you physically describing your videos unlike your previous videos. Hope all is well Mat!
Have you noticed that there is a fredbear plush in  springtrap/william afton's office in the sister location custom night because I think that yes the line I will put you back together is said by william afton but through fredbear!
Someone skydived from space
#kirby
wow, really nice ep, i‚Äôve semi-dropped the original show, but this is straight to the core of game theory, barely click-bait, and √©nfasis on a niche/small thing that can be used as a fun excuse to look into the science and extra facts of the franchise.       Austin was/is giving that too, this is a more chill and light, there is a distinction to be had, and i like it.

(oh, and im not saying Austin needs to be the screaming/ nervous/meltdown guy, but he‚Äôs certainly the more ‚Äúenergetic‚Äù one[and maybe the more ‚Äúfunny-absurd-number‚Äôs‚Äù one]..or rather he pulls it off without going too far and un-narural...you‚Äôre good mat pat, but sticking to your strengths like in this video makes it already 100% better then otherwise.      

it kept things fresh everynow and then, mixing it up from simple facts/science and physical examples, to then going through the process in a nice pace, then the calculations/formulas and ect.

its possible im overreacting from not having watched much of lately game theory ep, but i think this video feel the right amount of old game theory and new/modern game theory..really gave me that feel again. 


p.s(and not in a ‚Äúfan-service‚Äù/‚Äúcopy paste‚Äù/‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù way,  more in a ‚Äúthis is still the matpat and gametheory i remember, and it has changed/evolved slowly like it always did back then. ‚Äù
Yeah we can take those. To be frank, I, along with the Kirby community were waiting for dark Kirby lore to be tackled by a popular channel, but whatever, I do enjoy science videos. Great shoutout to Meteorz. Also the fact that you did an actual science experiment in the video impressed me.
LOVE THIS NEW STYLE
Maybe he inhales the air and copies the airs ability XD

(I know that in his first game he didn‚Äôt have his copy ability, to anybody who says so R/WOOOSH)
Yay! It's MatPat!
God of destruction kills kirby
but, it didnt explain how he able to gain lift once in the air. just how he falls slowly. EXPLAIN?
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, MAT

Dedede is an EAGLE, not a penguin! He's just... chubby üòù
Yes! Thank you MATPAT for going away from the forbidden side of the kirby franchise! The Kirby community will remember you for this!
We need the 2nd part of the first video! I wanna know about Kirby the god of distraction.
:‚Äô) thank you for poping kirby! That rapist can burn in hell now. I really apreciate you defending us from him
Matpat, I for one am LOVING this new video format! Love actually seeing you almost like an instructor in a Game Theory college course lol keep up the good work! Hope you and Steph are getting your sleep!
Keep doing your regular videos of how you did the Kirby is Evil episode
Awwwww I was totally loving the lore üò≠ but still a great video!
I‚Äôm very confused, why does MatPat not appear to be in his closet???

Someone needs to create a theory about this
Really digging the new format matpat  keep it up
I know this isn't really anything about games but u know the saying "you'll be blown away to Canada" or something can you see if that is really posible
hey mattpatt, since you work in analytics and helped channels wtih youtube would you ever consider assisting me?
I like the new format with MatPat actually on screen
See you couldve easily done that science experiment with the ballons with just images like you always do like the falling objects experiment
Yeah i agree stop showing yourself and taking away the background images. We all like the old format better
Its sad that he buckled under the pressure of kirby nerds who ruined the theory for the rest of us
Dang it I really wanted to see the rest of that video
Do fanaf
Murderer!
Props to you Mat. You had the courage to try something new. Keep up the great work.
I like this change of pace. MatPat should do more of these in-person theory videos more often.
I left a comment on your second vid that I bet nobody will notice
Edit:
I mean game theory if you are looking at your own YouTube channel
wow, GT production has continued to be impressive!
I am getting major Bill Nye vibes from this new video style and it's making me uncomfortable   0_o
Who gave matpat a green screen, I want my 2dpat back
10:48 - Wait... Matpat used to spend actual time solving these formulas for his theories... Why do u stop, Pat?
Doesn't this explain how Kirby falls and not how he flies? Did I miss something?
I really appreciate you going back to the old style for this. Whether this was one time or you'll do more, it felt nice watching the content I subscribed to years ago. You should allowed to do things your way, but never forget your roots. They're the reason you even made it this far
I really like this new format of Theory, with Matpat doing some greenscreen things alongside the usual imagery and jokes, it kinda reminds me of Bill Nye the Science guy... except... you know... GOOD
Thanks you make me smarter each video you are a true inspiration
Man this feels like a blast to the past, if there was more theories like this it would be pretty neat for sure
is it me or is mat looking tan
Watch fnaf world appdate
3 you will see twisted Freddy
Why can‚Äôt you be my science teacher
I like how he's showing up in the video
At Nintendo Sh** were blown 

MatPat: ladies and gentlemen we got;em
(pure boi gasp) it's doing it! (starry eyed face) science is working!
Ah man i really wanted a matpat kirby lore episode.
Will check out Meteorz though!
This isn't flying!
This is falling with style!
I live theories when MatPat pulls out the tools the props. THE CHALKBOARD!!!
Personally don‚Äôt like the new edits, still love you MatPat
weres Austin and why arnt u "Papper Pat" ? /: (
Sometimes change is bad.




But this is good





But if your going to change the style a bit. At least update the intro
Old game theory style back? I think yes
How does Kirby fly?




Helium.
Science is less controversial hahahaha. Hooked me immediately
Well in Kirby games it does say he hovers
Wait, how does Kirby ascend midair? I doubt those little nubs can push him up much.
It says 'smaatest' show in gaming??
Well then how does he go up every time he inhales air?
YOU ARE DOING KIRBY 2 WHETHER YOU OR THE FANBASE LIKES IT OR NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is it just me or is matpat becoming bill nye
I'm better at math than I am science, can you tuder me please?
Still love the content, but I miss the old format... over live action

I feel like some of the info is dumbed down or redundant... 
Yes air has weight... Spent too long on that... And drag... So much vamping...

I guess you need to get the 10 minutes somehow... Plus this science heavy episode feels more like Austin's domain...
Tbh this is one of your best episodes since a long time because you learned from your mistakes! You are a positive role model (atleast to me)!
CONTINUE THE SECOND PART OF THE PREVIOUS KIRBY LORE VIDEO!! I DON‚ÄôT MIND!üòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòà
Hey, I‚Äôm sorry, I love your channel, but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the new green screen thing. I liked the older style better, but that‚Äôs just an opinion, my opinion, thanks for reading. But seriously, you are one of the best creators, and I love your work

P.S. I wrote this before the experiment, and I loved that part, so that is definitely a redeeming factor of this new style, so i don‚Äôt know
i still love this new editing style so much
No offense matpat but you should just stick with the whole animated version it just feels more smooth than these new videos that are a mix between being 100% animated and half live action which just feels weird
What a pity. I'd loved to see the theory video. Your videos are super to relax and think about mindblowing theories, an emotion never found by searching through subreddits.
How does Kirby fly?

Its no science.
He go TOOT TOOT
Moto moto. Can. Fly. After being bested by kirby, of course.
Can you do a video on the pikmin series please
Me and my friend were actually really excited for your opinion, but I guess you just can't please everyone. From reading the comments this was truly the best way to compromise.
Kirby (sob) someone get sakurai
kind of still want to see MatPat do Kirby demon of destruction. Don't care if other people have done it, I like MatPat's style, the narrative he weaves and the odd nuggets of information. DONT LISTEN TO THE WHINERS MATPAT
I do like this vid though.
A wise decision, Mattrick Pattrick.
I like this new style of theories with you in them because it makes you into the Bill Nye of video games
I like this new style but the audio is really hard to hear I have to turn my pc right up to hear though I have lost most of my hearing so that might be not helping.
Nope, late Again
9:06
your explanation for why the full balloon is heavier is either too simplified or incorrect. it's not the air that you put into the balloon, that is making it heavy. it is the additional air you can fit inside due to compression by the elastic shell, resulting in higher pressure and a higher mass/volume aka density. the important factor is the fact, that you can compress air. if you do this experiment with an empty water bottle and a crumpled up water bottle without the air both will exert the same force on the scale. you could test it under water with waterballoons too because water is not as compressible as air. otherwise nice episode, thanks matpat^^
In the beginning, is he mimicking Vsauce or Scott the Woz
My favorite game theories you make are the ones about lore and secrets not science and physics, but I still like all of your theories.

P.S. why are your game theories like Because Science videos? I liked the old way
How can I help you King Dedede?
I need a theory to clobbah dat dere Kirbeh!
That's what we do best at Game Theory!
You better get it with a hint on the ARG!
Kirby is back with his nubblies and amoeba body!
Also, seeing Matpat so excited about the experiment made my day, such pure joy.
B-but I like the new format.
:) 90:6
Uhhh what about the mid air jump boost?? Wtf?
Ok, science is done, now gimme psycho kirby. I actually like those videos about making a villain out of every nintendo characters :P
Mat: I heard you and I switched from the lore of kirby to the science.
Me: puts down torch oh good he dodged a bullet bill.
Congratulations Catpat. Your new format of videos is awesome. <3
Its El Gato



Close enough tho.
I always appreciste someone who loves science experiments
I actually did cut my foot. Left a scar on the top. Still can‚Äôt completely feel it.
I hope you do make part 2 of the Kirby is evil theory!!!! I‚Äôd love to see it regardless of what some people say!!!
HE is FALLING WITH STYLE
Easy he flies because they have different oxygen
This is what bill nye should have been
I miss the old matpat
Do a splatoon 2 Octo etpantaion theory
What if Kirby is inhaling helium ?
Matty!! Plz! Make a part two theory on dreamland's biggest threat! I really want to see another DX
Wait... why would the parachuted speed up that much? Wouldn‚Äôt he just reach his maximum falling velocity before he could reach such a high speed?
its slowly turning into Bill Nye the science guy
when you talk to the turtle that sells crab apples in Undertale, there is a sign that has a picture. If you ask about that picture, the turtle will say "Thats the delta rune" and if you ask what it means he will say "I don't know what it means anymore, but the circle is the angel and the triangles are monsters
I think you missed something, Matpat; Kirby actually manages to ascend in the air  And alter direction. This indicates that he has some form of LIFT as well. I think you're on the right track with the balloon theory... but more so, he's a Hot Air Balloon , not just a slowly falling filled one. I theorize that somehow, Kirby is able to internally heat the air he takes in,  this allowing him to sustain actual flight while he holds it. His arms then serve as a convo of wings/rudders that stabilize his flight. This isn't too far fetched; we've SEEN that Kirby IS capable of swallowing fire, AND releasing energy-based attacks from his mouth. Using the resultant head to keep himself afloat like a real balloon on a radiator then COULD have some relevance.

What do you think?
So in order to find out why Kirby is evil we have to go to Meteorz channel? D:
Here‚Äôs a theory,
What made matpat Show himself in his videos unlike the old ones, I kinda like the old versions.. just saying
My theory is.. idk I have no idea :(
seeing MatPat got excited around 6:07 made me giggle and happy ~
Haven't finished vid but 
Copied the ability of air?
Do a theory on the new vacation simulator
This is new. Usually it's Meme Sciency, but this is quite Science Sciency. :O
I really dig the episode format in this one.
I hope they stick with it.
The dream: a game theory vid on OFF by mortis ghost
It deserves the attention the theory would give it, the 3.0 translation fixed small errors that make HUGE differences in theorizing, and I'm just so damn curious to know what Mat would say about it.

Maybe it would line up with my theories about the game, maybe it wouldn't. Either way I'd watch the hell out of that video.
aw I wanted the second part of the lore üò¢
I liked this video it was very interactive.
Please do a theory on how the universe goes into a loop then into the big bang!!
Just food for thought, MP. When you listen to the vocal minority as opposed to the content majority, you'll end up with nothing. The vocal minority will continue being vocal, while the previously content majority will no longer be content.
The guy from Planet Robobot was trying to kill Dreamland in exchange for the revival of his daughter. Robobot was one of the few games where Kirby actually looked at the situation and said: "Oh crap! Lets get to saving!"
I prefer the old format
GUYS, HE'S WEARING A MIKE!!!!!!!
I like the new style :)
When MatPat uploads, (Film Theory and Game Theorists) it is the highlight of my day and week. Thanks so much Mat.‚ù§
Bruh Matpat you just became the Game/Film version of Bill Nye
New format doesn't really do much for me. Kinda miss the old one
I see Game Theory has evolved! I love this new format!
Hey VSAUCE Game Theorists 0:00
i actually wanted to learn about the kirby lore
I don't think the science of flying has any controversy around it currently
I like the new video format! It feels a lot more interactive and engaging this way.
Keep up the good work, MatPat. :^)
Dedede does fly in the earlier games, in Superstar during the Gourmet Race he does fly in a certain section of race 2 which would canonically happen after his defeat.
I love this new presentation of your videos, it makes me feel more ‚Äúhooked‚Äù or engaged.‚Äù
I like the new editing but I‚Äôm gonna miss cringy mattpatt üòÇ
Tbh... i want the ild version of gane theory where mat pat will just say his lines... brung back the game theory animation style... thx for listening to my TEDtalk
My reason on how Kirby can fly Dreamland air is helium
Bill Nye the science guy!!! (Bill Bill Bill!) UwU
We love you matpat, we really do, but please go back to the old format of cringy jokes and animations with your pic making faces. This video was good but there's something about your original style thats just amazing.
"Isn't it just drag?" said at 7:03
pat i love the new style
He eats helium
wait this isnt austin ?
Hi Matpat!
Your intro animation is still the most awesome on all of Youtube. That being said, some physics you may want to consider reside within this oversided post I made at 1:00am.
(I am a little delusional at the moment. But I am mostly sure my explanation will hold up.)

    With your balloon test: An ideal balloon filled with air and an empty balloon should be of equivalent weight the same on a scale of that type. Presuming the gases in the balloons are the same density as the gases in the room. Because the buoyancy of the object in atmosphere will negate the "weight" of the air inside the filled balloon. That being said, if you were to fill the balloon with your lungs, you would be filling the balloon with a gas(air + co2 mix) which is more dense than the surrounding environment thus contributing to the overall "weight" of the filled balloon which would make it heavier. Your bit about drag/air resistance is 100% spot on, as far as I can tell. 

    As a potential explanation: If Kerby were to expand the volume of his body thus pulling in gases as opposed to pulling in gases to expand his body. The new gases inside his body would be able to heat up from surface contact with the internal face of Kerby's body. And if his mouth isn't 100% closed, the excess pressure caused by the increase in gas temperature would force some of the air out, while allowing the remaining air to decrease in density because of the Ideal Gas Law. This could be giving him buoyancy in atmosphere, and he would just start to float.

Also, in order for my theory to be valid, Kerby would either have to be really light, or exist in a really dense and cold atmosphere.

Sincerely, an armchair scientist.

 P.S. You may also want to consider the density of the gas inside any balloon changes because the gas inside a balloon is under slightly more than atmospheric pressure because the rubber/synthetic balloon is elastic.
Heeeeeyyyyy Matpat it's so cool you gave Meteorz a shoutout in the beginning! He's one of my favorite Youtubers and definitely deserves more recognition like you said.
I'm offended by this. King Dedede is obviously a frog!






(If you don't get it - it's a GTLive joke)
I like this real-life science boy. Gives me old Bill Nye vibes.
I'm surprised you didn't mention how hot air balloons float.   The hot air inside the balloon has less density then the regular air outside of it, causing it to rise like an air bubble in water.  It's long been my theory that inside of Kirby's belly is the ability to heat this air like a furnace to create this effect.  It might also explain why the puff of air upon expulsion looks like steam, and steam is /very/ dangerous due to the amount of thermo energy it contains.
Damn It I was enjoying the kirby god of destruction stuff, I don‚Äôt know kirby lore. Thanks allo- oh wait theres a youtuber all about that? Alright.
MatPat: how does Kirby fly? 

Me: By pure evil! I know of your last Kirby theory!
Kirby can gain people‚Äôs powers by sucking them in so if he sucks in air he will gain its ability to float and maybe also become invisible. Duh
Aw man, I was really looking forward to the part 2...
Loving your new format style, but its so awkward seeing you on screen now xD 
Also, make whatever content or theories you want to! The community should respect your choices and not attack you about it :D
Hey matpat have you seen the new batim video about 1,000 times so you can make a video on it? 
Probably?
Huh ok bye
I like this new format of you, and not the picture, it seems more like we‚Äôre in a science class. ü§ì
He's not flying, he's falling with style! XD
5:25 Density Baby!!!!
i love this new format
Why you stopped using memes and the way you used to ?? + I liked your previous theory
Exist if you agree that MatPat is getting more and more precious every second that passes.
I miss the days when matpat actually did plot theories and not science ones.
One problem with that, how does he provide lift, and CAN he provide enough lift to flap himself upwards
Is anyone else not feeling this green screen effect matpat is using now
You missed fnaf world
I want Pink Guy as Kirby in the Netflix Adaptation now.
Awh I really wanted part two but I guess it‚Äôs for the best üòï
Matpat = grade school science teacher
Do a theory on gothball
Scientist: I study the Science of evolution, what do you do?


Matpat: Uhh...i study the science of fictional video game 
characters
gato is spanish for cat
Just saying I loved meteorz before he was referenced on this channel and I loved LOVED his "what is Kirby cannon" series
Drag racing:
That moment when you take a perfectly heterosexual sport and make it gay.
I'll pay you to be my math teacher and science teacher(jk XD) why aren't you as fun as my science teacher?
What about the mirror world Kirby? And don‚Äôt say he is a reflection of Kirby since Metaknight‚Äôs doppelg√§nger was made by Darkmind and no one else had a copy.
I love that your showing yourself instead of the JPEG. I much prefer to see you.
Yeah,  but Kirby isn't just slowing down his descent, he's physically going up too. How ze fluck is he doing that?!
With the magic of 
Imagination
Not a fan of the new editing style
Will there ever be a Bonbon theory?
i love the new way he films these where he shows his face
prefer only Voicepat
this is just weird to see him whilst he's doing a theory
He floats end of story
Man Kirby is just using Helium simple as that
Fortnite is doing the same
I was hoping for the second half... it's just that if you're mad you're more likely to say something... and I didn't know the things you said, and I'm sure lots of them were lying to seem smart.
yay numbers
Bill Nye the Science guy who?üëÄ
The real question is...How can Dedede fly!?
Edit: oh that was answered in the video....i thought it was his perfection
MatPat is the new J. Jona Jamenson
Goes into kirby lore....

Goes too deep and can't get out....
Nah, this format ain't that good in my opinion.
wait but how is he getting upwards?
you explaind only how he falls down slowely
Hay can you explain generation zero ending please I'm having a hard time understanding it thank you.
Hey! I have a video game I'd like you to make a theory about (i don't really know much about it, I just know it's hella creepy). It's a video game found from the dark web called 'Sad Satan.' Thank you!!
He just continuously fards
Oooh this is different and I like it. More theories like that, pleeeaase?^^ (Not necessarily only science stuff but like, the style of this is great :D)
Kirby flaps his wi-.... i mean arms really fast
Love the vids as always matpat
But this time I don‚Äôt think uv quite done the topic justice
For arguments sake let‚Äôs just assume that Kirby is a balloon
You‚Äôre not wrong in claiming that the balloon will gain mass as it is inflated, and hence gain weight, but as the balloon is inflated it also increases in volume, which contributes to another force called upthrust
Upthrust is the force felt on an object within a fluid, and it is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced, so if the balloon occupies more volume of air (which is a fluid) there is and upthrust felt on the balloon equal to the extra volume that the balloon occupies
Which leads to a problem with a more interesting answer.

As the air in the balloon has the same weight as the air displaced by the balloon, the extra upthrust and the extra weight should cancel, so then why does the inflated balloon appear heavier?
Well, if you have ever played with a balloon you will realise that is has an elastic surface, which means that when released it will shrink to its original shape and size
This surface elasticity will apply a tiny force inwards on the air inside when the balloon is inflated, therefore making the air inside the balloon slightly denser than the air outside the balloon, hence the weight of the air in the balloon is greater than the upthrust from the air that the balloon displaced and so the balloon is heavier
This video sure flew fast
Did you just start with vsause-
The new format feels very... manufactured...
Can you do a can you do a  theory on if Kirby could swallow the whole universe
ew this new format
stop acting like BECAUSE SCIENCE.
Lol sonic in the air
Delegado is Spanish for slim
* Bill Nye theme song plays* MATPAT THE THEORY GUY~
i like the experiment and over all feel of this. Really adds to the video. You should really consider doing more like this!
Am I the only one who pauses the vid just to see the Maths that MatPat does??
What is going on with the audio in this video?
But how much force Kirby‚Äôs nublies have exert in order to overcome the gravity of planet pop star? Waiting for part 2.
When you realise that MatPat is out of his closet and is standing talking to people out in the open....


woh mind blow
You don't just stab Kirby.üò•
Hey can you make how strong is Steve from Minecraft
Whats up with people being constantly angry at Matpat? It's his job to create theories especialy when he goes so deep and puts so much effort into them.
Drag force? You mean air fluid friction? You‚Äôre about to get into some calculus Matt Pat! Trust me Physics is a pain.
Curiosity, the argument why you're using a circle instead of a sphere mostly makes sense. but since he's still three-dimensional wouldn't it be half the surface area of a sphere instead of the area of a circle?
worst green screening ever. still love you matpat xx
12:59 it doesn't effect A, but it erfects Cw in the calcylation
Heres a theory for you mat, remember back when you did that video on mewowths move that makes you rich, well seeing as borderlands 3 is coming out soon, why not take a look at Borderlands 1, Mordecai bird,  Bloodwing has a move called "swipe" and it literally can make him become a billionaire
Why didn't you just explain it with buoyancy? When Kirby inhales air his mass barly changes, but volume increases. That means that buoyant force from air will also increase with pretty constant gravity force, resulting in lower acceleration and slower falling.
Good timing matpat I did a experiment on air today
okay but couldn't he have done the balloon thing by just inflating it and showing how you drop it... and it falls instead of floating?
If I'm not mistaken, the inflated balloon would be more massive, but it should not be pulled towards the earth with more force, because the extra buoyant force in the atmosphere would counteract the weight of the air in the balloon unless the gas in the balloons was denser than the surrounding atmosphere, thus rendering all balloons the same apparent weight regardless of whether or not it is inflated. So how come the demonstration worked for you? You clearly did not perform the experiment in a vacuum, and if you used a gas more dense than air in the experiment, then it is not really fair because the gas that Kirby gulps comes from the surrounding atmosphere. In that case, using common air in the balloons to show a balanced scale in both balloons would still prove your point that gulping air does not make you lighter, but it would be a fair comparison. Feel free to prove me wrong or explain yourself.
-ConfusedTheorist
I miss the edited matpat
I really liked the expirement stuff! That‚Äôs so nice when you kinda prove the point with real life expirements. It‚Äôs very educational and entertaining to watch. I also like the live Matpat change. Keep up the good work!
Gee, I wonder what happened to part 2 of the Kirby being evil theory.
Wow, Game Theory's quality is going way up lately!
one big problem with this theory. 
Weight does not equal density
You still didn‚Äôt address how fast he would have to flap his arms to rise instead of just falling slowly.
I love the new style in your videos, MatPat, keep up the good work
bring back png matpat lol
AWWW man I really wanna see part two with Kirby lower ¬° v ¬° 

To be honest I was really interested on how he will take on this topic
Matpat:*talks about jablinski*
Me: respect 9000+
Ok, who is gonna tell him that Nintendo published an art book that reveals that kirby have a skeleton?
Personally I love this new format. Keep up the good work matpat üëçüèª
10:00, Shouldn't that be a < rather than a >? EDIT: 10:07, same thing. < is less than, > is greater than. Less than 20mph should be <20mph, faster than the speed of sound is >761.2mph.
Huh, I really like this episode. Fun science experiments, mat pat showing is face more, this was a really fun episode
you thought it was kirby BUT IT WAS I, DIO


That'll be the next theory I'm sure.
Austin cries
Well this is different
maybe the whole world has helium around it then kirby swallows it
0:00
Matpat: Heyyyyy
Me, an intellectual: VSAUCES, MICHEAL HERE
Mat Pat Why did you change the type of scenes in your videos?
Gave this a dislike because I actually did want pt.2 and was only starting be interested about the lore from watching pt.1.... Guess at least I know now not to look forward to future videos when you say you'll talk about something in a future video.
Matpat, you know yarn isn‚Äôt 2D, right?
Sure this is a good theory but 







HOW THE CRAP IS WADDLE DEE FLYING IN KIRBYS RETURN TO DREAMLAND
is this gaming class
We now have a new set of new kinds of theory live action let's have a moment of silence for our fallen comrades fatpat and catpat
I miss the animated matpat
video summary: Kirby is like a balloon, and just falls slowly due to air resistance rather than flying. That took 15 minutes to say
WHERE WAS THIS WHEN I WAS IN 4TH GRADE ?????!!!!!! I LITERALLY PUT THE QUESTION THAT HAD USED THIS [YES, with figures and everything else]
Or you could just watch my personal favorite lore vid by The Rpg Monger. One nice vid, w/ all relevant info. Its a good alternative too, meteorz series approach. But they're both valid
He can fight gravity through drag, but how does he actually float upward? Is it literally just his nubbins forcing air downward?
Screw the fan base, not everyone knows the lore, I've never played a Kirby game.
Kirby is able to fly through the sheer force of his anger
5:30
Where‚Äôs Thanos when you need him?
Please please please go back to the old format. Leave the live stuff to GT live. Having Mat on screen is very uncomfortable.
Matt, while I'm glad you listened to the community, please be sure to not get blinded by a negative minority. As a man of science, I imagine you are likely aware of the psychology concept where people tend to focus more on negative experiences than positive ones. Don't let a few upset people control your content, because not every fan has the time to play every single Kirby game, or even knows that the lore of certain games go that deep. 

You're the person who introduced me to the whole Kirby-destruction-god theory, and while I'm glad you plugged the smaller channel, I'm still sad that I never saw your perspective on the rest of it. It worries me that an angry group of fans was able to so easily sway you when you seemed genuinely excited about the topic, which was also new to you as well. I'd call myself a Kirby fan, but I didn't know these sorts of things until you discovered them and shared them with me. Just because a topic has been covered before doesn't mean you can't bring an exciting, interesting, or maybe even simply a more easily-digestible perspective to it. I understand that this is your job by now, and how you make your income, but a group of self-important fans won't always indicate what everyone else is willing to watch.

I've seen you stand strong against communities that seem to think they're entitled to your content before, and I hope that you don't change that mentality now.
Somebody has a green screen. Is it new or am I just unobservant until now?
WE WANT SCREAMING ALCOHOL MAN FOR SCIENCE NOT MATPAT
10:08 what about terminal velocity?
I like game theory better when Matt wasn't there in front of a green screen...
MatPat, considering I haven't played Kirby as religiously as everyone else, I'm extremely disappointed you won't be covering the rest of the lore. I was looking forward to it.
In the span of two weeks Meteorz has increased his subscriber count by almost 50%. Hooray free publicity!
Well.... I really like the new format
This channel turned into Veritasium.
I really like this version of game theory where he is actually in the video
You killed kirby!!!
Keep using the jpeg version of you
What if kirbys lungs produces another gas instead of carbon dioxide
Can you please do a theory on how Ogres and unions are related? We need this
You should do a video on if in portal maybe portal 2 story mode. would the turret king actually be able to fire or is it to big to actually shoot
It's in the ending the turret king
Also this is a good video
SCIENCE IS WORKING -Matpat 2019
When Matpat calls the Super Star Ultra Kirby sprites the Squeak Squad sprites
Mat Pat....
You have my respect back
I am sad I was really looking forward to that lore :(
What if the atmosphere is made of helium, would that change anything?
Remember the doki doki literature club sequel and it said 2018 well it‚Äôs 2019 where is it? So there was a update I think check the files again for more eastereggs
Bill nye the science guy :D
You explained why he falls more slowly sure, but not how he is actually able to fly.  I'm not sure how flapping his arms is going to produce enough draft for him to actually fly.  Not only that but he has to flap his arms both up and down, and when he flaps them up that would actually propel him downward.  I would say this theory is very much incomplete.
Sorry MatPat. Just when you were about to unmask that balooney false hero and expose it for what it is, he sent his followers to charge and assault you in order to silence the truth.
You've become another victim of the Cult of the Pink Destruction, but fortunately you're still with us to tell your story. Unlike those Waddle Dee... may God have pity on their poor souls.
WTF happened to gt?  Like, I love the live matpat and all.  It just feels so weird.  So personal
Ehhh, I really miss Ronnie's editing. (R.I.P.)
He may be able to float, but how does he gain altitude?
I may have missed it and correct me if i'm wrong but this doesn't explain how he gets any upward force, just how he falls slower. How do Kirby go up just by sucking in air?
1:36 That was a good joke.
10:01 that‚Äôs a greater than symbol
Pls make a film theory about confinment pls check it out and take ur time youtube ain't running nowhere.
you should work for nasa
Anyone miss the MatPat with the solid picture and a moving mouth?
I love this new Game Theory format. It just feels more energetic (and for want of a better word, sincere) than the old. I'm genuinely getting back into Game Theory and I love it.
Matpat you are beautiful and all but I think it looks more professional the old way you did the videos
Kirby may be  the god of destruction





But pichu is the god of death.
I like the old format more, but the new one is pretty LIT.
Del gato actually translates to, "Of the cat."
Can we stop with the real life matpat invading everywhere? I live ya my guy but nothing beats the photoshopped matpat head
I like thks new format :)
I have a simple theory.
Kirby is inhaling helium.
Mat I surprised that your not like a professor of a college or something considering how much you know and stuff.
Who wants to see matpat take a test from 1st grade ALL the way to 12th grade like mr beast did bc matpat is VERRYYYYYYY good at math
üëáüèº
If you wanted Episode 2, please read for a moment. And if you already know this stuff, please correct me if I'm wrong. Can't go feeding lies.

Okay, so Kirby Lore. Kirby is the reincarnated good side, with Zer0 being the bad side, of a God of destruction known as Void Termina, who existed in the days of old before being defeated and sealed by four heroes of love or something like that‚Äî it's believed that that was when he was reincarnated "as a friend," which is stated in the boss card for the fourth phase of the battle. If you've played Star Allies before, you'll find that Void Termina has many things that hearken back to important Kirby stuff, such as Kirby's face, voice, and  "music theme"(Green Greens but, well, better) as well as a second form that is quite literally Zer0. He has the Master Crown on his head and in his attacks, which was made by the ancients and modeled after his crown. He also has all manner of Kirby paraphernalia on his body, like the Star Rod for instance. Void Termina is the beginning of several things in main series Kirby games, and Kirby just happens to be one of them‚Äî born of a god of destruction, but using his unlimited power as a force of good.

There's more on this if you check out MeteorZ as MatPat suggested, but you should also check out WoolieVersus, because he has a playlist of some 5 Kirby lore dumps, all very worthwhile if you've closely followed the series.

Also, please tell me you noticed the Vsauce reference at the beginning.
Not really a fan of all the screen time. I mean you‚Äôre cool but it ruins the videos.
This was surprisingly low quality. You do realize that when you breathe into a balloon you are filling it with an atmospheric mixture that contains more heavier gases such as co2, yeah? So of course it'd be heavier. You also didn't mention Kirby's expansion as Kirby breathes in possibly resulting in similar or lesser density.
damn... the format now is bit awkard... and the theory kinda lackluster.... "how is kirby able to fly" drag force... meeeeh... where is the "trying to explain the upwards momentum"? or the continious elevation just by flapping his arms?...  not to be a downer but the effort of this video and a few videos lately seem to fall on the editing part of the video.. not the content part of the video, i for one much rather better content with crappy presentation, than a live matpat with science demonstations and editing revolving around him, but a subpar content (by his own standar)... calling it a "theory" is bit far for this one.... but hey i been wacthing for years, i guess having a few rough months is ok, otherwise keep up the good work.
Mat pat if a tomato is a fruit than is a ketchup a smoothie
This is a bit stretching it but is it possible that Kirby selectively inhales helium particles from the air around him? That way, even if he's heavier with air inside him, his overall density is still less than the air around him? Which enables him to float?
Is it the same for skydivers?
Please this is simple the air he inhales turns into helium in some organic way oh so this got me thinking why can't Meta Knight inhale or do the same stuff Kirby can?
Matpat: how to stretch a 30 second conclusion into a 14 minute video 
-Volume 68
I‚Äôm really enjoying this new style for Game Theory. (Also thanks for giving meteorz a shoutout. He really deserves it.)
Planet Pop star is made of helium XD
Quick question how does Sonic's homing attack works he jumps in the air turn into a ball and locks on a Target and propels at it with enough Force to destroy robots explain logic please
0:12 a lot of things wrong here.
1. Kirby didn't kill Haltmann. After the fight he's shown to be fine. His fate was his own doing.
2. Susie was Haltmann's accountant. They'd been in contact. They speak to each other before the fight starts. Come on.
3. They weren't on the cusp of a reunion. Susie was planning to steal Haltmann's company from him and Haltmann didn't recognize Susie so they weren't about to have a reunion moment. 

This is more egregious than using the wrong cover art come on MatPat.
I like this theory a bit but you never actually explained how kirby flies. You have explained that he falls slowly but i dont think flapping those little nubs of his is enough to counteract the force of gravity.
This video felt like an online physics lecture
This is what I'm learning in my algebra class lol
at the beginning, i thought he was gonna say "Heyyy Vsauce, Michael here"
I like this new style of 
GT
Gotta love that intro
Pop star may also have much lower gravity than earth's
I was ready for part 2 üò≠
Fun fact: I actually did a project on Galileo and on a book it metioned the same experiment
Ok so after a few episodes of this new style I have come to the conclusion that... I don't think I like it.
So, 'nubblies', is the proper termonolgy for his arms? Can we apply that to an inch-worm's legs? So stubby and squishy~
1:30 Matpat..... RUN!
Mask of mayhem
oh come on,i wanted to see the second part of the theory.
i am not familiar with the series,i wanted to hear your voice and see your video editing where you explain these things to me.
experience ruined.
I was really looking forward to part 2. As someone who only played 1 Kirby game in his entire life, I was very interested in seeing some of the lore and theories. Please consider making part 2!
Maybe he uses its tummy or belly to bounce?

Edit:Maybe butt bouncing
I am unnerved by this new format. Not horribly so, but enough for it to be distracting.
OMG I THINK NIGHTMARE FROM FNAF 4 IS MICHAEL AFTON
Tell me about the lore.
His excitment when science is working lol i lile being able to see matpat it makes me feel more connected

i laughed when he popped Kirby XD (there is something wrong with me)
Gato is cat in Spanish
mat blows balloon
me: gasp
mat blows balloon again
me: GAWD ITS GONNA SPLOOP

me: :|
10:00 he says less than but the words on the screen say more than
Anyone noticing changes in Matpat‚Äôs videos? He ditched the picture with his hand on his chin and instead is now putting in his whole body with motion.
Dood you should make a nother doctor who video there are millions of theories do make
What? I loved the god of destruction Kirby theory
10:08
He used the wrong sign(I'm 99.9% sure) he should've used > instead of <

Tell me if I'm wrong
Just curious how does he increase altitude while falling?
Very into this new style of videos!
awww i wanted to see that lore kirby episode
Can you please do your videos like this please.
I'm liking this new format.
It feels more like a class.
Aww I wanted to see the second part of that theory :P
Everyone seems to love the new format but idk I‚Äôm just not really feeling it, but if you continue with it then I‚Äôll get used to it
Matpat: Game theory on destruction god kirby!
Everyone: Yas!!!
Matpat: Nevermind think I'll just explain air.
I apologize I forgot it WAS JUST A THEORY A GAME THEORY üòÖ
The new format gives me classic Bill Nye the Science Guy vibes!  Love it!
You didn‚Äôt even answer the question. In the title, you asked how Kirby flies. In this video, you answered how he is able to fly. Two completely different things.
Ignore the haters everywhere. I love the moving film, i love seeing you actually talk and rant, and I'd love to see the kirby=demon theory in full as well!
hahaha xD actually, gato is cat. Delgado means thin. You were close :>
Bu....but... I was excited for a part 2...
Meteorz  is better than you
So wait for the last vid doesn't that make metta knight a Kirby carnation that doesn't be come evil like
Can you add captions to your videos? I really love them but I feel like over time you‚Äôve began talking faster and it‚Äôs getting harder to understand what‚Äôs being said
14:15 I kinda stared crying
I wish you'd still release the pt 2. I was super excited for it. Disappointing.
But how does Kirby ascend?
What has Game Theory become???
PLS PLS PLS MAKE PART 2
I did have this idea that(based on the marble universe theory which I only heard about a week ago) that Kirby is actually a sentient universe and Void Termina is more like a mass of fundamental particles, think the singularity before the Big Bang.
You shouldn't have changed the theory.
I remember the fun labs I used to do in the 6th Grade too.
He produces helium from his insides and jumps
The dragon in return to dream land is a girl sorry I had to point that out
Matpat could you please do a theory about dere evil exe? I love the game!
science of Kirby? HA!






1+1= Planet Dreamstar
2+2= Fish
Nintendo + Pink = Kirby
Him flap he's arms

Next question
Love the live action explanations ‚ù§Ô∏è
Evil Kirby part 2 next please!
You didn't add right on one of your fnaf vids, fnaf3 would actually take place in 2017
I love this style, you should do it more,  but I can't speak for everyone.  If you agree like or comment
I think it's so cool that the game theorists are getting creative and evolving their videos with cool featues like green screens. Instead of staying content about doing what they've always done, they're on fire to be creative and bring more to the table. This is why I love watching Game Theory ^.^
Interesting format, but best theory in a long time.
That explains why he falls slowly, but not why he actually gets higher.
Del gato 
Means that cat
As far as the new format vs the old one? Honestly? Do a bit of both. This video felt more fun and personable and it was interesting to change things up, but the old format is great too and feels more focused. Use em both!
Matpat can you make a theory about ancestors the human oddity?!?
Sigh, he didn't add the link to the other youtuber.
But i wan't it
He farts to go up
This is so cool the active experiments and matpats loveable face
Would Austin be mad?
No offense but medical cbd being passed is a good thing..  despite it being controversial
A better question to answer would be how Kirby is able to produce enough lift to fly from his tiny cone-shaped arms
yea, but how much power and force is Kirby exerting in each push/flap. Also, what about the Wing or Jet ability?
I dunno why, but this new format reminds me of Phillip DeFranco.
HEEELLO Beautiful Bastards, Welcome to GAME THEORY! Let's jump into it~
Thanks, science teacher!

Have you seriously considered making more sciency videos for educational channels?
you should do a theory on just shapes and beats ^.^ i love your vids
You know what, I don't blame you for switching gears. You would have just been regurgitating decade-old fan theories that are still going strong in the fandom today. Still, would've liked some non-Kirby fans to be introduced to that side of Kirby through you. Hopefully Part 1 is incentive enough for people to go looking!

That said, I love me a science theory! It's why I joined and why I stay. Keep up the good work!

Kirby is a god of destruction with infinite power, but he is simultaneously an innocent kid. Innocence isn't always good, and it's probably responsible for 90% of his impulsivity.
Erm... Matpat... I think you switched around your greater than and less than signs... When talking about the skydive, you said "less than 20 mph" while the screen said >20 mph, and vice versa with the next statement
Lol thanks for spoiling Planet Robobot outright xP
You also forgot to mention that when a dark matter being reincarnates it will be either good or bad based on what kind of energy was used to kill it which is why in the old fights Kirby shoots hearts and stars
üé∂Faster than the speed of sound  üé∂
I was looking forwards to part 2
I love game theory ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mister. Theorist do keep im minde that kirby is only a baby according to the TV show.
Okay, yeah, that explains his falls, but how does he go further up while already puffed up?
I like the ones about science slightly more than the lore ones
What is Rayman
Is this going to become the Doctor Who trilogy part two??? Sorry, it had to be said.
I miss the old cut out matpat.
science in action ladies and gentlemen
Matpat, you're adorable and I love you
Matpat I love your theories and have been watching for as long as I can remember and your so great but in not gunna lie this new style of video makes this channel feel like you average theory channel that YouTube is full of.
But you not an average theory channel, your the game theorists and even if you don‚Äôt change it back please consider making some tweaks.
Matpat
Aka: the Bill Nye of video games
Can you do a Theory on the strongest Kirby ability
Seeing this new format you're using to edit makes it feel like a face reveal, even tho I already know what you look like.
Point is, seeing you come to life in this theory analysis is new, sure, but it's giving off an aura of finally getting to know you as a youtuber and how you express yourself. It's nice!

Also,  üòà
This with the green screen was really good
Better than other videos. Best way to do it üëèüëè
I really like new format! It's more dynamic.
I love you and everything, Matthew, but this new format is uncomfortable for me and I much rather prefer less live action incorporated into your videos as it makes me feel like I‚Äôm being lectured to as opposed to watching something for entertainment

At 10 minutes, he says "... less than 20 mph." But it says "> 20 miles per hour", which is greater than
make that god of destruction video... I dont care about Meteorz.
This video is real vsauce3 vibe
Doubling the surface area may make Kirby descend slower, but I was expecting MatPat to show that the increase in size does not account for hew slowly Kirby is shown to descend. And in order to fly upward Kirby would need to be pushing a lot of air downward by some mechanism. We need some more F=ma and some canon Kirby weights and measures to make this a full theory.
hey matpat go back to your old format and get rid of this
No Franchise has less plotholes than Kirby
I like lore theories more than science theories
How smart is donkey kong
I love kirby episodes but have you ever thought of doing atheory on another character from his games?
Every time he says a freaking intricate word that constructs a well-elaborated sentence. I have to search it up in the internet!! Why are you so versed , up-to-date and broadly knowledgeable?!




And what's more sad about this, is that I searched the words up just to make this comment stand-out and sophisticated .  .  .  .  .
YouTube is drunk 6 views 24 likes lol
Matpat: ‚Äò...maybe the science will be less controversial‚Äô
Me: visibly excited because science=austin
Matpat: just keeps going
Me: conflicted disappointment
Hey matpat i found a Secret in undertale if you name the fallen human soup (its from steven cartoon network)I was surprised
Mat I know it's your job, but ITS A KIDS GAME, DON'T GET YOUR MIND WRAPPED UP. just kidding. good job on the video
You should definitely do more science experiments! :-)
Typo at 9:59, he said less than 20mph when it showed the more than sign (>)
I love the new format
Can you please do a theory on the good place
I still wanted to hear more of the Kirby lore...
I loved the balloon demonstration!! üéà ‚ù§Ô∏è
I like this new format
What about the warp star and how he summons it
I don't like the green screen backdrop, no offense I enjoy the voice-overs more often
gato means cat, delgado means thin
Or how he gets the hat
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
A science theory, these are my favourite and I hope you continue to do more! I love watching for the entertainment and learning some science along the way
"I still think that he's a threat!"

MatPat v Kirby: Dawn of Theories!
while i disagreed with your conclusions I am still interested in your kirby lore theories. please make the part 2!
I like this new type of format for game theory. IMO makes it feel more like a ‚Äúshow‚Äù
9:58 thats a greater than symbol...
10:08 and that's a less than symbol. Someone needs a refresher on inequalities.
Kirby is a gift
BEST OUTRO EVER!!!!!!!
Can you compare the size of the USA to the Great Sea and its islands in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker?
Edit: Could you also compare the ocean to the Great Sea and the islands too?(maybe a separate video)
I like what you're doing rn, its new and it just makes me feel a bit closer to you than just seeing your edited face on stuff. Keep going you guys are doing great <3
I love the Bill Nye vibe MatPat, keep it up.
14:30 is Mat Pat now stronger then goku?
I'm actually kinda disappointed to not see the part 2 vid
other theory, he litterly has an portal in his stomach to the "kirby dimension" an empty space where everything kirby eats ends up, why not have it be a vacum and he hast to "eat" to open the portal and have the nothingnes make him lighter than air
Hex said you're not an intellectual :(
West of loathing part 3 üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Can you talk about Bomberman Lore?
Neat new format
This feels like a Vsauce episode...
MATPAT THE SCIENCE GUY
I wish I had gone into the comments on the first video to shut people down with their hating. This was interesting but there are way more people that don't know the lore of kirby and were really interested in hearing the second part of the lore video. I really hope you reconsider and make that video for the rest of us who were excited for it. Love you always though and appreciate the consideration.
There is a lot of false info. But I ain't butthurt, so I'll let it go. But  it still bugs me, so ill say at LEAST one nitpick.


In the beginning of the video, you said that kirby couldnt fly in Kirby's Dream Land (3:50). Not only is he flying on the cover, but you contradict yourself later in the video here (). I personally have played the original game, and you could still fly. If your still not convinced, here's an emulator for you:       
Poke the side of the balloon next time Brat Pat. You punctured the top having the air pushing down  the balloon. You know already though.
This episode was great. Good job going back to basics
Bring back the photoshopped matpat on a podium
I like this new style. We even got to see an experiment, his usual photoshop thing and the real MatPat! I hope you keep this style of video!
Awww. I liked the old theory. 

Oh well, that was good too.
I just imagine Austin being like ‚ÄúHi, its me Austin!‚Äù 
And the game companies just sighing and saying ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù
The real question is: Does Austin actually send these emails?
Nobody:
Austin: "Ever wonder what size the crater would be from mario jumping off of yoshi?"
Y'all probably think Mario is pretty strong to exert that much force on Yoshi's back. 




Well, can Mario swallow a Bullet Bill whole, digest it and turn it into an egg within a second? 
He protecc
He atacc
But he break Yoshi's Bacc
Luigi‚Äôs flutter jump next! anyone? No? Okay.
Bowser: I‚Äôll kidnap yoshi 
Mario: ok
Bowser finds a pile of flesh and blood
Mario: I needed the coin to get extra levels
You should take a look at a similar topic in Luigi's/Yoshi's flutter kick to maintain/gain vertical height in the middle of a jump.
1:50
Anyone else notice Yuri back there
Austin, what have you done with yourself
"I fear no man!"
...
"But that thing..."
Austin:*exist*
Nintendo:"it scares me!"
PETA: Ladies and Gentleman we got him!
I‚Äôm going over similar concepts in my physics class and I really appreciate the math done in this video. It helped connect some dots so thank you and I‚Äôll be sure to show my professor tomorrow. 

Great work!
Wait, Austin. If you know how much Mario is moved by the springboard, and you know how much Mario + Yoshi is moved by the springboard, it's still possible to calculate Yoshi's mass.
He protecc
He atacc
But  most importantly
You jump off his bacc
0:37 Wait, do you think turtles are amphibians? Or is that about Yoshi, a dinosaur and thus an avian.
1:53 Wait wait did anyone else see yuri in the corner or am I tripping
Me: Plays Mario And dosen‚Äôt jump
Mario: I DIED
Next up, is another new game theory by Austin to Mistwalker, or even Bandai Namco, or whoever created Spyro the Dragon.
Where is the calculating games character wealth part 2 video
hey austin.... you forgot that mario's being messed up by this jump as well.
newton's third law remember?
Spring and Inverno, thanks for the Vivaldi flashbacks
No one: 
Austin: (insert video game thing here) IS DEADLY HERE‚ÄôS WHY!
1:51 um, Austin,  I think Yuri is behind you...
Roses are red 
Mario is Fun
Sorry yoshi I can‚Äôt make this jump... 






we‚Äôve had a good run
12:06 mario maker 2 is adding a seesaw which will give you another way to compare weights, but only if the seesaw doesn't have the lack of collision the spring had in SMW.
1:53 I just wachted the fnaf vid and i used full brightness and I saw yuri next to Austin.
1:51 you can see yuri from doki doki on the right.
Just how strong is YOSHI to survive falls like those, just to be put through it again?
It makes sense that gravity is 240.23 meters per second squared because mario crushes people when he jumps on them
14:58 I'd think Tartar from Splatoon 2 is still the most evil thing ever made by nintendo
00:36 I'm sorry I tried to not get peeved.... But turtle is a reptile




Haven't you seen Over the Hedge?
Oh hay look it is... YURI!!!???
Me: Oh hey im learning about this in school! 
clicks off video
Damn it Austin I want to find out who the richest character in gaming is
It's an interesting indication of Game Theory and its content that when I saw the force value of  2917 newtons I could immediately recognize it as in the "bone breaking range" of force, similar to that required to crack a skull. GameTheory Everyone! It teaches you how to BREAK BONES.
1:53 
Why is Yuri from DDLC there?????
Austin?! AUSTIN I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU!
6:16 did you just cancel out mass and the square root of mass?! No... you've forgotten to put the square root on both masses... ufa... i feel better now...
12:19 whaaaaat?! that's not the force of the spring, but the force of the spring+legs... yoshi's legs are stronger, they jump higher. actually waaaay higher because the mario+yoshi jump higher than mario alone.
funny video, nonetheless. congrats. keep it up.
but if yoshi and mario survive on a super massive planet, it would feel like a full grown adult faling on your back relatively speaking. which cause some damage.
Yoshi is in town why





BECAUSE WERE THROWING HIM IN A HOLE!
1:46
Something's getting close to Austin... is that Yuri?
When he says his name in the intro, I had flashbacks to when I was in 6th grade...







Puberty is a demon...
If you measure fall speed in SMW you need to specify if you held the A button or not - Mario has two falling speeds there.
4:00 Hokay, here's the Earth.
OH S*** WADDUP!
Through this episode I kept thinking: ‚Äúbuff muscle mario‚Äù
"Mario is most evil character Nintendo ever made..."
Sorry Austin, number one always will be Kirby.
11:40 Yoshi is only sometimes in the same weight class as Mario. For example, they're in the same class in Mario Kart Wii, but in other games, like Mario Kart DS, Yoshi is a lightweight character, while Mario is a medium-weight character. The stats in Mario Kart 8 show Yoshi to be four units of weight, while Mario is six units, meaning that Mario is heaver than Yoshi by two units.

mario rpg super jump explained.
Me: totally lost
Austin: Now that you know the basics...
Me: ...Wait what ._.
I don't know why, but Austin looks like the 9th-grade history teacher at my school, Mr. Garret
Me: (sees a Yoshi sacrifice jump)
Also me: (Walks in other direction)
Austin: ‚ÄúHI, IT‚ÄôS ME, AUSTIN!‚Äù
Me: ::instinctively turns down volume::
I'm pretty sure the song near 12:00 is from the 'Four Seasons,' by Vivaldi. More specifically. I'm pretty sure it is from 'Spring.' Can anyone verify?
Question, what if... Mario isn't jumping, but Yoshi is bucking him off his back?
Hey, MatPat could you plz do a GT about the Mega Man storyline?
With EXE, Star force, Zero, Battle network, and whatever else.
Your videos are brilliant!
This is beautiful art in so many ways, thank you!
Please make a theory about an anime called Mob Psycho! And who is "???"
Was hoping Austin was doing this episode you have no idea how happy I was to hear "IT'S ME AUSTIN!"
Roses are red
Memes are neat
I can't make this jump
Lmao YEET
Serously! 
Where is matpat?!
You know he's a dinosaur right?

A really light but tough dinosaur that isn't even phased by spikes
I love these episodes lol Always fun to see how deadly regular videogame moves are xd

Also I wonder why they never change m/s into km/h... eh
"now that u know the basics"
BASICS????
I can't hold it anymore
Me: watches till 1:47   and freezes
Me: holy magic carps is that Yuri?
Quickly scribbles down notes for math final

Me:...

Austin: HI, IT'S ME, AUSTIN

Me: Yus üòé
I liked the music choice :)
1:53 there‚Äôs Yuri on the right of the screen
So basically how to spike yoshi in smash:
1. Get on his back
2. Go of the ledge
3. Jump of his back
roses are red
this won't rhyme






Matpat is Mario
Austin is Yoshi
and I told you it wouldn't rhyme
Roses are red

"Hokay, so here is the Earth"

I see your 2003 reference
Bowser is just trying to save Peach from the evil plumber.
You're forgetting that yellow yoshis (or green with a yellow koopa shell in his mouth) will pound the ground (with visible puffs of smoke) when he hits, causing the ground to shake and enemies to flip upside down.
With those visual cues and reworking the formula, I'd expect a yellow yoshi sacrifice move to put a crater in the mushroom kingdom.

Can't make the jump

Austin: Mario is the most evil character Nintendo has ever made
Kirby   : >:)
Austin, these have become my favorite episodes of game theory, the ones where we do a bunch of ridiculous math just for fun, whereas Mat has been doing more lore based videos. While those are still entertaining and usually worth the watch, it's the math vids that really initially drew me in to the channel years ago. Thanks for the fun math and science and I look forward to your future videos! releases
*Smash Home run Bat SFX* GAME!! 

The winner is... MARIO!!
Wouldn't a basketball player making a jump shot be a more accurate example? Or a motocross rider ditching his bike midair
More evidence that Mario is quite the super human.


Also, not going to cover how sturdy Yoshi has to be to not only survive this but be fine?
Let's all say it together:



That is

GOD!
1:52 anyone see Yuri?
Congrats Austin. This video was good. I appreciate not being yelled at for a whole video. I'll be watching more often now
I'm in Newtonian Physics right now and it's nice to see all the productive ways we can use it ‚ò∫
I glade other people also taught the math mistake at 6:14 . hope in humanity restored!
Hey Austin I‚Äôm a physics major in college and o just wanted to let you know that every time you do one of these videos you inspire me to work even harder. You remind me of my passion for physics and science. I just wanted o say thank you.
Austin: talks about math
Me: soo your telling me Mario Is 1,55 in height and weights 89 kilograms...
6:47 gosh darn it Austin why didn't u just say FMA XD people know that and also mat says that formula like this every time he uses it so people would know ig lol
Question.
Can we really consider that air resistance is negligible when we are reasonning only with terminal velocity? Wouldn't that make it more plausible?
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly
He break your bacc
"All the way back in 1990, nearly 30 years."
Nah man I'm pretty sure the 90's were still ten years ago.
Wait, at 6:18 did he just use the square root of mass to cancel the mass on the other side of the equation? That's not how that works, Austin
4:37 Mario is a nintendus hominidus, so that explains why does he jumps more high than a human. Theory unaccurate, the end.
14:12 Mario, I don't feel so good
than why can yoshi survive multiple of these jumps
Bowser only protects Peach from Mario. I understand it all now! Bowser knows what Mario is capable of.
Hate to break it to Austin but I think GT's gonna get more watch time with matpat narratingüò¨

He's become the icon of GT and FT
Yooo, At 1:53 in the right corner their is a hidden yuriüòÅ
Mario can break bricks with his hands
Mario can jump proper high while on yoshi while jumping




Conclusion= Mario is a GOD
Man, Mario doesn't skip leg day.
"hI iT'''S me AuStiN!" Freaked me out a little.
Dear Austin, 
I love you, so much. Don't ever change. Unless it's to keep getting better... Ok, let me rephrase. Don't ever go away. I need this kind of science in my life.
Sincerely, me
LOL!! that intro is insane XD

6:17 Not to be picky, but the masses don't cancel out because you have m on one side and sqrt(m) on the other. :/
the math in this one is a bit klanky, too many assumption, but i don't know how else you could do it though


the spring thing, doesn't really work because it is a closed system, the kinetic energy is equal to the max gravitational potential energy of yoshi and mario, so we can't really get that info from the spring, but dat a nice spring 100% energy efficiency from potential to kinetic
Love the "End of ze World" reference there at 4:40 ish, "Hokay, so here is the world..."

a gentleman you are
roses are red 
So is Austin‚Äôs face 
Watch out kids Austin has a mace
How about a video on why Mario can jump on deadly things if he's spinning? Or why yoshi can? Would be an awesome video. Keep up the good work.
You should do a physics episode over lanky Mario now!
Roses are red,
Princess Peach is a woman.

But thats just a theory
A GAME THEORY
Hey Austin, if you wanna have more SCIENCE fun with Nintendo, how about this premise:

"How the hell does Samus' Gravity Suit function work? Is it possible to replicate that tech or does it make no goddamn sense?"
Yoshi didn‚Äôt complete his Duolingo lesson today. It‚Äôs over for him
Dear Austin,

THE SCIENCE segments are my favorites! Everything from the music, the rants and even the science itself! Keep it up Austin!

3:39 "Hokay, so here's the Earth"


Chillin. Damn that is a sweet Earth you might say-ROUND!...
Hey Austin I don't care what game you use but you should debunk air geysers in video games being able to propel the player up (like fortnite's geysers because those are pretty extreme and I know you love talking about fortnite)
"Hokay, so. Here is the earth." I almost spit my drink out hahahahaha
WOW! ANOTHER MARIO THEORY! ISNT THIS ORIGINAL?

Scrolls down Game Theory's channel and ONLY sees Mario theories

YUP!... Just SOOOOOOOOO original!!

Yup, this is definitely an Austin video
amazing . the legends r tru, math IS related to science

Hey Austin! Could you do an episode on "The Traveler" from the Destiny franchise?
1:47
Best Doki on the right, hidden in darkness.
i'm revising physics, thank you for letting my parents judge me less on gaming/watching barely related videos to my studying... stu(dying)  more of   :)
When you said that the gravity in the mushroom kingdom's gravity was 4x the amount of earth's I stopped watching
Rip to all those Yoshis who have been thrown into the void...
Press F for respect
MARIO! DON'T JUMP!
Grabs camera
Ok! Now jump!
when you calculated initial velocity you canceled mass with the square root of mass, i might not be explaining it right, but its like saying x^2 = x which is only true for the values of 0 and 1
Austin:blah blah blah math stuff

Me:o-------o ........what?
this channel is why I'm doing good at physics class....




also knew it that Mario is an a-hole O*O
Yoshi must have immortality since he doesnt die in yoshis island he can survive being smashed to the ground and he doesnt even limp when mario hops back onto him.
Jacksepticeye: "Okay, now jump!"
Hey Austin, I have an idea.


How much strength is needed for Steve to swim up a waterfall in Minecraft?
THE MATG IS TOO CARAZY SIR! MY HEAD IS HURTING! But idc
here's a thing to make a video about how do the characters in dragon ball/z/super "deflect "the Ki blasts off their hands? hm? hm??lol
Austin: HI
Nintendo: oh no
Austin: HI!! I'M AUSTIN
Nintendo: AHHHHH WHERE'S THE SECERT BUNKER WE GOTTA HIDE... HES GONNA MAKE OUR FAMOUS CHARACTER A MURDERER

Edit: Omg thank you all so much for 400 likes! The most amount of likes I've ever had before was like 4... So this is kinda crazy for me. Also some people have said that MatPat and Austin aren't making Mario a murderer and that it's Nintendo that made him a murderer and I agree.
I wonder how many likes I can get...
You could have done this a lot easier by using conservation of energy and momentum adjusted to an accelerated reference frame
It all makes sense if the mushroom kingdom is hyrule kingdoms dream world because of links awakening
Yoshi has muscles for surviving being stomped on by Mario, every time Mario lands on his back after jumping he survives. You actively jump on his back to ride him.

Regular goombas are not so lucky to have shells like koopas or be defensively round like Galoombas. Heck dry bones don't powder because of magic and Koopa shells are basically made of Mettaur/Metool helmets.
the physics minor inside of me screamed throughout this video at the units (e.g. 7:09)
Ahhh, perfect I was just contemplating the communication of the concept of closed system physics to children, how fitting
One quick mostly insignificant problem to this video:
quite a bit you wrote acceleration as ms^2 and velocity as ms.
This, in fact, should actually be m/s^2 and m/s respectively.
I noticed sometimes you used the correct units, but most of the time you used the wrong ones.
Just wanted to give you a heads up for any future videos you make.
That opening was great. I love old timey stuff!
Yoshi clearly doesnt accelerate that fast though. Using the springs to find mass is innacurate because   springs launch things according to how much they are compressed. Not how much force is applied. I think that yoshi is just unbelievably thicc and you should find his mass based on the acceleration that the game shows.
Austin you made mistake in your units. I watched the whole video and realised that when you were calculating lightspeeds for the mushroom, you said years not seconds
He can jump that high, but can he land safely from that height? Never skip leg day.
You should do some Kirby math
Austin at the end tho üòÇüòÇ
He does science, math, physics, AND he dances!! What a cool dude!
I'm older than my favorite game?! Ouch.
Loved this video

Ps you should do the science of the gels from portal 2 ( I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a whale of a time :) )
This reminds me of the video talking about double-jumping where it explains that in order to pull off a double-jump, you'd have to exert enough force to split the atoms in the air and cause a nuclear explosion xDD
[3/4 into the video]

‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve got the basics-‚Äú
That is a sweet Earth you might say?.. WROWNG! 

Cool joke call back Austin!
That beginning when it starts playing habanera I knew you was about to go inüòÇ
0:07
Yoshi: Am I A Joke To You?
Mario: Yes, Yes You Are
I appreciate the background music, especially during the first segment.
1:51 what is that thing in the dark on the right pause


ITS YURI
My question is what‚Äôs the name of the song in the background (in the beginning when he‚Äôs starting the ‚ÄúDear {game company})
Thanks for telling me
Sincerely, Mario
It feels weird being early in a game theorist video
1:45 - 1:54. 



Guess someone wants to take a stab at science?
6:16
Austin, great job at introducing some phycics to the kids but here you slipped up. m and square root of m which cancel each other out...
You will probably not read it but if you do, don't feel about it, it happens to the best of us.
do a kerbal space program theory, like can they actually survive a 50 m/s fall
WHERE'S THE SECOND PART OF RICHEST CHARACTER IN GAMING??? HUH???
watches to the end
Well, it's all adding up as why Peach hooked up with Luigi.
So‚Ä¶ THIS is where crude oil came from.
‚ÄúOh em gee‚Äù
-Austin, 2019
"ms" is not "meters per second". For that you should write "m/s".
As for acceleration, meters per squared second, you can write it "m/s/s", "m / (s^2)", "m s^-2", etc, but not "ms^2".
Austin, keep it up! You are so adorable!
1:51 why is Yuri in the background 

Is your next theory going to be about doki doki literature club??
Or Yuri??
The equation used are from physic, not math, even tho it can ne consider as mathematiques
Dear Austin, 

I'm calling you out!!! Stop with the side tracking and get on with the Richest Video Game Character!!!!!!!!!

Sincerely,
Natanis Likens
Hhmmm...... U forgot about yoshi's SHELL bruv...
If the Game Theorists have taught us anything, Mario is a monster!
To set the final results into relation to car speeds for metric people (m/s is not that previlant in everyday use, but km/h is):

12:55
42.6 m/s = 153.36 km/h


51.2 m/s = 184.32 km/h


91.89 m/s = 330.804 km/h
14:55 ‚ÄúMario, consistently, is the most evil character Nintendo has ever made.‚Äù

Watch MatPat‚Äôs video on Kirby
Before Mario jumps off yoshi, the mass you would use would be Mario + yoshi. After he jumps then it‚Äôd just be Mario
Would it be possible for yoshi to exert an upward force as Mario jumps from his back, explaining Mario's extra height?
Repeat after me

Turtles are reptiles not amphibians
Now, all of you rocket scientists out there can tell me how im wrong, but wouldn't the calculations used for this be and have a similar result to Austin's Genji video on double jumping
Nah man Mario just has the STRONK
hi Austin, I missed you, my old friend.
Plot twist Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach all the time to save her from Mario! But hey that's just a theory A video game theory!
6:17 that moment when he divided te m out a a root... it hurts to my eyes
Mario‚Äôs yoshi sacrifice jumping is basically spiking yoshi into the blast zone with the big funny forward aerial.





Memes are funny.
Maybe Yoshi's saddle is a focused sonic weapon and mario is wearing sound dampening underwear?

Or maybe its spring loaded?
Still waiting for the multi series theory...
‚ÄúMario is the most dangerous character‚Äù




He forgot about Kirby.
Oh sweetie what have you gotten yourself into now you're going to have to do a study on how dense Yoshi's bones are so that he can survive a fall like that I wish you the best of luck
6:17 mass cancels out

as far as I can read, m is powered by 1 on the left, while m is powered by 1/2 on the right (being under square root). Maybe I'm being wrong or missing something, but if I'm right, you can't cancel out masses in that equation.
Mushrooms can jump, New super mario world (for Wii, DS and 3DS)
hey Austin, loved the vid as always! But for the love of all that is good on dog's green earth can you please stop saying "per second per second" and just say "per second squared"
Sincerely - Me
14:28
What about Mega Strikes in Mario Strikers Charged? Mario and friends make huge jumps to perform it
"Hokay, so ... here's the earth ..." Was that a The End of the World reference?
I love these videos 
Thank you Austin for these videos
That mushroom would gain mass if you continue accelerating, prolonging the time you need to accelerate it further, per Einsteins special theory of relativity.
Dear Austin, HI IT'S ME SLAPSTICK!
I don't think I've ever sacrificed Yoshi. If anything I left him alive as I plummeted to my death.
I have an idea for a video, explanation of the world of Plant Vs Zombies
There's a mechanic 8n SMW where if you hold the jump button you fall slower. 
I don't know if this would effect the numbers.
You can see in the original Super Mario world that the falling-speed of yoshi gets reset when Mario jumps off of him NOW EXPLAIN ME THAT!
Can you do a video about identity v please, thank you.
Austin, you don't look fine...
Is this channel using you like it's personal Yoshi? Like, throwing you down the cliffs of overworking?
Rest in Spaget Yoshi
If his velocity is locked once his feet leave the ground.... then why am I able to change direction and speed.... in mid-air???
Burst into laughter when you said 'why arent you jumping like this all the time?' great video XD
Everytime I here Carmen la chanson du torador, I think of Austin
No not texas, cowboy
Hey Austin, how is mini Austin doing?
Alternate theory: Yoshi is nigh indestructible and possibly the most durable thing in the entire Mushroom Kingdom.
it's called FMA (pronounced Fmah) u need to be a part of game theory channel
What do I see at 1:51?
You don't do this job aloneüòà
could you teach me algebra cause my teacher gives us politician answers
I assumed Yoshi sort of ejected Mario from him by flinging him up. Obviously we don't see this in the animation, but it may explain why Mario can't normally jump that high by himself.
Explain this:






Yoshis flutter
but that's just a theory..






a game theory
Kudos to Tanya and Austin. Really liked the editing in this one.
Kudos to Tanya and Austin. Really liked the editing in this one.
Why was a Doki Doki literature girl in the background of 1:50
My god...


See, this is why I never sacrifice Yoshi.
He also punches him every time yoshi digests something. btw do any of you want a S.F.S.G. badge? ( Safety For Shy Guy)
At 1:43 you can slowly see yuri creeping in on the right
"I messed up my units"
welcome to any mario physics videos!
Austin: 240.23 meters per second squared is the surface gravity

me:..... How the hell do you get that from his height
Hey Austin where's episode 2 of who is the richest video game character
I love your videos Austin please continue.
Just gonna say it.
Austin is cute.
1:51 who else NOTICED yuri?
Kirby: I am the most evil Nintendo character in the universe.

Mario: Hold my beer.
1:50 Uhm... Yuri?... What are you doing, Yuri?.. Yuri!
WAIT! you forgot Yoshi can float.
"hokay, so, this is the earth" that's an old one wow
Ah, I don't usually watch Austin's vids, but this is really fun! I miss Matpat's old style, and it's so nice to see it here. It doesn't feel like Game Theory without it
Remember when the possibility of Mario punching Yoshi was the most of our worries?
1:46 Just look at the bottom right hand corner. Thats all ima say.
It's currently 3:45 AM and I have no clue what's going on... I'm gonna watch later on today when I can better comprehend what tf is going on
6:17 I don't think m cancels out like that...isn't one of them under a radicand? Remember that one is raised to a power of one, and the other by 0.5 (the square root).
yoshi commited tax fraud.
yoshi must suffer
6:16 that's some poor rearrangement you've done there, it should be ‚àö(m)v=‚àö(2ghm), but because you end up taking out the full mass on the left and only the square root of the mass on the right, your mistake has been corrected in the final formula
this is worst Yoshi nightmare ever 



Mario is pure evil 




also all people playing Mario platformer game for only fun
If all the caculations are correct, it is s miracle for mario that Yoshi hasn't  revolted a swallowed the plumber in a mario game.
Serieosly KIRBY THEORY, it has bean 3 WEEKS.
@6:17 How can you cancel 'm' on both sides as the one on right is 'm' squared?
Austin, 
Wonderful research as always. 
Question: Did you calculate or potentially factor in the Yoshi footie wiggle maneuver? Or work to calculate the footie wiggle maneuver?
But Austin!


If the scale of gravity people experience in the mushroom kingdom is so different from our earth, wouldn't it make sense for other forces to scale as well?


Let me try to explain what i mean. If earth was somehow able to exert 4 times the gravity it already does, making us accelerate at 4 times the speed, but still be able to function like normal, wouldn't our "resistance" to newtonian forces be scaled up too? If i was able to withstand 4 times the gravity with no effect on how i do things compared to normal earth gravity, wouldn't it make sense that you have to scale forces like newton in the same way?
If i can take 4 times the gravity, shouldn't i feel no different being subjected to 4 times the newton?


I might be completely wrong, but i always have that thought every time a game has different gravity to ours, but still has normal humans doing normal human things
1:55 nice doki reference......JUST AUSTIN
"Hokay, so here is the earth"
and there's me thinking, that is a sweet earth
"H'okay, here's the Earth" I GOT THAT REFERENCE
When are you continuing the how rich is every character series?
Mario consistently is the most evil character Nintendo has ever made and THAT'S the kind of fun things you can do with mathematical physics.





just give me likes so i can prove my social skills
Just wait for this guy do a vid on apex legends
If I had a dollar for every time this channel measured Mario‚Äôs jump velocity and height, I‚Äôd be set for life.
try dissecting just cause 4's grappling hook
But is Yoshi the richest video game character?
feel like some calculations may have been able to be simplified by doing it with energy rather than forces and kinematics
edit: and possibly may have been more accurate if working with pixels instead of meters and then converting at the very end? so that there wasn't as much rounding in the in-between steps? idk
Think you missed something. OK so Yoshi is a cannibal. OOOOOOH GOD!
OH GREAT HAHA!!

I don‚Äôt get it :/
Fun fact for scale: a crocodile bite (known for their bone crushing greatness) has a force of about 16500 N
So yuri in a dark corner with Austin, ok
"Uh, buddy? I don't think we're gonna make this jump..."

reverses

"Buddy?"



"You motherfu-"
He's not jumping off Yoshi! Yoshi's throwing him!
...Which doesn't make things any better for Yoshi, admittedly.
i know this is an old meme by now but.. is mario stronger than shaggy?
OH NO, it's HIM, AUSTIN
"Hokay, so, here's the Earth." AUSTIN I LOVE YOU
Hey, sorry, hope you don‚Äôt mind, but where is the second episode of the new series ‚Äúwho‚Äôs the richest videogame character‚Äù???
I loved it.
That‚Äôs how we called sacrifice
that song i loved for really long but now my 4YO brother randomly hums the tune and it is REALLY annoying
Can we get a theory on what the chakroads are from Mario and Luigi: Bowsers Inside Story
Doesn't Mario jump super high when using the cape? That could be when he's using 100% of his power.
what about the part where he pauses in mid-air while Mario is jumping off his back
If I had a dollar for every team Austin said velocity, I'd be f*cking rich.
6:17 Did he just cancel out m with m^1/2




Edit: nevermind, it's just that the m on the left side of the equation should be in the square root on the right side of the equation
4:36
Is the song that starts playing here a song that was made for the vid (and if not, what's the name of the song)?
‚ÄúScience is so amazing‚Äù - Ash Ketchum
7:08
Technically the force of the mushroom on the ground and the ground on the mushroom, despite them being equal and opposite is not what Newton's third law is describing. (think about if the ground disappeared under the mushroom: Newton's third law can't suddenly become untrue and disappear because the normal force from the ground disappeared, the whole point is that they are universal laws; they always must apply) Hence Newton's third law in that case is the force of gravity from the mushroom on the ground and the force of gravity on the mushroom from the ground. Otherwise good video.
You are REALLY obsessed with mirage, aren‚Äôt you...
1:50 on the right. ü§™ü§©
Does Austin have a degree on physics or mathematics or something? Just curious cuz I always asumed he did and then realized I don't know if he does lol
Austin:Why don't you jump like this all the time.
Mario:So I don't die, why else.
Finally a video with something i can fully understand :)
1:53 Anyone else notice Yuri being creepier than usual? (On the right)
"seconds per second"
Since Mario never jumps that high without Yoshi, would it not be more feasible that Yoshi is using his own strength to propel Mario up?
1:49 I am so cruel that I won't even Sayori for this joke.
falls over laughing hysterically so I've supposedly splattered that bubbly dino into the ground THOUSANDS of times and jumped right back on him and rode off?! On that not, do a video of Yoshi's bone structure to survive such insanity!
Austin kinda looks like Jason Byrne
If he jumps like that, how much damage should his kicks do in Smash?
I love this intro üòÇ
Just a small thing, the mass doesn't cancel out @6:14
E_pot = E_kin is correct, but you made a mistake while rearranging:
sqrt(m)v=sqrt(2ghm)
A small mistake, but conversion errors are the same. Small but devistating. Just FYI.
I had to convert the values into kilometers per hour to realize how terrifying this is but omg, this cannot be allowed.

I really like to know/see how a Mario game would be like if it had realistic physics, even accepting the higher gravity. (but wouldn't even that make Mario possess a superhuman body?!)
I like matpat more
Jebus Christ Austin. I already felt bad about jumping Yoshi into bottomless pits.
0:36


adjust glass ummm actually Tuttles arent actualy amphibians but are reptile u whould think a man who tried to explain worm whole and teleportation would know the difference smh

(Im honestly just making a joke sry if u get offended :)
I‚Äôm just looking through my subscriptions tryna be a creep to all the youtubers im subscribed to
Reptile....


over the hedge reference-GET
So I was wondering could we use Mario's proven jump height and assume that Yoshi is actually throwing him up at the same time? Basically, would Yoshi's jump strength contribute to Mario's final (assisted) jump height (and accompanying forces)?
The beginning gave me Bioshock vibes so hardly. Especially Infinite
When it said "applied force" said Apple sauce
I miss the Austin that yells profanities while doing science and math
Mario never skips leg day, but luigi curls in the squat rack.
I think he makes the title really long so we can‚Äôt see ‚ÄúThe science of...‚Äù without clicking on the vid.
0:35 it triggered me when he didn‚Äôt get the last coin
I don't think the question has ever been "is it possible" It's super mario, nearly every thing he does defys the laws of physics. The question is "is it moral"

To save the princess/stop bowser is it right to send your friend to their death?
Is Yoshi a friend or just a tool to disregard when need be?
This is the first one I have actually been able to follow along.  Hooray for honors physics class!
I love your videos Austen plz dont ever leave usüíó
1:51  


OOHHH NOOOO
That quick doki doki Easter egg
12:50 if he starts with a velocity of 48m/s he would definitly have a higher velocity at the end. Is it meant to be acceleration?
If you fly with your cape you will never have to sacrifice a Yoshi in SMW.
i miss game theory episodes like this:(
That's already a thing his Smash Bros f-air.
I SAW THAT YURI IN THE BACKGROUND
Did you thought about the terminal velocity of yoshi?
It's high school Physics all over again...
Your videos always have the best music
Considering the animation of the "yoshi sacrifice" shows yoshi launching Mario by exerting energy to "buck" Mario, the calculation should be on yoshi's launching ability, not Mario's jumping.
This is so calming going back to quarter one of physics
What happened to your video top video games character moss rica
6:10 your math was wrong for a sec but it worked out
You took mgh = (1/2) * mv^2 and rearranged it to mv = sqrt(2ghm), which doesn't work because you need to cancel the mass first and then do the rearranging.
Alternatively, you could've gotten v*sqrt(m) = sqrt(2ghm), which would've been right
However, you took your incorrect formula and then canceled m with sqrt(m), which made the result right again. So it works out in the end, I guess
Don‚Äôt worry, Big Yoshi is a good boi and is not his tax evading counterpart
I learn more math and science from game theory than at schoolüòÜ
I saw sexy-Mirage. Hahaha.
"JOIN ME! In the abyss of newtons (okay), kilograms (makes sense.), meters (gotcha), and seconds per second."  

...Wait, what...? Seconds per... what?  Secondception..?  What..?

I used to think I was smart.  Then i heard that.  Can someone explain to me why it's "per second per second" instead of just... meters per second..?
yoshi and mario two best friends forever





Let me just skip to the end real quick





Turns out mario is an a**hole


Oh, oh god
I will never sacrifice my Yoshi. I never thought of that technique before cause losing Yoshi is sad.
HIIIIIII IT'S MEEEEEEE, AUSTINNNNN!!!
If yoshi can survive mario cart, I guess he can survive this.
Where. Is. Part. Two. Of. Gaming's. Richest?!!!!!
"Yoshi, left behind, discarded at the goal!
Turns out that Mario is an asshooooole!"
I look forward to seeing the full Deltarune game to see what other analyses he can make for it.
Make a video about baldis basics birthday bash
Error math overdose, all systems failing nice video though
He seemed really worried recording  the jumps ..or just bored and tired.
Y'all see him cancel mass and the square root of mass because he did the equation backwards
Please do a theory on how many safety regulations Wonder Park is breaking
Yeah, but Yoshi can take nearly anything the marioverse, swallow it, and turn it into an egg in approx. 1.2 seconds.
Loved the Shoddycast TES lore clip lol
6:40 Huh, how ironic. I just finished watching a couple of Super Mario Sunshine Let's Plays.
1:53
Well, well Austin. Let's get you to bed shall we?
6:16 , right term shouldn't have mass inside, or left term should have root-square mass...
9:21 | Skip
Mario is stronger than Thanos. Can we have Mario in Endgame?
P E T A
Okay but all I can imagine now is playing an old school Mario game in 8-bit but when you do this the smashbrows blast effect and would play in modern graphics then Yoshi blasting into oblivion.
Austin scares me ;-;
Why does Yuri start appearing on the right part from 1:46?
Honestly this probably makes  "meteor smashing" in smash bros mind blowing
Yoshi is my favorite character in the Mario games so yeah... This was a fun video....
Now I have to play BioShock again..
My Yoshi! Nnnnooo! Me and Yoshi are best buds! :(
Yo Austin really be comin through sometimes
Hey my dumb friend you know you had a cap that you use for that platform right?
Or just use the blue yoshi to doulbe jump, you uncultered swine
What if it's not mario jumping off, but Yoshi is actually using some sort of back convulsion to throw Mario up on command?
When actually know this because you went to science class
O_O
OH GOD!! RUN AWAY!!!! NOW YOSHI!!! NOW!!!
Couldn‚Äôt mushrooms jump on the music of the stage?
i love watching these vids even if i dont get most of the issac newton law and timesing volocity and stuff
1:53 Yuri from doki doki literature club is in the background
Did anyone see that it was.....

YURI
What font do you use? I've always loved how it looks like a normal persons hand writing
1:51 damn... you got a nice yuri mannequin sex toy behind you!
oh wait... shet...
1:53 She Back, She has snack, but most importantly, she stab your brain 

Yuri needs no rhyme
Haven't watched game theory in a month, now i'm sitting here eating graham crackers binge watching all of these new episodes xd
1:53 why yuri on the right
Did you account for Yoshi's effort in not only the sacrifice, but also during the spring board?

It's possible Yoshi is affecting the jump by kicking Mario higher with a bucking motion. Heck maybe Mario doesn't even jump, maybe it's Yoshi being a badass friend and pushing him off to save him.
mph?? if you use mps you should later use kph, it would make more sense (and more people would understand it).
4:17 The jump is possible. End of episode I guess. WAIT WAIT WAIT THIS VIDEO ISN‚ÄôT TEN MINUTES YET, AUSTIN.
Can you be my physics teacher pls
14:07 *brick wall
You know this video could have been helpful for me to pass my science test a week ago üò©
... yoshi burgers anybody? i hear he's great with mario's secret bbq sauce...
Can't watch another Austin episode.  Too much lol
I hear Austin I stay
So Yoshi should be going extinct
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly...
He break Yoshi's bacc
Sooooooo when do you talk about yoshis "flutter jump"
YURI IN THE BACKROUND! 1:54
yuri wanted that pen ( Õ°·µî Õú ñ Õ°·µî )
Yay it been forever since an austin has been made so yay he back
#NYLB aka No Yoshi Left Behind
I'm glad Austin is branching out to Vivaldi.
Th-thank God Yoshi can flutter
If there is an oppisite Force for every action the jumping on the moon can slowly move it and that's how you can destroy the world
Where is MATPATüòÇüòÇ AUSSTINNN!!!


Hahaha i love this theory cuz he is just like my science teacher in my gr 9 üòÇüòÇ
FINALY  a theory on yoshi
#STOPTHEYOSHISACRIFICE
I still don't know who this guy is
(austin)
r/theydidthemath. 

Also the text you use for showing your numbers it's kinda hard to tell the difference between the letter "S" and the number "5"
Yay, another Austin video!!
6:17 wait, how could mass cancel out if it‚Äôs under the radical on one side but not the other?
You didn't yell too much this episode.
MATH!!!1!!!!!!! I LOVE U ( not kidding)
I want to watch the whole video, but man... Austin's voice.
I feel bad for yoshi 
So many yoshi lives lost
1:50 
Yuri Second Best girl and pro Yandere
Spotted.
14:12 Mr. Bowser, I don't feel so good...
Wait, isn‚Äôt 1kg 9.8 Newton‚Äôs?
But how do you explain double and triple jumps?
did you go to japan with felix?
You did a few mistakes in your calculation report. But instead of complaining about it I want to thank you for entertaining me. That's a very informative Video with a interesting background idea...Well done!üëç
Austin needs an episode where he just dances in the corner while he explains how something in a game is god damn terrifying.
i mean it is MARIO's fault that yoshi needs to fall to his doom, where he won't break his bones cuz mario logic remember?
Wouldn't yoshi way more because hes compressing the spring more and jumping higher?
Yay Austin! I seriously hate Mattpat.
Blue text on thumbnail= Austin 

Green text on thumbnail= matpat
Despite the forces exerted upon him, Yoshi stands tall. His body invincible. Enemies who have the power to hurt the tough man Mario only serve to spook Yoshi. He is indestructible. Mario knows this. He was a baby and felt that power firsthand. Might Yoshi cannot be slain so easily.
Who was that girl at around 1:49 u know the one on the right only visible when the light swings on by 


Oh wait that's some girl (forgot name) from doki doki 







I think
what about the poor goombas...
Because math!!
God, this makes me want to see someone make a physics-accurate Mario World fan game, so we can witness Yoshi rocket into those pits like a bullet
Wouldn't Yoshi be heavier than Mario since it would require more force applied down to send him higher? Since the forces downward would be the same as the forces upward, more force down (more weight) would mean more force up (more height). Less force down (less weight) wouldn't give more force up (more height), meaning that he's 16% heavier, not lighter, right?

This would also make sense with the weights given to them in SSB Ultimate, Yoshi being a low heavyweight and Mario a high middleweight. Smash might not be the best for scaling, but it's at least somethin to go by.
How much force does Luigi place on poor Yoshi?
Hey Austin, i think Mat is proud of you proving even more how evil a hero is
Austin! You missed something, something I think kind of throws a wrench in this whole thing.
When jumping from Yoshi's back, at least in some of the shown things, I think always when he is already on a downward part of the jump... Yoshi pauses, ever briefly, in the air, when Mario jumps off the back...

So... what if it is Yoshi using its flutter jump in a burst to push back up on Mario to give him that boost he seems to get when he jumps off Yoshi's back?... I dunno, just... something I noticed...
Matpat's titles:CLICKBAIT
Austin's titles: hey how about we ACTUALLY TELL WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY
Second/second?
1/1?
The moment he said Netownian Physics I knew this was going to be good.
Great...not this 'Mario's a monster' crap.
#noyoshileftbehind
Just pointing out a minor error in the equations shown (but not in the voice over)
When you say metres per second you show it as ms, but it should be ms^-1 or m/s
And acceleration as metres per second squared is ms^-2 or m/s/s


[EDIT]: you actually showed it correctly while measuring jump force in the second half.. so it's only the pixellated font in the first half with the error


PS: Love your vids, been watching the SCIENCE! for years
Mario doesn't choose to sacrifice Yoshi, the player does. So it's not fair to blame him for it.
Now what about when Mario grows using the mushroom ü§î
This guy is a science genius
Video idea:                                                              mirage from apex legends is a decoy. As shown in his finisher: you the player go up to them and then a ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù comes from the side and punches you but then the original player is gone as if the original player was a decoy and it makes sense bacause he just sent a decoy to play in the apex games while he does whatever he wants
Another idea for a video, in overwatch, Ana's sleep dart has the power to instantly put anyone to sleep, wether it's a 700 pound bullet sponge of road hog, to even dva's mech. So how potent would the stuff in the dart need to be?
Not sec per sec. Everything but that
What if Yoshi is just bucking Mario off as he jumps? Would that be a viable means to impart the extra force?
loved that Doki Doki literature club reference at 1:49
This thumbnail reminds me of the older GT videos.
For why mario only uses this much force on yoshi, you could take into account the situation in which he normally uses the yoshi sacrifice. The fact that he‚Äôs falling into a bottomless pit would likely give home a large burst of adrenaline. The measurements you took for the jump height were also while he was under the effect of a super mushroom, which could could amplify this adrenaline rush in some way.
12:24 can't he just jump higher because he made to jump as showen in Smash and him haveing a double jump recovery insteed of haveing a Up Special to recover?.....
Not sure but if he put more force in his jump he would jump higher even if he weight more... Right?...
In smash Mario weight 98 vs Yoshi 104 So I would say Yoshi is the heavyer of the 2 and Mario is the pen.
+ It make more sence that Yoshi is heavyer as he carry Mario and Mario doesn't carry Yoshi.
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre supporting my favorite character.
Yoshi stops falling for a second after mario jumps off of his back. Yoshi is helping him with his own floaty mechanics.
Y‚Äôall see that anime character in the dark drawing on wall seen on the right?
After u mentioned poor Yoshi's back I lost it.
5:33 When mario has low ping and fps
You say Mario is evil, but he isn‚Äôt the one committing tax fraud...
i think it‚Äôs amazing when Austin is yelling, but then there‚Äôs nice orchestra music in the back
What was theoblivion intro?
You can hear baby‚Äôs voice in some of the fanf 6 voices Liston closely...
If yoshi jumps higher doesn't it mean he weights MORE?
Yoshi Sacrifices are amazing, I always feel a little bad when I do it though.
What if the yoshi pushes Mario during the midair jump instead of the other way around?  That would explain how Mario's jump high on and off of yoshi are different.
10:56-Yoshi is srewd.I already knew this!!
He forgot that springs work differently when different weights are placed on it.
We should create physics-perfect Mario game with all these crushing bones and stuff
I can finally undertand these videos. Thanks grade 11 physics
When he what is saying second per second that was a weird anime girl
Anybody else want Austin in youtubers react? It'll be fun to see Austin pointing out math stuff from random videos
Were is matpat ostin?! Give him back!!!!!!
what about with the moon gravity hack?
Yoshi: Doesn‚Äôt get thrown into a pit

Pit: Am I a joke to you?
Hey Matthew, could you make a theory on how the bad ending of Sonic CD throw works, more so is POSSIBLE?!?!?! Sonic throws a small rock after spin dashing, hitting the Eggomatic and exploding it
A few weeks since this vid went up.....no one has pointed out the Knifu Waifu Yuri at 1:50 when Austin shows us what he does every night
1:53 Watch out Austin! Oh no he can‚Äôt hear us he‚Äôs got science in his ears!
1:47 i see yuri sneakin in on our right
Lol, that'll teach him to commit tax fraud.
I feel like this problem would be easier with momentun
Do Minecraft steve
6:17 Actually mass wouldn‚Äôt cancel out because mass on the left side is m to the first power, and mass on the second side is under the square root (meaning that mass is m to the 1/2 power).
I saw yuri in the background
If Mario always exerts that much force then bowser must cause earthquakes seeing as he often jumps even higher than Mario
Anyone else see a person from DDLC when he was talking about writing on the walls?
at 6:30 the m on the left should have a square root sign
4:39 damn that is a sweet earth you might say
Hi it's me, ANXIETY!
My poor brain it isa video game doesn't have real physics
(14:28) Austin: Why are u jumping like that!  me: Hes nicknamed jumpman for a reason
You forgot to factor the Mario can possible use both of his arms and legs when jumping from Yoshi, accounting for that extra height
well, you said that because of the difference in heights in the spring, yoshi should weigh less but, he could be just jumping in the spring, less than the normal jump but enough to make that kind of change, the ideal should be 
try to discover his weight so that after Mario's jump his downward speed changed how much it changes (
I think that happens in other games)
this is just Mario is Mental Part 3 lol.
Poor Yoshi.
I could've sworn we've figured everything out that there is on mario jumpman mario
Who else saw Yuri behind him
1:53 Yuri is in the background.
1:46 who saw HER
This is how many times Yoshi was thrown down a cliff
üëáüòì
Mario really only ever kills one amphibian I think you were looking for the word reptile since turtles are reptiles
When are you continuing the richest video game character series?
Feels like im in physics class when i watch one of this
Hold on a second, if you push on 2 newtons for infinite amount of time it will have no velocity because the never ending amount of time will mean you will never push it

1:53 Doki Doki Literature Club
so... I'm I the only one who saw the anime girl from that psycho scary video game (I suck at names) behind Austin on the right hiding in the swinging light at 1:50
You gotta do one on how much force the Jetpack from Jetpack joyride generates
I like how he is slowly making an intro with clips from videos
Don't show minute 6:17 to your physics teacher
Baldis b√°sics birthday bash theory!!!!
Your units man
There is something that I think you might have overlooked. Maybe the reason Yoshi can jump higher isn't because it's lighter but maybe he's stronger. Yoshi is a dinosaur after all.
Yoshi isn‚Äôt hurt by these forces that are being applied to it.
So I guess yoshi must be made of tough stuff
I was learning about Newton's laws today
Now I want to know something. How powerful is a POW blast?
Speaking of jumps, can you or mattpatt do a theory on how much damage Mario and Luigi's jump attacks on enemies can do? Especially  Mario and Luigi's super jump (referring to Super Mario RPG and Super Paper Mario)

Note: not just the landing, but also the Paper Mario series seems to imply the ability to inflict damage when they're traveling in upward velocity. E.g. flying enemy overhead, super jump underneath them, velocity of impact from below the enemy equals damage to enemy
Did Austin just make an end of ze world joke???
Looks like I finally made it to one of game theory`s later videos
Wait some Mario weighs 89 kg?  like 300 lbd?
Seconds per seconds? Excuse me..?
But if we increase preasure of air (wich is natural in higer gravitation anyway) math completly change... so, you know.
@6:12 you change that formula all wrong... you show us initially mgh=.5mv^2  And say that simplifies to mv=‚àö(2mgh)  ... THIS IS WRONG what it should say at this point leaving mass in is ‚àö(m)v=‚àö(2mgh) ... otherwise mass does NOT cancel out with the incorrect way you wrote it.  Or did you forget to take the square root of EVERYTHING!!
It would make more sense to cancel mass out first and then take the square root, and it would look cleaner in your explanation.
3:18 a thot expirament 




Easy just pull out some money
uhhhh yuri? ya good? am i the only one who notticed? idk, so um.........nope... 1:51.....

Austin's intro voice makes me want to have been born without ears.
No Yoshis were harmed or dropped in the making of this video.
How do we know that Yoshi doesn't sacrifice himself and throw Mario off his back to save Mario's life?
I would personally prefer if they looked at how durable Mario characters are, as if in what they have survived and they could resist because i know for a fact Yoshi can definitely survive that impact since he's survived worse
Can you please do one on jump force
Mario+Yoshi√óJump=Bad did I do it right is that the equation? but actually great work Austin this episode was great
1:53 get outta here Yuri
"ITS A ME. AUSTIN!!!" 
me "Oh no...."

Also love the doki doki sneak there. Haha
Her name Yuri right? Someone correct meh!!!
Captain Falcons Punch
Honestly I'm starting to enjoy these because science episodes more than actual game theory.
Mario vs Shaggy I want to see it now
That is honestly a big RIP in the chat for yoshi
i watch these videos before my physics exams and there so helpful so thanks
Can I just point out:
11:48
Why in the everloving FRICK is Waluigi heavy?
Even more of a reason why Mario is a phyco maniac
How do the "M" variables in the velocity equation cancel out???.  One of them is under the square root.
Very nice ‚ÄúEnd of Ze World‚Äù reference around 4:40.
Wait, the mass in the left side of the equation wouldn't cancel out with the square root of mass on the right side. To single out velocity, you'd have to divide both sides of the equation by mass, meaning your velocity would be way smaller.
1:51 oh hi Yuri
Objects with mass can‚Äôt go the speed of light :)
The Yoshi Sacrifice is probably why I think I'll be able to survive a plane crash by jumping out of it at the last second.
The reason Mario wouldn't jump at max all the time is because the higher you jump the harder it is to land. I'm not talking impact, I'm talking positioning your body so you can keep moving, which is what makes things like parkour difficult. Neglecting the increased forces and whatnot because of his clearly superhuman anatomy, he would be more likely to get an injury like a twisted or sprained ankle after jumping the greater distance.
4:39
End of ze World reference. Nice!
When are you going to upload those videos about the richest game character
i used FMA on my physics test, i failed
Hey Austin,

I just watched the video so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but at 12:02 when you were calculating Yoshi‚Äôs mass couldn‚Äôt you keep it in Super Mario World? If you measured Mario on the spring then Mario and Yoshi on the spring could you just subtract Mario‚Äôs mass?
Wait, Wouldn't yoshi be heavier because he is putting more force into the spring and bouncing higher?
Me: turns on ‚ÄòEnglish auto-detect‚Äô captions. 
Austin: Yoshi sacrifice
YT: yo she sacred ice
Me: üòÇ Laughs uncontrollably until near death
Also Me: stops laughing, turns off captions and continues to enjoy video
i have so much love and respect for austin
rip mah yoshi
I have a question about fnaf. In ucn if we r playing as william afton who is in springtraps suit
I was playing super Mario world and I had yoshi I dont know if I should kill him yet
When is the next part of The Science 
Of Video Game Millionaires?
3:49 I did that with a book and hit myself in the head




Big oof
If yoshi gets hit on by major impact, should you call a doctor, or a paleontologist?
4:39 but I'm Le tired
Yuri is there... NOOOOOOO!!!
You should include also the km/h results. Neather m/s or Mph doesn't have nothing for us outside us to compare to (like a car speed)
What music did you use? Particularly the guitar bit.
lol you're hyping the difficulty of this problem up so much u know how to solve this in less time than an hour. how you talking about how this kept you up at night annoyed me
I just ligit learned this stuff in physics...
austin is the best in the shoddy cast just sayin'
0:58 Never mind; the puzzle game Yoshi was released in 1991, though its' concept dates back to 1989.
Also, FTR...I never do that. Yoshi is more useful to me as a mount than as a boost.
So what you‚Äôre saying is that Mario basically meteor smash/spikes yoshi
3:40 you used upside down fishbowls for the spacesuits
Why hello there Yuri
When rearranging your formula for initial velocity at 6:10, make sure you cancel out the masses BEFORE you throw a square root over the top of that second mass there on the right. To further explain why this shouldn't happen, you're technically only working with v^2=2gh. Throwing a square root over a mass and then dividing a mass without a square root under that doesn't simply cancel out.


I am no mathematician or physicist. Just a concerned viewer for any of the youngsters first hearing about simple kinematics that might use this video in the future to teach themselves how to calculate such forces, speeds, heights, etc.


.... I love "The SCIENCE of..."! Please don't stop!
Notification squad What up
1 cookie per like starting with mine 
üç™
3:20 small suggestion free fall would have been a slightly easier way of explaining it.
Austin is not awesome
But what if yoshi doesn't way less then Mario and instead just happens to have stronger legs
Anyone else think that crack on the left of the screen was on your monitor?
Someone made a 5 on their AP Physics test...
If I remember correctly isn‚Äôt there a game where wario can ride yoshi?
Since there so many smart people here, can someone answer my question?
If a black hole is the most dense object and can therefore trap light under its event horizon, doesn't that mean that objects achieves a higher velocity than lightspeed at some point if they get accelerated towards the black hole?
Jumping 16% higher while jumping on a spring you have to be heavier (did that English right? You know what I mean)
I'd just like to comment on your math with the speed of light: when you are talking about low speeds, just adding acceleration together is fine. BUT, when talking about speeds at fractions of the speed of light or higher, they don't actually just add up
Austin: -"Hokay, so, here's the Earth.."
My brain: -"S'chillin. Damn, that's a sweet earth you might say. ROUND!"
I'm on to you Austin!
1:50 Yuri best girl agreed!
Wait, wouldn't the amount of force exerted on yoshi's back kill him before he hits the ground?
Wait.... where‚Äôs matpat I‚Äôm new so I don‚Äôt know him üò∂üôÉ
who else saw  yuri
Personally I never did this, Mario games are easy enough
Mario never Skiped leg day.
When is the richest video game characters pt 2 coming out Austin??
Don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt see Yuri back there
Next theory, please please can you do the physics and power needed for the Mario helicopter power form new super Mario bros wii
new mario game idea!
Mario: One Jump Man
#LetAustinCurse
Who or where is the good in the Mushroom kingdom?!
HEY IT'S ME! AUSTIN
what if every one is rubber
This is what yoshi must deal with to pay for all his years of committing tax fraud....
Bendy is back. So.......
anyone seen yuri in the video?
the Scene where You said that You are crazy because of your work  1:36-1:41 (Maybe), wasn¬¥t there the crazy chick from Doki Doki Literatur club?
This is GOD DAMN TERRIFYING!!!!!
You're still off for the speed of light thing. Things don't accelerate at all linearly, if you exerted a constant force on a constant mass then the force required in classical mechanics to reach the speed of light would in relativistic physics only get you about 80% of the way there. The faster you go the more energy it take to get you the same speed increase and as v^2 approaches c^2 that energy gets big. In order to get really close to the speed of light you'd require a lot force for a lot longer than any sort of classical mechanics predicts.
I only ave three brain cells left after all that math
So an emphasis on "sacrifice".
Can you do a beyond you theory?
AUSTIN I MISSED YOU
"...amphibian murderer extraordinaire"
*Shows Turtles
TRIGGERED
was that a god damn end of ze world joke
I prefer Austin
Please do a video on how the planets in no mans sky are too close and would be ripping each other to shreds because they are in each other‚Äôs Roche limit
Who‚Äôs in the background at 1:49
Just kill the only guardian you have, aka the one reason you‚Äôre alive
yuri wants the pen 1:51
Mario can change direction in midair - a necessary and important gameplay mechanic that has no basis in physics. UNLESS. Unless. unless MARIO has a JETPACK in his PANTS.
is your metric for calculating yoshi's weight flawed in that its a jump pad and yoshi jumps higher than yoshi naturally?
Wait if Mass is in the radical, wouldn‚Äôt it be the square root of mass? In that case, how would you cancel it out
Ok austin quick question, could u plz convert some of the units to Australian units cause i cannot even with miles
Great brain treat as always. Just wanted to point a mistake at 12:20
Let's go back to our Newton's third law. The spring sends back up either Mario or Yoshi with the same force that's been applied to it going down. Left alone with no active force, only their weight applies here. With and equal and opposite force from the spring, if Yoshi did weigh less, it would send him up to a lesser height than Mario.

BUT, by Newton's first law, a lighter mass requires less force to be given the same original speed as that of an heavier object, which that object provides to be given the same speed (by conservation of momentum). In some way, the two cancel out.

In the end, even if their masses differ the only determinant for the height you measured should be the original height. Thus, we cannot infer mass based on reactive height.
Mario too, can land with that much (or more) force....their biology is different and fictional
#StopYoshiAbuse
This was actually covered in the ultra instincts Shaggy video when it was figured out how many Newton of energy would have to be exerted in order for Shaggy to successfully jump from one falling rock to another on an upward path.
This is how I'm studying for my science final examüëç
Did Austin mean to reference the End of Z world at 4:40
Did you see one of the doki doki characters when he is in the room coverd with red marker
1:50 i see u yuri
Does Smash Have Gravity! Ha.
We shouldn't turn this concept into a meme. It will probably be banned by Article 13.
Am I the only one who is triggered by saying "meters per second" but writing "ms" instead of "m/s"?
12:32 first of all, im not familiar with this math, but you say 16% higher is 16% less mass, but that doesnt sound right to me because something without mass would jump 100% higher but that is not the case.
Saw Yuri at 1:50 on the right
Austin over here with the gamer chin
1:50 YURIS IN THE BACK ROUND!!! It's been a while since we got a Doki Doki reference bois
They don't call him Jumpman for nothing...
Got no idea about the SCIENCE! yet, but if anyone tries to say that Mario sacrificing Yoshi is terrible, remember that if he didn‚Äôt do so, they‚Äôd both die. So one of them might as well make it to their destination. I‚Äôve been wanting to say this for a while. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
I think in this analysis we failed to account for Yoshi's "flying" abilities. It is conceivable that Yoshi is helping Mario jump by exerting force upward during the "Yoshi sacrifice".  In many games, Yoshi has the ability to hover briefly in the air. Perhaps Yoshi has a reserve to do this once again just for Mario's sake to help propel Mario to greater heights.
Austin looks beautiful dancing
A minute of silence for all the Yoshis that died because of all the Marios...







F
People act like Mario is a terrible person for sacrificing Yoshi, but I mean the two options are to fall with him or to jump off. Either way Yoshi dies; if Mario chooses to go down with him who will save the princess?

Plus it's not Mario who's doing this, the player controlling him is. YOU are the evil one.
wow... were`s matpat?
No, yoshi is just very elastic
Shouldn‚Äôt it be 108 feet
Why are all the Mario videos by Austin. I love him but I just wish MatPat would cover these topics once and a while. Tbh
YOSHI CAN FLY 13:10
He really is a sociopath
1:59 Yuri?
1:52 dont think I didn't seen your new frind right there!
So...; Mario can jump a meter higher than the world record of height jump, without run-up and on a world with four times Earth's gravity.... Yeah, I'm sure that's the fact he can jump on Yoshi that is a problem XD
I dont understand math but i think the yoshi sacrafice is making the physcics broken
Mario v Kirby, a battle for the ages
Oh i can hear peta knocking the door,oh boy
Yuri!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I clicked on and was like...
Looks like someone did attend his physics classes
Anyone else noticed Yuri?
Did anyone else see the doki doki girl on the right of the screen when the Light was swinging
But we're not going to address Yoshi's foot wiggle levitation
You didn't say "ze ennnd"
7:53 wait the force is equal to Mario?
Don't worry about Yoshi. A mere 10000-ish Newtons is nothing compared to what that dinosaur has dealt with. Like the time he sent Raphael the Raven INTO ORBIT! And that's being generous too! He might have escaped the gravity of the planet entirely (as entirely as you can escape gravity, that is).
"consistantly the most evil"


KIRBY AND RIDLEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
face reveal?
do a sonic theory
4:39 I see what you did there
WHERES :
MAT CATPAT >:(
I MISS MAT üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
4:39 Holy Marios moustache that's an old reference!
5:55 mario DOES continue to exert a jumping force after he leaves the ground. if you let go of the jump button mid-jump, he stops moving upwards.
 you have to continue holding jump without letting go to achieve maximum jump height.
I miss matpat you are the most complex person
1:52 i see you Yuri
My brain hurts now.üòÇ
Can't you use the conservation of momentum here. Just curious
hi yuri
1:49 There's Yuri.
Who on earth did your rearranging for the velocity equation? The end answer is right, but the step is wrong. The "m cancels out" should have been the first thing?
you forget one thing Austin.. You calculated that their gravity is 4Gs that means that evolutionary speaking their bones would be denser and many more biological changes meaning that they could withstand more force applied to them
It's a you:

Game theory
9.8 m/s^2, not ft
Mystic messenger theory pls
At 6:13 someone forgot about putting mass into a square root
OwO Austin is dummy thicc
Damn bro, what did Yuri do to you there. I really need to assure your safety my guy.
What if the Phantom's are only trying to get spring-trap in Five Nights at Freddy's 3
Mat?....pat???üò¢
He seems fine to me
At least give Yoshi a parachute
Yoshi the Kenny of Mario
Yoshi is a Phoenix

I always thought you would have to contact Nintendo and ask to use their content and then if they agreed pay them for the use of the content. It would be expensive but it might hold up in court if u get sued. Better to be safe than sorry. If they said no u would have to find different content to use and continue the process. But it might be better than the alternatives which I don‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt work for YouTube but I guess it probably involves money and lawyers and possibly being demonetized or banned from YouTube. 
Do YouTubers ask to use some ones content in their videos? At least sight  the sources of the content. Give credit where credit is due.
4:39 That's an OG meme
I am I the only one who's never sacrificed Yoshi??????????? 
        





Please don't kill me.
NO JOKE MY REAL NAME IS AUSTIN TOO (SPELLED THE SAME!)
You need to go outside now and again as its showing ...big time.
You need to update your ashes age sooooo GOOD LUCK
In memory of yoshi.
Yoshi is but a tool to be used and discarded.

(Also thank you for easing up on your yelling I love your content and your focus on math and science üíôüíõ)
This also had an appearance in one of the Amazing World of Gumball episodes!
Hay austin hears some coffie makeing tips for the perfect coffie 1: use cold filterd water
2: messure your coffie use 2 tablespoons of ground coffie for every 6 ounces of water
3: water temperature needs to be between 195¬∞ - 205¬∞. If you boil water let it sit for 30 seconds befor useing it (water boils at 212¬∞ witch is a little too hot to brew coffie)
4: rinse your filter with hot water befor brewing. Use a good quality oxygen bleached filter.
5: pour just enough water over the grounds (wet not saturated) to let them bloom (they get puffy).
After 30-45 seconds continue the pour over. This will get the most flavor from your coffie.
6: drink your freshly brewed coffie within 30 minuts of brewing. Dont let coffie sit in a brewer all day long. Make it as you need it.
Your the reason I still watch this channel
Mario would be the better Superman if he was on earth. Wait no. Like that one punch man part where he jumps off the moon.
Wow, Austin. I thought we had already established that Mario was a murdererüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Admit it, you don't even pay atention to the "The SCIENCE" in the tittle and expect another theory video, you dislike xD
Yoshi is secretly god
I was piss poor at physics so I appreciate you explaining it all
yes I agree with all of your science Ligma is a problem...... this... this is a... Mario video!?!?!?
Mario is crazy
and a commie too
hey, Yoshi, I'm fat and lazy
bye bye, boo!
comment, if you were here for Mario, is a Sociopath and Mario is a Communist. And all those times Matpat tried to calculate his weight and height
I think you need to take a look at using mario as a ruler again because you used his mushroom form as the base height when in reality it doubles his height. it might just end up making the jump more powerful.
Bring mat back
is that yuri from ddlc i see?
i like the video for it
Frank Hourigan?
I mean I love the science, but the rush of the music as Austin gets excited is even better
epa, que paso en 4:36?
so wait..how does yoshi magically always come back in an egg after you 'killed' him?
Now I wonder how he feels about the episode, 'Helping Hand' from LOVE DEATH & ROBOTS...
Hii it's me aUsTIn
1:53 WHO ELSE SAW YURI 0A0
1:46 did anyone see Yori
Me and yoshi always die together
mass cancels out while one is underneath a square root??????????
1:53 YURI
You can't eliminate mass from the ecuation because in one side is inside the square root
Pls put km/h too
So does this mean that moon jump hacks are canon?
What is the song played during part of the show off of Mario at the beginning
you can't cancel mass with the square root of mass!
Well we found out why the dinosaurs went extinct: Mario killed them all
At 1:52 around there kn the dark in the right did anyone see the anime girl walking up in the back
You thought the sacrifice was the worse thing...
Keep in mind Mario often lands on-top of Yoshi after similar, 'non-sacrifice,' type jumps....
6:17 mass doesnt actually cancel out because the mass on the left is just mass whereas mass on the right of the equation is the square root of mass.
0:25 "Mirage! Quiet!"
Did this man just say Yoshi was introduced in super mario world? Boi how do you know all these facts but don't know Yoshi had a game on the NES
Despite everything, I still and always will believe that Yoshi sacrifices himself to save Mario from death
Those who stoped watching before 15:19 missed out on a good laugh
More VIVALDI!
Wait if his jump is so powerful why doesn‚Äôt he break his arm every time he hits a block of bricks
Anybody saw yuri 1:50
YURI NO
Please answer this question :
What is in the abiss that Mario falls in that kills him
Nintendo really has their mailbox full...
How do we know if Yoshi isn't exerting force on mario
Who is that person in the background?! 1:52
When Austin is starting to make better content than MatPat
Mario is the real villain and Bowser is the actual hero.  lol
I can't believe the he been here for nine years
just monika
Please do a video of Mario was on Earth. How much stronger would he be to a human? Will be be faster? Etc.
Yeah, but it doesn't happen, yoshi falls just as fast after mario jumps off him. Yoshi doesn't fall faster... What is the point of this video?
That Vivaldi Four Seasons killed me.
It would be funny for him to try to solve the age-old question: How do the bricks and question blocks float?
I preferred Austin when he was louder
Is that monika at 1:50? Or am I just losing my mind?
1:52 who Saw the anime girl?
Dear Austin. I realised that you did a mistake. The unit of acceleration is m/s¬≤ not m*s =>(ms). 07:00
But the question is how strong is Yoshi
Jesus Christ yoshi
So uhhh... Austin umm... What were you uhh doing there with yuri? In uhhh... Your room?
Yoshi looks like he stops falling when mario jumps off his back when going downwards. So that would negate mario's downwards momentum, right?
What ever happened to the richest video game characters
To much mathematics
i can safely say my brain hurts now
At 9:00 you forgot to include relativistic effects. You would need more time to accelerate your object, due to its inertia
Anybody notice Yuri from DDLC creeeeeping in on Austin during the insane scene? At approx  1:44 to 1:53  on the right side of the screen.
Still waiting for part 2 of the Mass Effect 3 ending
You forgot one thing Austin? You forgot the gravity! In the beginning of the video gravity would be strong than Jupiter but you took back, now at the end he jumps 114feet but how much would gravity pull him back down by, and also I LOVE THESE VIDEO KEEP THEM COME YOU THE BEST AUSTIN!!!!!
He doesn‚Äôt realize  his ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù wall is made of bricks
Leave it to Yoshi to once again, never miss leg day. It could kill you
Ayyy Austin is still a jpg
The real reason it‚Äôs dangerous is because you are breaking the trust of your only friend on this island.
it's been a month and still no p 2 of Kirby
I still want to know who is the richest videogame character, Austin
HOW DARE YOU NOT SAY FMA
1:53 who else saw yuri.
Yes. I needed this. I don't know why, but I did.
The mushroom would never reach c
Would the science apply to the super hat too ?
What happened to the richest character theory?
I'm learning Newton‚Äôs 3 laws
Mario knows what he‚Äôs going, he needs to get rid of yoshi fast to make oil
wow...
with the equation given @ 6:34 how would mass cancel out if on the one side its m^1 and on the other it's m^.5 cause it is under the sqrt sign. Unless it wasn't supposed to be under the sqrt sign, just going off of the given information
he knows how to flutter duh
It's so much fun with maths in metrics and imperial outcome
You ruined my childhood, but heck I still love u
Just a heads up at 6:14 the m on the left also needs to be square rooted
But he can fly
Can you do Caroline please I found out some theories about it and I want to see if you can find something about it Two piece them together And I wish they made a second one
3:27 are those helmets filled with water?!
You made a mistake when you canceled the mass out at 6:17. The mass on the right is inside the square root (m^(1/2)), so they don't cancel.
What happened to that Gmail opening?
What about Yoshis flutter ability when hes in the air? Cant he do that on his way down to slow his decent?
Yoshi should have paid his taxes
"Mario is guilty of murdering Yoshi because of this optional thing that you never have to do".
???
Hey this is for matpat so did stef fell when she had olavar
#NYLB
Rosalina is " heavy "
1:53 Yuri, is that you?
So mario is heavier than yoshi....Time to go on a diet mario
Yoshi should have taken baby Mario and dropped him into the ocean if he was only going to kill him for some extra jump height when he got older.
well what if not only mario exerts force on yoshi but yoshi pushes him too (with his little arms) to save his life instead of them both dying? (yoshi saved mario before when mario was a baby so i dont think this is too implausible)
that means mario might not be exerting that much force
WHAT U LOST ME AT THE MUSHROOM
That wasn‚Äôt a concrete wall
Sorry I'm late! Oh, hi Austin!
YAY SHODDY
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the gravitational constant 36.4 ft/s and 9.8 m/s?  (Don't hate me Austin I love youuuuuuuuuuu)
Mathematical!
Somebody get Austin a doctor
I would love ‚Äúthe science of‚Äù if the narrator wasn‚Äôt so high strung and annoying...
1:50 anyone else notice yuri the stalker
Austin dancing was more terrifing than mario
Dang I'm only 10 and still taller than Mario
Sonic May run fast but Mario now show to jump
1:53 yuri what are you doing
Poor Yoshi...
Wow a dokie dokie literature club Ester egg look at the right side of the screen at 1:47
it,s over 9000
But Yoshi deserves it because he committed tax fraud
Poor Yoshi :(
Oh Geez, this Video made me realise that I am missing years. You know you are getting old, when you yourself get your age wrong.
Yoshi is a tool
Jump while throwing a bowling ball in the air you will fall faster trust me....
Mario isn‚Äôt messing around on leg day
OMG somebody sue Mario poor Yoshi!
Doesn‚Äôt yoshi kind of float so you did not need to do that really
At 1:50 did anyone else notice the the creepy girl behind Austin?
I petition to make Austin dancing the end card of every video from now on
Is this not a game theory episode?
4:36 I like the song
Mario must have never skipped leg day to jump with a force of nearly 10,000N
Austin is better than Mat Pat don't @ me.
What‚Äôs the classical music at the start? I could make a meme with it... I need to know the name of it.
Would Mario get hurt from the fall
Its probably worse if you consider that maybe yoshi is tossing mario up as he jumps in order for him to be jumping higher
Omg a  new salad fingers üò±üò±üò±üò±
C,mon where's my little nightmares theory i've been waiting for.
What about P speed?? He jumps higher...
1:50 sooo, I think you have a waifu.
rip yoshi
Did anyone else notice Yuri? 1:45
Mario does jump 38m, it's called pressing jump 3 times.
A spring will not apply a uniform force, it will apply a force equal to whatever force you apply just opposite, so the jump height they reach should be the same.
I know you related everything back into the real world to compare these forces/speeds to but isn't that cheating a bit? I mean these mushroom land people live on a planet that has gravity 4 times more than earth, so they are used to these sorts of forces. How bad would these jumps be if you related them back to the force of just standing still on that world like a percentage perhaps?
mario is a war criminal
Nintendo definitely wanted to make Yoshi sacrifice make sense. üòÇxD
1:50 bottom right
Title: Don‚Äôt jump!
Me: How bout I do anyway
1:52 ...Did you mean meters per second...?
bad austin!
why is this so relaxing to me?
WHY LEAVE THE LATIN OUT
We need to know how long and what speed Yoshi toungue is and how deep his stomach is with and without an enemy to destroy.
Hokay, here's the Earth, and here's Mario... 'Damn, that is a pretty sweet Mario' you might be sayin- WRAONG!!
That is one dead yoshi either way. 


Edit: Austin I don't know if you will see this but I guess its worth a shot, something always bothered me in the Kirby anime (Remembered by Mats new kirby videos). One episode Meta knight can use the tip of his sword to force the stomping foot of a huge stone golem up, but then some episodes later 2 characters where dangling from inside of a volcano from a rope. Given his ungodly strength I was surprised when he basically told 4 kids to pull them out, and when it was obvious they weren't able to do it at first- instead of "I got this" he (in the japanese version, they changed his cursing when dubbed) instead yelled "DAMMIT, PULL!". My question is how strong/ durable would meta knight and his blade need to be to stop the golems attack?
Wow!!!
My brain hurts
Can you guys play then do a theory on Radiant One   ? It‚Äôs a game on the App Store and i think it may be a cool theory ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è (this is my first time suggesting so I‚Äôm excited) thanks!!!
Do a gtav online game theory
Bioshock theory pls
Wait in the equation at 6:15 mass does not cancel out... one side is m and the other is root m
Easy: Yoshi is made of Flubber. This is why he's practically invincible. He wears boots to prevent bouncing, and shell prevents mario from bouncing off randomly.
Wait a minute, since an equal amount force is going into Mario under Newton's 3rd law, then shouldn't the Yoshi sacrifice completely destroy them both?
if he jumped like this all the time he would not need to sacrifice yoshi he could make the jump
i wonder how much thought or intrigue Nintendo has if they see these videos
Mario vs goku
Austian, are you related to frank horrigan?
Ooooh! A new game theory video.
"Intro starts"
Hold up, where's my ears?
Austin showing off his drugs by his desk
Where is Matt? Is he okay?
But yo she didn't die and what about Kirby eats everyone
hey any updates on that richest videogame person yet?
Poor, poor Yoshi
6:13 , i think it isnt possible to cancel out both masses since one of them is the Mass and the other one is the Square Root of the mass, right?
I mean as far as i can remember the result is ok, because the two original formulas are m*v2=mgh, which means, masses can be cancelled out, and then the squared velocity can be passed as the square root of the gravity times the height, which ends up being the same result, but still, its kind of misrepresented in the video, i think.
why are your significant figures so random? tisk tisk
What happened at 6:13 - 6:18? Math doesn't work that way
I wonder how much difference there would be in Mario jumping off Yoshi's back with vs. without the mushroom...
so if mario uses yoshi as a sacrefice.....and if the game was oppisite...WOULD YOSHI SACREFICE MARIO!?!?!? (and ride him...)
What is that song called at 11:28
Ouch this hurt ;-;
Rip yoshi. qq
What happens to matpat
1:58 yuri? or monika?
M I the only one who got the reference of "ok so here is the earth " ?
Bowser trapped Yoshi in that egg for him to not to be turned into luigi's side b in smash by mario, but failed
Y'all are bad at math smh
As soon as I realize it‚Äôs not matpat, I click off. This new guy is way too annoying
Witj all the science stuff happening around mario games, we might as well figure out why mario should stop breathing and cause destruction in our planet
Mario is a War Criminal
Mario ls bad
im listening and i hear austin. Austin + Informercials + Mario = Good episode.
10:17 Pardon, the BASICS?
Also I thought this week was Kirby theory, or am I just crazy?
Love the outro btw.
i feel bad for yoshi
6:17 That mass looks like it is under the square root, although it shouldn't be. If it was you wouldn't be able to cancel it out
1:53 did anyone else see Yuri
I really dont know how to scale m/s
Umm... Springs don't work like that. Following hookes law, the height Mario or yoshi bounce off a spring would only depend on the "impact velocity"
Not to mention Mario is heavier than Yoshi meaning the strain put on Yoshi‚Äôs back without the jump is probably enough to cause chronic back pain... poor Yoshi needs to be saved!!
You know that the fideo will be good when the whord sacrefice coms in it
roses are red   
violets are blue 
i hate mario
so do you
would not mario legs brake too?
Mass doesnt cancel out in 6.25
13:18 the time counter is 69
0:26
1:45 yuri in the corner
Wow üòÆ this is so complicated I DID THIS IN GCSE SCIENCE
Does anyone else like austin more than matpat
6:16 mass most certainly does not cancel out one of those m's is under a square root buddy
6:17 but wait, how is m canceling out? On the left side its m, on the right side its the aquare root of m ;P
I'm already Insane it's Mentally and Physically Impossible to make me more insane!

1:25
6:17 somebody did their math wrong
Dude. You need to make horror movies based on terrifying physics, the present it to smart people who really want a scare.
The only thing I‚Äôm terrified at is that ominous yuri behind Austin...
Yoshi's inertia will make mario's feet pierce through him
Mario mario cool game
My headcanon is that when you sacrifice a Yoshi to jump across a wide chasm, it‚Äôs Yoshi throwing Mario off his/her back to get him across the chasm. It‚Äôs just ad heartbreaking, but less cruel.
Am I the only one that noticed the girl form doki doki literature club at 1:47 on the right of the screen
Who am I watching rn this is so wired
Mario is a true horror game
1:53
This is why I don't play Mario games?
Austin: "Hhhokay, so here's the earth."
Me: "Damn, that's a pretty sweet earth."
....*reptile murderer
where iskirby pt 2????
pleays yell more
I'm sorry. I can't understand anything u just said cause i'm still in grade 6! In Indonesia
Austin, i think you mad a lil mistake. I dont think that m cancels out.
Fma fma fma fma
1:40 Someone needs Head & Shoulders shampoo
where's part 2 ?
km/h anyone?
welp, looks like Mario could have another spike aerial
Can Austin have his own channel?
Why was there half a second of the Elder Scrolls Lore series at the beginning? Are we getting an Elder Scrolls Science Hour soon-ish?
1:53 Y-Yuri?..
1:51 yeet yuri
The crazy thing about Newtonian physics is that now my brain can't stop thinking about this. How fast is Yoshi shot downwards from a terminal velocity jump? How gruesome will the visceral explosion be when he crashes into the ground? What would the radius and depth of the resulting crater be? And of course, most importantly, how many Yoshis being shot downwards by jumping Marios would it take for the impact to cause world-ending devastation to an earth-like planet? 





uuuhhhh.... crap, not again.
The only child hood they didn't ruin for me is phineas and ferb
But what about minecraft's faoting items?
Kinda funny because this is the concept that I learned about in school today
No no where's matpat
where's matpat :(
6:17 ... mass does not cancel out, m doesn‚Äôt equal root m??
Its obviously yoshi magic
And there go‚Äôs my good childhood memories with mario
soooooo are we just going to ignore yuri in the background at 1:53?
Why use meters and then mph, use kilometres ( metric system superior)
Am I the only one who hates this Austin dude?
I think I like Austin better than mattpus now. I‚Äôm team Austin....Are you????
Forget classical physics. Somebody give me Austin‚Äôs classical playlist.
Isn't rest a constant velocity?
6:17 Wait, how do you mean mass cancels out. One is mass and the other is the square root of mass. They do not cancel out, and the whole thing from that point forward is horribly wrong.

Edit: No, wait, the mass shouldn't have been inside the square root to begin with. What a mess.
Anybody notice Yuri at 1:51 ?
1:54 i saw that
5:20 almost gave me a heart atack because underA theres a wight line and sometimes my screen gets hit by things
Did.. I miss something or did he just say the square root of the mass cancels out the mass? Certainly what he's showing in the video at least. Doesn't work like that.
Maybe it's not mario being fat, maybe its the form his body had to take to work in this high gravity ü§î
At 6:17 mass does NOT cancel out like that
Why doesn‚Äôt Mario jump that high all the time? The same reason Sonic doesn‚Äôt break the sounds barrier every chance he gets: control and usage. Just because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you can make good use of it whenever you feel like it, and since you are effectively at the whim of gravity while airborne, it is probably in Mario‚Äôs better interest to only use this to avoid plummeting to the ground at high speed.
Austin:
"Dear nintendo,
Hi! It's me, austin!"
Nintendo:
"Oh no not again"
Damn.
BAHAHAHAHAHA!
is it possible that his "saddle" is a kind of springboard? would make things easier on both of them and explain the increased hight
You know you‚Äôre not a child anymore when you fully understand all the math that‚Äôs going on in these videos
While I love all this theory crafting, I always start wondering how much this all means when you do "pixel perfect measurements" for distances but then "near instantaneous jumps would mess up the math too much, so I'll use this real life example instead" for the timings, similarly to how it's just assumed that gravity in mario works like it does on earth, but what really should be done it to see what the actual code calculates to then go by the standards set there. I mean I get where it's coming from, but tbh I just think all of that loses a lot of meaning when you see these double standards side by side.
Austin







Your the only one dat paid attention in school
1:50 WTF WAS IN THE RIGHT
1:53 is that Yuri?( ddlc )
reading is better then math no ofence
That‚Äôs what Yoshi gets for committing tax fraud.
way better than matpat
maybe Yoshi doesnt die, since he can achieved 85m/h, he could just have travel back in time or forwards in the game
Anyone else notice the reference to the end of the world at 4:39? Haven't heard that in a looooong time
who else spotted the yuri during 1:50 ?
There is a 0.01% chance of finding this comment
Imagine how buff mario‚Äôs legs must be if he can actually do that with that kind of gravity holding him down
While I agree that Mario is a Jerk, I think this isn't all on his side. With the pixel animation's despite the forces applied to his back, when he is falling before and after the Sacrifices, his speed does not change. You can be pushed past your terminal velocity, but what if Yoshi, Pavlovian trained by being hit in the head, exerted additional force at a conditioned motion that would give Mario the needed velocity for the extra height. Yoshi, good boy that he is, throws himself away to ensure the Plumber (who instantly replaces him at the very next egg) can survive. Such as jumping and throwing your pen into the air.
I feel bad for yoshi
Maths
1:47 Anybody gonna talk about the yuri from doki doki in the right?
You can't cancel mass at 6:16 since one's in a square root and the other isn't. Now make another video :D
Is the cannon height before or after he gets bigger by eating a mushroom?
So that why galaxy has no more fall damage? Didn't they reset space and time because whatever in that game?
Finally, a jump force theory!
Lemme be frank Austin, I like your content, I like what you make. Dorkly on the other hand has earned my ire. After their MTG controversy video, the lack of a certain IMPORTANT thing being mentioned, and then the changing of the video title to obfuscate this "oversight" on their part, I am well and truly done with them, and would recommend anyone reading this to do the same.
Well, Yoshi is going to die anyway in all those shown cases. It doesn't matter if he crashes to death at 50 mph or 200 mph. Yoshi at least saved mario's life. That's what Counts.
Oh god rip Yoshi
did anyone see the doki doki thing on 1:53
The way that m is cancelled in the potential-kinetic energy equation irks me. Also, ms^2 and Newton denoted as n.

Great vid tho!
Favorite part of game theory is Austin.
Love all of your videos, keep it up.
My Kinematics class prepared me for this
#WeAreHereForYouMatPat

Thank you all for everything!
Where did that clip of Mario knocking Luigi's hat off come from?
Mario confirmed dbz character (Anybody
can you finish Kirby please
can you finish Kirby please
Here is ze earth... it is round... it is a pretty sweet earth you might say...
sees Austin's actual face for the first time
(generic thirst comment)
Only the promise of blood can inspire Mario to use his full jump potential.
my fnaf thory: in  the box 'the pices put to garhor' the bite victim  is in there prupel guy said:'mabey things are best forgotten'he's trying to forget
Find the face of swagger souls I dare you there‚Äôs a video with the URL in one of his videos
Yoshi is dead? Good! That punk always beats me in Smash.
1:45 -  1:53 yuri is slowly approaching from the right
I love all of your videos, with the exception of this one. I don't know what it was about this video but it's incredibly boring. I have started watching it 3 times and I can't make it halfway before turning it off. I even tried having it play in the background while I did something else and I still had to switch videos 3 minutes in. I do really enjoy all of your videos but this one is not hitting the mark for me =(
1:50 Yuri lol
Austin GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The rearranging of equation is wrong
I miss the old Austin, i miss the screaming tirades he used to go on :(
That intro reminded me of Bioshock infinite. Why you do this to me ü§£
"May you make a Theory about this  cartoon Network web series called villainous? If yes...that would really make me happy!"
yoshi and mario, two best friends forever!
He, tells me where to go, me and mario!
apples, colored red, their my favorite flavor!
please stop punching my head, please stop punching my head!
I can jump so far!  This one looks real big!
wait where are you going?  HE JUST JUMPED OFF!
Yoshi, left behind, discarded at the goal.
turns out that mario is an  ***hole!

(that was made by animation domination high-def)
in rememberence of yoshi, who lived a wonderful life, and was betrayed by his best friend.
Evaluation: The characters of Mario are literal ancient italian gods.
just be happy that when yoshi is above a bottomless pit he will slow down to terminal velocity.
shouldn't a footstool be a spike in smash then b/c it seems like all the characters jump more or less the same height?
If the gravity of the game is almost 4x Earth's gravity and you have the likes of Mario and Yoshi running and jumping around like it's nothing, then how strong are they? When astronauts come back down to Earth after being in space for an extended amount of time, they loose bone density and are a bit weaker and have to re-adjust to Earth's gravity. If Mario and Yoshi are dealing with 4x Earth's gravity they must be able to withstand more force acted upon them just to be able to move around as freely as they do now so maybe an impact of like 50MPH or more isn't as bad for them? Would Yoshi's saddle made in 4x gravity be able to withstand Mario's jump and save him from breaking his back on takeoff?


A side question, if you take a goomba out of the game with 4x Earth's gravity, and put it in our world, would we be able to stomp it like Mario?
Hearing 'Tamriel' and being reminded of the TES lore videos.
6:16 actually, the mass wouldn‚Äôt cancel out.  m ‚â† ‚àöm
I'm the only one bothered that he didn't talked that Yoshi's fall speed is reset when Mario Jumps off?
M A T H
Conjecture: Yoshi has springy properties, which is why Mario can't jump at that height normally (he can't move his legs that fast, but he can ride the spring)
You have one wrong caculation, or perhap presentation my friend. How can m cancle out square m. You should have presented it in a previous scence, which is mgh=5mv^2. Just a quick note for you:v
Rip yoshi
1:53 yuri is to the right.
Not seconds per second.  Square seconds.  Acceleration isn't meters per (second per second), it's (meters per second) per second.  m/s * 1/s = m/s^2, meters per square second.
HEY AUSTIN! I have a request for a video topic! You should do a video explaining the biology and physics of what happens to Madeline from Celeste in the fall from chapter 6. It‚Äôs terrifying honestly, and I am REALLY curious of the pacifics of how Dino pulp Madeline is after this.
1:53 YURI?
What if some of the force that pushes Mario up is from yoshi. For example, he forces Mario off his back using his back. Wouldn‚Äôt this mean Mario will not have as devastating of a jump force, but yoshi‚Äôs back will still be broken due to the same force being applied to his back.
What is Rayman
0:26 Bamboozle




Hah it‚Äôs ok I got mirage at level 63 and the only thing I regret is not getting him at level 23. Definitely my favourite legend
Nobody:
Austin: hI iTs mE AuStiN
9:20 I actually used something similar equations to discredit flat earth theory.  

The short version is it doesn't take as long as you'd think to accelerate from negative c to positive c.  Because that's the speed limit of the universe, and that span is surprisingly short, the earth cannot be flat because we're not experiencing relativistic effects or floating.  Which we would be when we hit the universe's speed limit.
Sweet, Yuri shows up at 1:45
Oh... Austin heh ? 
Leaves the video
YES another Austin vid
WHO CAUGHT YURI IN THIS VIDEO?
Have you very did a video of the Broodal
5:06 the top# made my day
I lost him at 6:25
Im litteraly crying
You do understand that Mario just violated your own law gravity. For not only can he jump all of another object without losing any momentum but can jump higher did he was when he's on the ground and you said it was possible? I know I'm not a smart cookie but even I know that's impossible and you don't show any evidence on person in real life doing this no wonder flat Earth is a getting momentum because Mario just pulled a thug life by saying I am "F*** the law of gravity".
Ok I am a little confused with the math, and maybe I'm doing it wrong. At 6:19 the equation is mv=sqrt(2ghm) and he says that dividing m on both sides would be v=sqrt(2gh). Isn't that wrong? Shouldn't it be v=sqrt(2ghm)/m?
Where is Matt patt
6:14 How does mass cancel out if it's in square-root on one side?

MatPat said there were some theories he can't publish due to them not being 10+ minutes long.
Could there be a 20 minute video with multiple theories?

So do I

This doesn't rhyme but it's honest
First!!!! Well I‚Äôm not... but..... 0 views = 513 likes. MAKES TOTAL SENSE
6:14 this equation is false
Warning! The following comment mentions Undertale, if that offends you then skip it.

A few days ago a game known as escaped chasm was released. It was made by Temmie Chang (one of Undertales developers) and had its music composed by Toby Fox. Very few people in the fandom have noticed it yet and I figured this channel was the best place to let people know about it.
I'm sorry, Yoshi.

FFS IT AUSTIN NOOOOOO
I just watched the song lol
:151 thank me later 151
can we all talk about the fact that Yuri is in the right of the screen! 1:47
Who else saw Yuri on the right side of the screen when he was in the dark near the beginning
man... mario is a jerk to yoshi, from the sacrifice, to the punch, im starting to go with luigi in smash bros.
Did you just cancel the mass when one of the side was the sqrt of the mass?
I want mattpatt
STOP AUSTIN WHERES MATPAT
Turtles are reptiles ERRREEEEEEEE
Ummm well mario's evil huh






DOES'NT THAT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD DESTROY HIM!!!!! IM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THIS.
Dear viewers of this comment, 

I literally screamed:
"HI! It's me! AUSTIN!!!"
And got a little sad when he didn't scream so much in this theory...

Sincerely, Selma
After your break can you do:
Is uboa (from yume nikki)
And imscared white face 
Is related to gaster? That is me.
Yayy Austin! I love the episodes with him on GT. Wouldn't it be fun if MatPat and Austin did a theory together? Like, both are calmly explaining formulas and such in the beginning but by the end they're both freaking out due to the absolute ridiculousness of the things they calculated.

Just an idea.
Yoshi : "Mario Stop this is Murderrr I'll get you next timeeeeee!!! Falls into lava
I like the episodic intro to the show
But Albert Einstein proved Isaac Newton wrong I think
I'm showing this to my science teacher on Monday(yep when I'm typing this it's Friday)
wait, hold on, during the slo-mo pixel jump scene at 13:08 it shows the yoshi jump to be just like if it was on the ground, with yoshi falling down like if it reached his jump peak
6:17 I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works
Tell Matpat to do some more Fortnite lore!!! It's been a while!
4:08 I think those pills on the shelf are for Austins insanity.

Hey it's me... 




AUSTIIINNNNNNNNN!
‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you jumping like this all the time‚Äù 






Has flashbacks to mario RPG
Random person: "Hey Mario, have you ever seen a dinosaur skeleton?" Mario: "..."
Oh my goodness, this series is sooo much better at 2x speed.
What if matpat's entire channel is one massive theory that WE are supposed to solve? I wouldn't be surprised.
So people in this show write on the walls???
I don‚Äôt know you tell me.
Since Yoshi is fine after these jumps what is he made of?
Despite looking like plain old leather shoes, Yoshi is actually wearing an early version of Aperature Sciences Long-Fall Boots - before someone, for whatever reason, decided that additional protection from fire and sharp objects were unnecessary, and started development over. 
 
Dumping the existing manufactured units of the model onto an island inhabited by dinosaurs, Aperature unknowingly kick-started the social evolution of Yoshi sentience that would eventually result in the abuse and murder of countless units of their species. 
 
IF THEY KNEW THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THEY HAD WROUGHT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD
I SAW YURI
I guess he's adapted to being slamed to the ground, or it's another universe he's in, different universe different physics, our phisics and there phisics are different
14:28 remember the gravity is increased in Mario
can you cancel through a square root?
13:59 I like the F1 reference
I'm Starting To Think The Dislikes are People Who Don't Believe in gravity.  üòí
Mario must really hate Yoshi... look how much stronger he's able to push if it's to hurt the poor lizard.
I bet everyone is looking at Mario in a different way
pewdiepie = like


T series = comment
Its finaly noticed that yoshi did tax evation cus he needed to pay hospital bills
Austin's lowkey very annoying
please never use the music you used in the intro ever again
poor Luigi.. Poor Yoshi..
I saw Yuri in the background too!
I feel like I can debunk this by giving Yoshi physics on the springboard in SMW
It would have been cool if mario could ride on top of a koopa for a certain period of time before it kicks you off.     So you could sacrifice an enemy instead of best friend yoshi
I was really waiting for a  last minute.. PS
The problem with your theory is that you are applying or laws from our universe on Mario. Since we dont see Mario actually jump that high and it's actually possible for you to continue to use Yoshi after jumping off his back and we clearly see Yoshi being okay. So either your Newtonian physics don't apply or Yoshi skeletal structure is much more powerful than you give him credit for.
4:39 that's a pretty old reference. hokay. so. here is ze earth.
Austin where is the old music??
That‚Äôs not how spring force works though yes he is going higher but that doesn‚Äôt mean he is lighter because then the spring would not compress as much a when Mario jumps on it
Wait, who is this guy?
Every time I watch a video of you my 5 year old brother comes running to grab a chair to it! He loves your videos!

ms2 is not the same thing as m/s2 -_-
Mario didnt kill yoshi, you did
why can't Austin start up and post videos on his own channel.
Are you assuming that Yoshi's bone is the same as human bones? 
What if they are made of super light fiber or something?
That moment when Link jumped on Mario's meant so much to me... if I was Link, after I had landed, I would've look him in the eyes and said, "See how that feels? That was for the green dragon you Mitch!"
Yoshi will get his revenge...


Soon...
Wouldn‚Äôt including air resistance make it worse?

It can in the new super mario series with the music rythm

"What I have on my 'Ruin Your Childhood' agenda is..."
These videos are so incredibly well made, Austin, your voice is so rhymic that people can feel where the next syllable is going to lie like it's music, I could zone out and listen to one of these, not pay attention to what's going on, and still be taken on an emotional roller coaster.
Is Yoshi Luigi‚Äôs reincarnation
6:11 Uhhh how does exactly mass cancel out in that equation? I'm pretty sure it'd have to be mv=sqrt(2ghm^2) for it to cancel out????
I love how the Theorists have basically made a table of constants regarding information is some settings; like for mario they now have his weight, height, and from there they can calculate the constants of other characters
music?
10:56
This is why we should support the freedom fighters
how heavy is 1 kg cus i use pounds
What happened to MatPat
YOSHI
At 12:24 you're making an error: If Yoshi jumps 16% higher than Mario, his mass has to be 100/116 of Mario's. That's not exactly 16% less.
I paid attention up until the first time you said Yoshi
how dare you referance that fckn  awful theory

Where is MatPat
Hi


hi austin
You really shouldn't apply science to video games
4:40 damn, that is a sweet earth
You forgot that fall damage isn't a thing in these games. He dies from pits because the velocity of air while he's falling tears him apart 'cause he's moving so fast as the pits are bottomless, and the worst these falls actually ever do is stun characters for a few seconds
0:36 amphibian murderer?
6:21

Did... did he really... did he just really cancel out mass when on one side it's not squared but on the other one it is?
Don't tell Austin but he looks like a math teacher
1:49 anyone notice that on the right?
1:53 is that an anime character on the side or something?
Poor Yoshi.
0:36
Cut to Over the Hedge as Vern says ‚ÄúReptile‚Äù
Please do a theory on Code Lyoko
The lore of the show is very interesting...
Mario jumps 3.69 meters. Everytime I jump in Mario this will be in my head.
6:17 Hang on! Am I stupid or can you actually cut it like that, cause one mass is under root...

P.S. I am Ukrainian so I don‚Äôt know any of the terminology in English
Quick question. Could you give the songs used in the video in the descriptions? Thanks
01:54. Just Monika :D
MATH (dun dun dun dun!)
Can you do a theory about Escaped Chasm
Let me point out that yoshi has been smiling the hwole video
long time no see!
1:30 what‚Äôs in the right hand corner?
Perhaps Yoshis bodies have some sort of negative mass particles that can add even more force to Mario's jump and reduce the relative force when the Yoshi hits the ground. 

It may also help to explain how they can live through falling into a bottomless abyss.
WHERE IS THE ‚Ä¶ RICHEST V
IDIO
Theory neglects Yoshi's flutter kick and why Yoshi can jump higher than Mario. Theory is BAD.
WHERE'S THE REST OF THE WHO'S RICHEST SERIES?
poor yoshi
why is monike is thare?
1:50 did anyone else see Yuri on the right side?
Mario is still god
Did anyone else see yuri?
Sometimes I wonder if these games are actually supposed to have a low gravity with the falling speed being a concession to gameplay. doesn't make much sense otherwise.
5:04 is no one gonna talk about this very specific number???
mario:
hero on the outside
evil psychopath on the inside
In the next Mario game he surely will come to get Austin and MatPat
Anyone else thinks that that clip of mario slapping luigi's hat is what matpat had in mind when he said he had a mario moment that can top mario laughing at his brother while grinding his shoe 
Or is that just me
WE WANT OLD AUSTIN! COMPLETE WITH LOUD SCREAMING AND LITTERED WITH CURSE WORDS!
You know even though killing yoshi is bad but I'm starting to feel good about this episode
I still play this game on a flash website. AND I DONT EVEN DO THAT. I JUST DIE.
That pen example was real bad.
Considering Mario and Yoshi live in an environment with high gravity, they probably have super strength and theirs bodies are adapted to jumping and receiving those impacts.
I make errors like the one you made all the time in my calculations. Every time I do things I will always go though with sources on the labels of the numbers to ensure I have it right
If my math is correct, that would mean Yoshi weighs roughly 164 pounds.
What about the richest gaming by character
you just can't stop with the mario math, what's the next step? "How hard does Mario have to kick a shell to make it go at the speed it's going in the game" ? no matter what it is I'm sure it's gonna be hillarious and interesting at the same time, just like this video right here.
Turns out that mario is an as hole
@everyone
Just me but I'd really, REALLY prefer matpat to be doing these kind of videos expecially on these mario related videos which he does very well. This guy as soon as I heard his voice. I got turned off. I just find this guy annoyingü§∑. But that's just my personal take. I just find this guy too exagerated in his voice.
Wait where is matpat
WHAT IS THAT SONG
1:53 oh hey, it's... oh HELL NO
Now Austin is Yuugo, if only Austin had met a girl with orange hair that would save him from despair because she was abducted...


If only....
NB: Turtles are reptiles and not amphibians.  Edit:  That was just a nit, but overall I really enjoyed the video.  Keep up the good work here.
1:51 

YYYYYUUUUUURRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Everything you've said in this vidio was better then how my teacher described the 3 laws
Didnt you determine before that the gravity in mario is more dense so wouldn't it be faster in universe
Why is no one QUESTIONING
wouldn't Mario's feet break as well?
Mario! Don't jump!... Oh no, he can't hear us, he has airpods in!
you skipped 2 seasons
What song is it at 4:36?
Nice reference to the "Hokay, herez the earth"
oh, and dont forget he smashes bricks amde out of his toad friends. the MOST evil though? ehhhhhhh -_- kirby..?
Honestly Austin you might need some help.
Wow he didn't even curse well done Austin
well, mario doesn't skip leg day i guess
Yuri maybe psychotic but she's still my bei. When she's not being corrupt by the lovely Monika! Whom I also love. I don't like the last two.... who shall not be named! Also I forgot their names.....
my brain hurts
Where's matpat!?
weres mat pat
m cancels out root m?
Austin: Math, Velocity, Newton's laws, etc.
Yoshi: Flutter kick
But isn't Yoshi falling with max speed (terminal velocity) already so that Mario can't accelerate him any further with his jump? Or can he?
Mushrooms can jump without legs.

New super mario bros.
Austin be a gay boi!!! Imma proud! (IMMA BI BUDDY)
When Mario gives yoshi the double bird I always die laughing
leg day must be every day for mario
There is a weird squiggly line on the left side between 5 and 6 minutes in that made me think my monitor was broken. Thanks game theory!
Austin, you are adorable
4:15 who else was in agony watching him attempt collecting that SC?
IT'S AUSTIN!!!!
obligatory comment here nothin special move on
listening to this will make me extremely smart i will use my new smartness to improve the world
Don't you have a kid my guy?
1:50 Don't think I did not see that girl creeping in on the spotlight...
Austin is sexy
Wth youre not matpat ;P
Hey Austin, what do ya think about that kh3 ending? Also, my and my dad have a theory that Aqua is Sora's mom. Your input?
Was that an anime girl in the room
DO THE DOG POKEMON WITH MATPAT PLZ
Hello Mat id just like to say I discovered a thing.... in this this game called Mystic Messenger it a free game to playin a mobile phone the way you play is, you have to answer chat rooms at a certain time and wether or not you answer the chat rooms will effect the story and it‚Äôs also you‚Äôre answers will effect it to (kinda like Doki Doki), But  what I discovered that the mpc 707 is kinda braiding the 3rd wall but in a very creepy way and like when he does it looks like this 
(Just pretend he sed this) justknowingwealldontexsistisweird 
And this character Zen has sidekick dreams witch in his rout he had a dream about another character ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô had came and kidnapped MC (the name that the fanbase calls the only playable character) the is a theory about 707 all ready but I‚Äôd like to have it be more popular and what better way than to tell you so idk if you take requests but if you do here‚Äôs one so just ask A girl and a game if it‚Äôs ok to make it more popular and to just credit her plz and thank you

                    -with lots of love Sayoriüíñ (and god bless you and you‚Äôre team friends and familyüôèüèªüíñüíñ

The theory I got this off of (...and that want you to make more popular)

I found Yuri
1:50
"hokay so.. here's the earth" I see you, Austin
6:17 wait how does the "m" cancel out?
So that's the origin of dry bones, it's all the previous versions of yoshi that DIED!
Mario can normal jump do high that he can drop kick the tallest man
Always fascinated by the maths behind these kind of things. So it seems that Mario could defeat Bowser by jumping off of his back. No need to throw fireballs/hit him with a ton of shells, or cut the bridge out from under him.
Mat pat was right about switch VR can‚Äôt wait for breath of the wild VR
Yay, more Austin!
5:10 Is the fall time based on a fall with the jump button held or released? It matters.
6:15 You cancelled the mass on the left of the equation with the square root of the mass on the right. That's a potentially significant difference.
Yuri's Creepin
God damn screaming sonovabitch.
I caught that " ho'kay so heresy the earth (roooooooooouuuund) end of ze world joke there Austin I caught it. You had to make the 90s reference
So MatPat was right all along, Mario is a sociopath.
I don't understand
Please say I'm not the only one
YURI
Where‚Äôs gaming‚Äôs richest part 2?
Turns out it wasn't a meteorite that killed all of the dinosaurs it was Mario jumping off all of them into the ground
What the........
Can I just say that Hourigan is my last name... that‚Äôs pretty cool to me
who saw yuri owo
Oooo a new game theory
"Hi it's Austin"
...
Austin could you please also add in Kilometers per hour, while you also mention the mph?  Love the video, keep up the good work!
Yoshi come break my back instead so I can see how you feel please :D
The most satisfying thing is that I already knew the basics thanks to school. I feel so intelligent!
We need more outros with Austin dancing, please (?
A good old Mario theory, Austin :c
Yuri wot u doin stalking austin go home and re evaluate ur decisions and go after natsuki
14:33 for those whom don‚Äôt find physics fun
wait, mass cancels out? not if mass is under the square root symbol on one side of the equation
I gave a like for the dancing Austin
12:47 Why is his final velocity lower than his starting velocity (of 48 m/s)?
Yuri? 1:51
Hey Austin, i love your videos but please, use also the metric system
I got a theory. So, Mario's weight of 89 kg is on that value, cause the higher gravity makes him heavier. As a conclusion, in our world he would weigh less and in the mushroom kingdom his bones and muscles must be built differently to counteract higher gravity. His body is actually quite strong,  so forces can cause less damage to him. To have a comparison to our world, wouldn't it make sense to calculate all the forces and what they would do with mario's weight and gravity to those of our world?
6:16 probably mass can't be cancel out because one is in the square root and the other is not
Some real weird math at 6:12. The result is correct, but the steps inbetween are pretty darn wrong
This guy doesnt know how to do math... cancel out the mass before you take the square root, use the time between when you press the jump button and when Mario leaves the ground for (delta t).
anyone else think Austin lookin finna nice? he lookin finna good man. no homo vro .
Who‚Äôs that creeping on Austin in the right hand side?
3:11 how the hell do you think rockets work, Austin? A rocket is literally a cylinder ejecting relatively small amounts of matter that were previously moving with it at really high velocities in the opposite direction in order to propel the cylinder upwards
10:05 Doctor: "Calculating the mass of something is easy, it ain't rocket science"
Austin: has Super Mario Sunshine flashbacks

14:07 Also Austin: "The bricks are made of concrete"
 OVER NINE THOUSAAAND!!
For Future episodes could you convert your Final Numbers (should they be in m/s) into km/h it's a lot more common used than m/s (in like Germany at least)
Hi. It's me. AUSTIN!
Welcome new theorists!
YEEEESSSS!!!!!!!!!! Austin your Amazing!!!!!!!!!
In my cience class we are studying newton laws
Dashiegames needs to see this lmao
ultra instinct mario
There was a version of this in mythbusters - a bridge is collapsing can you jump to safety. They discovered as soon as the bridge started falling there was nothing to push against cause you were falling. You just changed how fast you were falling for a moment.
Why is Yuri in your room?
This also makes you wonder about the kinds of things Mario is capable with standing, given the change in momentum when jumping off of Yoshi near the ground.
I missed Austin.
I love Vivaldi four seasons winter  at 11:40
There is an anime girl at 1:52 on the right
I have a good game for you to tear apart, "Anthem." There is a lot of science-y stuff in it. Tip: you can put your team on Private when doing a contract or mission, but Freeplay and Strongholds are always Public. "Private" means that your current squad will not be put into match-making, meaning that you can be by yourself and you can invite people to join you. Heads Up: it can take a while to load but you don't go through a lot of instances like in Destiny. The only instances that are small are the caves and whatnot.
I can‚Äôt stand Austin
At last i can understand some thing i learned acceleration this year
FMA
mat pat is better
Where is Mr. Pat
Errr, you are not allowed to cancel mass out of a root, are you? 

2x3=(2x18)^-1

Cancel the 2 out and you got
3=18^-1 which is wrong
Wait a minute i just realized...



Im a couple centimeters taller than Mario :0
1:53 Ah, yes. Seconds per second. My favourite measurement.
undertale chara/sans damage force
Hey Matt have you ever played middle earth shadow of war I would recommend it if you‚Äôre in the Lord of the rings but I got a test for you in shadow of war you can take and defend fortresses which defenses and assault weapons are the best
Only me who saw Yuri?ü§îü§îü§î
Yoshi's are a tool to be used then discarded
When Yoshi Falls He Becomes A Egg While Falling In A Void Then He Teleports To The Next Nest
If mario jumped that high, then his legs would end up well
I mean if the gravity is however high the other measurement was it makes sense why captain toad cant jump
YURI!? 1:45
Yoshi committed tax fraud
Literally learning this in physics
So glad physics uses metric units! I would not watch these videos if you were using Imperial units..
Is Mario immortal?
Could Mario actually be a vampire?
Dude, Mario is a terrorist, lol gahdamn! Poor Yoshi!
I‚Äôm a pretty smart dude and I‚Äôve learned a lot about weather from game theory and then My friend asked me what would happen if the temperature around the world was 115 degrees Fahrenheit and it when down to the temperature of the freaking ice age and seconds 
Then I proceeded to have a minor mental breakdown and then I went on ranting about how bad things because that freaking energy has to go somewhere I hope that the earths temperature changed evenly cause if not we got wind lots of wind fast wind the planet it‚Äôs self is doomed and 
I then started screaming like Austin
If Mario jumps higher while riding Yoshi, could that imply Yoshi's back (shell) might act like a spring board? Who's to say the shell is rigid? Maybe it's bouncy and soft. Would make riding him easier and indeed Yoshis seem to have evolved to be ridden.

Would this change any of the data?
Out of anything to obsess over the Yoshi sacrifice is a pretty good one
Thats only about 4 years. Not that long
U can only push onto something as hard as it can resist the push... thx mark rober


Which made me think that Mario will just spike yoshi, and not gain any height
Skip the intro 
Me: heard voice Who is this ? literally 1 sec later Oh it‚Äôs Austin
I swear the  background music is from liar liar
THE SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!
This video has 666 thousand views, now expose ProtoMario so we can get him the help he deserves.
You can't cancel  mass and square root of mass at 6:18 it doesn't work like that üòî
So is bowser trying to save the princess from this evil Italian plumber?
1:50 wait a second what is that in the right?
Yaaay Insert Dancing Austin
666k views üò≥
it has 666k view
God damn it, I needed this like two days ago...
You know that battle bus video you did well the battle bus balloon runs on blu glo like that in save the world so Idk how powerful that crap is but it might work to heat that ballon and also the balloon cover might not be made of nylon
6:25 were you allowed to cancel the mass when it was under a root though?
What if the higher jump is due to an ejection seat in the saddle.
Austin, at 6:18, you cancelled mass out, but one side was m and the other side was sqrt(m). That doesn't cancel out. You reduced the formula wrong. m should cancel out at 6:13 such that 2gh=v^2 and v=sqrt(2gh). Same outcome, but you show it wrong for a second.
i didnt liked un :P
Mario is a God
Austin has good music
Does this mean the best way to KO Yoshi mains is by footstooling them?
Some small problems with the spring.  1,  because of how springs work, they Express more power into heavier items not lighter ones... because the heavier the object the more it compresses the spring creating more energy. 

2, their body designs also would have  an affect as yoshi is a beast of burden capable of carrying multiple people.  It would be like comparing a rabbit and  a rat, although they weigh about the same the rabbits legs have much more jump force and  are capable of exerting more force aswell as taking more force.   Jump man Mario might be know for his jumps but to a yoshi every day is leg day.
I never thought I would hear a Group X reference again in my life. Bless you, crazy science man.
1:51, Oh no! AnttheZombieSlayers girlfriend Yuri is here. XD
1:43 Yuri creepin' in from the side, ready to stab Austin.
Ever heard of N+? If so figure out just how real it realy is
Also, Mario isn't a normal human.
He can breathe in space, people.
6:14 in this formula one m is under square root and the other isn't you cant just remove them. Its just a typo cause m shouldnt be under root in the first place. Its just important for people not to think you can remove stuff without proper principles

sorry for my english
I understand the physics because I have studied it but you explained it pretty badly for others who haven't
You should go with the science of the ground pound
Well, those saddles aren't weak, my friend.
Play super Mario galaxy 2 and you'll know yoshi doesn't die. He teleports.
Rip Yoshi. You deserved better.
I dont understand the language he is speakin
LMAO RIP
I don't think that the pen is pushing you down in your jumping example, the pen isn't providing its own thrust. If you had a compressed spring in your hand and then released it during the jump then it would be a different matter
Cool video. I would like to know how far Mario has traveled throughout all his play throughs and if he has circled the earth with his distance. Also technically Mario has never sent a Yoshi hurdling to his death. Hes is being controlled by the player and the player chooses weather to sacrifice Yoshi or not. Mario has no choice in the matter.
Perhaps Yoshi is very mushy? That's why he can eat all those things and it doesn't hurt him. He may also be pushing back on Mario, sending him higher. (also, he opens his mouth when Mario jumps off and on him. I assume that hurts)
And who said science was boring
Oi! .... stop that dancin' at the end, mate.
2:21 Wait. He‚Äôs talking to himself by TELLING himself to not repeat the same joke. But... he must‚Äôve gone back in time to tell him that. So can you imagine the time paradoxes that could happen?! You can‚Äôt interact with yourself in an already existing timeline! You know what? I‚Äôm not gonna question it. Let your universe die in an instant, Austin.
12:53 THATS 156 KM/PH üò•üò±üò±üò≠üò≠ rip yoshi
13:33 180 KM/PH!!!!!! WHY MARIO!!!WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KILL EVERYTHINGüò≠üò≠üò≠ even the most inocent of all
Did at 6:19 you ser mass cancels out and removed (m) from the left and (‚àöm) from the right? 
Maybi i just have a mistake.
A McLaren f1 reference... Where my 90's kids at??
i love how i got a yoshis crafted world ad right before a video that explains about how brutaly mario is going to kill him
I like Vivaldi‚Äôs Winter in the background at the end
This reminds me of mortal combat, but intellectual.
can you calculate the power of marios air spin
Dear Austin,
Hey, it's me, Austin!
No matter what? Challenge accepted.
1 question to put a hole in your science:
Did you take into account the fact that living in a stronger gravity would make Yoshi significantly stronger? 
Hence why he can also survive all those punches to the head and enemy attacks.
Sincerely, Austin
1:50 who else noticed yuri?
i am scared 
i have to learn all this math
This video has taught me more in 15 minutes than my science teacher could in 6 months
I just want to play Minecraft
No one notice the Monica in the back of the swinging light scene with blood on the walls. She gets closer every time it swings and she is on the right
Explaining Game theory in a weird way:

A puzzle, that grows all the time. The complete picture was created by a few people, but those people won‚Äòt see what the picture will actually look like. 

The pieces are found by thinking about the part of the puzzle that is needed at the moment. AND THE BEST PART: The pieces can be put at another place, saying that it‚Äòs needed there. 

The complete picture... is Game Theory. The second picture is Film Theory. 



And this is the weirdest way of explaining this channel. Idk... my brain explains things to me, but doesn‚Äòt tell me to say the context out loud... since it‚Äòs probably longer than my lifetime.
If you notice that after that jump near the floor yoshi slows down before he hits the floor... so yoshi must have anti gravity powers which allows him to survive the force and maybe accelerate mario... just a thought.
wheres matpat
So out of curiosity, what if yoshi is bucking Mario off with a command (for example: Mario hits yoshi to cause him to eat things). If Mario was expecting the buck and jumped from yoshi's back at the top of the buck, wouldn't this explain the difference in jump heights from standing and from yoshi's back?
Bad mario
Hmm. I recognize Antonio Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the background. (between 3:00 and 3:16).
1:44 Did anyone else see Yuri sneaking in, in the corner?
Person: What is the most evil video game character ever?
Game theory: Mario from Super Mario.
Nintendo: What mushrooms have you been eating lately?!
Maybe Yoshi starts flying exactly when Mario jumps, making Mario go faster
How high does Yoshi jump?
It bugs me really hard that the visuals are not consistent in terms of units: writing ms¬≤ instead of m/s¬≤ or ms (7:12).
#protectheyoshi
Mario doesn't jump like that all the time because yoshi throws him when he jumps off, imparting muscular energy into the equation.  Just like when you throw the pen.  Which can't jump on it's own.  Also, yoshi has a wierd terminal velocity for his shape.  He can even arrest his float a bit in mid air by wiggling his arms and legs in some games and he really shouldn't have the flight characteristics for that.  So..maybe that is why yoshi isn't splattered on the ground?  He might also be doing parkor between frames and changing his impact.
The title in the thumbnail just sounds like a very aggressive way of trying to prevent a suicide
Austin is part of treeciciacl
You back yaaaaaaa
When u finish richest video game character
its yoshi sacrifice
Ok, if you can reach terminal velocity by falling like 2-3 meters, air resistance is pretty damn high in this setting, which means Mario would not only have to jump against a gravitational force 23x higher than Earth's, but he'd leave the ground at speeds way above terminal velocity, resulting in forces that are just stupidly enormous.

No wonder he can swing an iron hammer not significantly smaller than himself about as fast as I can swing my arms up and down without holding anything.
The force of a mushroom being on the ground does not cancel out with that exerted by the ground on the mushroom (they are applied on different objects). The force applied by the ground on the mushroom is canceled out by the mushroom's weight. That is what gives a bet force of 0N being applied on the mushroom.

And BTW the animation for "the masses cancel out" is also wrong
if someone gave austin some shuger it would be the shortest video ever :)
How many of there are you
1:53 Is that a doki doki theory coming up from the right?
Mario be like ‚Äú I am going into a sewer pipe and end up somewhere else not in the sewers ‚Äú 
Mario fans be like ‚Äú I want to go to Russia. Oooooo there is a sewer pipe if I go down it I will end up in Russia ‚Äú
Mom: honey are you sure you want to do that? 
Kid: yeah mom I saw Mario do it and he went somewhere else so why can‚Äôt I do it?
* jumps in sewer * 
* drowns in sewer water because he was an idiot and thought he was Mario but he was not, *
skip
Did you know that Austin is a soyboy?
I'm probably gonna get a ton of hate but I just wanted to point out a small error. Don't worry it's not the math but the units.  Meter  per second should be written like this (m/s) and not meter second (ms) because that is something else. The units is written incorrectly for only a small part of the video so please don't scream at me when you see the units written correctly for the rest of the video. I just wanted to get that information out there.
when you have to have a m/s to km/h converter open to understand how fast its actually going. i have zero clue what mph actually is
Wasnt 1 Newton 100 gramms times 9.81?
1:46 YURI ON THE RIGHT
Ironic that he talked about error of seconds but doesn't notice that all the other errors in the units...like acceleration is m/s^2 not ms^2 and othersüòÇ upto that point of time..
Anyone else bothered by how the math for initial velocity was misshown? The end formula was correct but the visual representation was incorrect. You can't divide a variable out of a root.
when you just finished 8th grade so you know what hes talking about
Was this inspired by the shaggy episode ü§î
Austin go to Super Smash Bros Ultimate and footstool a character with Mario, you'll be amazed at how long Mario will jump off the character.
Anyone got the math on yoshis weight from the springboard? In the back of my head since it‚Äôs a spring the mass wouldn‚Äôt be a linear factor like that.
6:14 presentation error. It should be root m on the left side of the equation
Yo wtf is monika doing in the background on the right 1:52
Did you guys see yuri?
I SEE YOU YURI, DONT TRY TO HIDE FROM ME!
Where is mat
See this is why I have never EVER done that to poor Yoshi! I am a good Mario. I have never once let go of him like that
So what you‚Äôre saying is that mcskillet just wanted to see what it was like to be Yoshi.
Would it not be significantly easier to just use conservation of momentum? You already calculate m and v of Mario and Yoshi, and this way, you don't have to make assumptions based on jump times and such.
Hey here‚Äôs an idea for a video! How much energy would you have to use to blow a Ptooie up in the air like Piranha Plant???? I don‚Äôt know why but I gotta know the answer to this.
I never watch Austin's theory videos because he's so annoying. his intro proves my point
i wonder how the pointy Austin kid (2:12) will look like with current Austin's face
I already hated the Yoshi Sacrifice, but this makes me hate it c-fold (with C being the speed of light)
but what if instead of Mario doing all the work, Yoshi himself helped push? like Yoshi and Mario both exerted energy to launch from each other?
Why did I see Shoddycast's intro for his Elder Scrolls Lore videos?
1:54 Hi Yuri B-) (+_+)
Please make a legend of Zelda video
4:34 The music sounds so mush like traditional purtorican music. XD
6:14 isn't correct, but I'm gonna let it slide because the next formula is correct
Yay! Austin!
Anyone else noticed Yuri in the corner at 1:47
How much force does water Kirby need to hover in the air? Do a theory on this PLEASE.
Yo Mat do a theory if Dumbo can actually fly
who knew the extinction of the dinosaurs is mario sending yoshi flying to earth surface that yoshi become a astroid
What's crazy is Mario jumps 3.69 METERS into the air. Just looking at it you would think the gravity is lower, but after the calculations the gravity is 4X earths! Plus the record high jump is 2.45 meters, and that is with a running start and laying flat to get max height. The record vertical leap, like mario does in the video is 1.65 meters, more than half the distance. So how strong is Mario really if he can jump that high in 4x gravity?
What's his channel again?
6:10 this rearranging is wrong, and the mass doesn't cancel out like you said it did in the video.
√µ_o
how many g's does mario create when he jumps off of yoshi's back? does he create enough to start creating irreparable  damage to his body every time it happens? I WANT TO KNOW! if he does hit a high enough g force to kill gain instant karma for the back breaking force he exerts on yoshi's back i demand to know!
Wouldn't gravity be weaker in the Mario world?
Turtles are reptiles.
At 6:15 the mass on the left hand side of the equation needs to be in a square root for it to be cancelled out. I assume that's a typo
I like the video :)
But I do want to mention that it bugs me really hard that the 5 and S om the chalkboard are the same.
Keep up th good video‚Äôs tho, I enjoy learning this way.
Sincerely~ Mathinus
At first I though this episode was gonna be about how deadly is Marios jump xD
You and Matt pat need to have a dance off lol ya‚Äôll are super white lol...... in the best way possible lol nice job Austin on this video loved every second lol
wait yuri?  so you we're here in that hole? WELP, BEST GIRL IS BACK
RIP 1 like one yoshi is saved
This is maths only use
6:18 hold up the mass can‚Äôt cancel out because the mass on the right is being rooted, BAD AUSTIN
Don‚Äôt worry you didn‚Äôt kill my childhood.




You killed the fun of murdering green dinosaurs
Maybe those Meteor Smashes were right?
1:53 sup yuri how have you been
POK√âMON GO AWAY
MARIO RUN AWAY
wait why is my youtube blue?
Game theory Is so confusing because i like Matt better but he stopped using the same format so i prefer these
No one hurts MY Yoshiboy
It would take much longer than 149 million years to reach near light speed with a constant force of 2 Newtons because of relativity.  The time dilation in a rest frame would make it nearly and infinite amount of time before you even reach 0.9c
Amphibian murderer since when are turtles and dinosaurs amphibians? Reptiles man reptiles
Who thinks that MatPat should do a video on the Mario hack ‚ÄòThe?
Amphibian murderer extraordinaire?  But Turtles are reptiles not amphibians
Talk a about spc
Sure. But you neglect that Yoshi can run and jump while carrying Mario on  his back. Which means he 's very durable. So can he survive a downward thrust to the ground considering this?
That helped me for my physics exam
"H'OK, So...Here's the Earth."
Damn Austin, that's a DEEP CUT reference!
I knew middle school science pays off
Who just watches this
Has no idea on what is happening






‚ÄúClaps‚Äù
Now apply this to legolas in the Hobbit
I got a Yoshi crafted world as lol
Well hi yuri. Nice to see you again
1:53 yuriiiiiiii!!!
A quick google of "how to write meters per second" show everything but ms. ms = milliseconds. @6:31
6:20 whoa that's some new math over here! How had you canceled mass under square root and out of it? Does it mean that Mario Wrold world doesn't have mass?!
Sooooo If I had and infinite number of pens could I jump, and then start throwing them down one at a time like a madman and essentially hover because I'm constantly applying a downward force on an object constantly applying an upward force to me?
It‚Äôs easy to mess up units when you write m/s as ms. Please write your math correctly lol
1:54 wack
Austin for president
My name is Austin as well
I‚Äôm pretty sure he changed his channel name
looks like you have a stalker at 1:50
I know this has no connection to this video, but my son asked me a very important question today. In Pok√©mon, Ash never has any of the Pok√©mon from other series except Pikachu, and even though they have been through everything together it‚Äôs like they are totally mindless to all the other adventure. My son said, after I showed him the first movie, is it possible that Ash was cloned along with the other Pok√©mon? That‚Äôs why he never looks old, and he always starts out different. I didn‚Äôt know what to say to him üòÇ
Hey I used to play super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 back in 2010 and I used this trick a little bit
What the heck, Mario?!
Wait. "Okay. So. Here's the Earth."
Did you just reference that extremely old flash animation, Austin? "Fire ze missiles"? Whatever it was called?
"hokay, so, here's the earth"
DID YOU REALLY MAKE THAT REFERENCE
Mario seems to abuse his pets a lot...




also yuri is behind u
i heard you like math how'bout number of gun in borderlands effect economy
1:51 Oh my god Austin watch out yuri is sneaking up on you OH MY GOD HE CANT HEAR US HE HAS AIRPODS IN OH MY GOD!
Was that Yuri in the background..?
All loopholes explained.
Mario jumps higher when on yoshi:
Mario already punches Yoshi to make him eat, so just jam his feet into Yoshi's sides to make him arch his back, a bit like a fleshy trampoline. Yoshi can fly (a little bit) so when stabbed, and he immediately tries to hover whe hurt (notice how Yoshi always jumps when damaged or killed), standing on the air momentarily, providing a stationary platform to jump on.
Mario jumps too fast: 
Mario's shoes store the energy for jumping and release it in a burst on command. Notice how he never crouches before jumping despite doing so other times. How else could he dodge Bowsers contraptions?
1:50 I see Yuri there
am i the only one who noticed vivaldi‚Äôs 4 seasons playing in the background
Is this ran by Matt part or this dude or is this a company I‚Äôm actually legit confused
I think u were having too much fun with the pen Austin....
Yoshi deserves it, he evaded tax
Hi Yuri
But isn't that just a theory--a game theory?
You said amphibian murder extrordenare when turtles are reptiles.
6:17 Wait, that's illegal!
but it's over 9000
This is animal abuse
6:11 Did that... Did that just happen?
anyone notice at 1:53 monika from doki doki standing in the right hand corner
Yoshi will be fine - Mario doesn't have fall damage :p
Could Yoshi be 16% heavier than Mario though since he‚Äôs bouncing higher off of a spring?
Mario is taller than me







I‚Äôm 1.48
Yoshi flutters also... When you jumps, he stands in the air for a moment in the animation.
...so uhh Austin... something crossed my mind recently with the whole "Hyperspace ramming" thingy Huldo did and also how Han explains his plan to Hyperspace past Starkiller Base's Shield...


Where should I start looking for ways to figure out how much energy a Tie Fighter would have to be applying with its blasters to shoot an X-Wing down with all that radiation and particle shielding they'd need to not go relativistic baseball when hyperspacing?


And for that matter how much shielding they'd need.
Thank goodness for Plot Armour
Hello, Humans.
Andy: Now Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind, and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special, is he'll never give up on you... ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what.
~Toy Story 3

TERRANCE OUT
I'm starting to like Austin more than Matpat.

Scott: Fool. This isn't even my final form.
Matpat : I can finally rest-




Scott : I beg to differ
Matpat, this is the seventh time you brought your Final FNaF Theory to Class.
Fans: Okay so FNAF is over?

Scott: Yes.

Fans: Okay. We believe you.

Scott: 

Fans: 
Matpat hears knock at the door

Matpat: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE DONT BE SCOTT



Milkman: hello

He knows how to give you leagal advice
Scott‚Äôs Team: Accidentally posts fan art 

Mat Pat: FRANCE!
I actually love learning about copyright issues around art and fanart, it's always been a big interest of mine.  Great video.
Hey ya know matpat fnaf came back....but


BENDY IS BACK TOO!!!
Matpat:*Screams*
Plot Twist:
New Animatronics and no longer fnaf 



My theory is bad;-;
Oh dang, did Scott take down his comment in his video? Well I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised...
Matpat: I'm gonna tell the FNAF storyline.

Scott Cawthon: I'm gonna end this whole man's career
MatPat: is it over...?


Scott: weLL YeS, bUT ActUALLy nO
Everyone: We love fnaf, but when will it end?

Scott: idk...maybe never?
LOOL
Rule 35: if there's no adult material about it, it will be made.
Matpat: it‚Äôs over... I‚ÄôM FINALLY DONE
Scott: insert concerned Tom and cat meme
Matpat: ‚ÄúWe cover a lot of scary stuff on this show, but today is... No clickbait, the scariest topic of all... Copyright.‚Äù
11:22 Blue with Rainbow mane 
11:30 Pink with Pink mane 
Make up your mind XD
Can you do a theory on Deep Sleep by scriptwelder? It's a great horror game with a great story and a lot of unsolved mysteries.
What if you send your friend a video or/photo of fan art? Would that be a personal use?
Congrats, guys, we trolled Scott!
Scott: IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Internet: I
Deviantart: Exists

Copyright law: I'm about to end this man's whole career.
Scott: T-P O S I N G  O N  M A T P A T
Matpat: intense sobbing
Copyright¬© stop it! U are, ruining everything
Matpat: Finally, I can get some slee-


Scott: wake up
Mat:oh ok I'm done with fnaf

Scott:lol nope
I feel like Scott made a YouTube channel to just watch Mattpatts theories and say if he is wrong or right.
Did anyone see the children's shoe in Freddie's chest cavity in the third part of the help wanted trailer?
Thank you Game Theory/Mat Pat! Without you FNaF would be a big mystery.
Me: sees thumbnail and clicks the video yay, finally a new fnaf theory
Matpat: talks about copyright the whole video
Me: why?
Matpat: Exists


Scott: it's free real estate
FNAF fans: Draws fan art that is just as good as his
Scott: I‚Äôm so proud of this community
Matpat: Finally the end of fnaf theories!! All done!
legit 10 minutes later
Scott: Drops out teaser



Matpat: crys in a closet
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly...


FNAF keeps coming bacc
TGT: Talks about copyright

literally has Xbox 360's achievement symbol as their channel logo.
Dawko: Make your move
Scott: Ok
[Adds New FNAF Game]
Matpat: Oh come on!
Uhhhh.... the rule 34 overwatch has damaged their brand

One of my guy friends won't play the games because he's seen too many of the rule 34 images, and can't play the game without thinking of them....
Matt: yes! I‚Äôm finally done 







Scott: hehehe 
Scott is like thanos,
With one snap
He can end the half of fnaf.
Is the Pew News rip-off supposed to be ironic? ü§®
Me: how many Fnaf theory have you done?
Matpat: How many loaves of bread have you eaten in your life
Y THE MOVIE I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE IT AND U THROW IT AWAY, Y IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD SCOTT CAWTHAN YY!!!!!üòíüòíüò≠üò≠

( what about FNAF speed edit?)
Hey mat. You're forgetting something. You know. I told you last time. It's fnaf's theory rival. Petscop.
Why does the pixelated Eiffel Tower look like a covered up middle finger? (or, the other‚Ä¶ thing)
Idk why but the fan artist in prison had me laughing for so long XD
Hey Matpat I was wondering, There's this old game called carnevil, and although it is old the ending is mysterious and strange. I was wondering if you could do a game theory about the game.
I have a poem.  

Poor litte matpat, sitting in a closet, hyped up on diet coke and counting foxy toes.  
He thought his job was over,
He thought he had disclosure.  
Then scott anounced another game, And matpat lost his composure
Um fnaf vr has been delayed and will release in May 28th instead of May 21st
0:34 For legal reasons that background is familiar
Being scared of copyright now
A little stress
Being scared of copyright after article 13
Tons of stress
Remember when we all thought that MatPat was ScottüòÇüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That teaser picture was not only on there for a few hours. It was there for at least 2 days
My God the internet is waay more confusing than Before!
When you said copying people things.do you now the Titanic why I said that is because someone is copying the Titanic. I'm a big fan.
MatPat talks about Copyright

Article 17 joined the game
Lucky for me I keep my terrible fan art to myself
At 2:41 MatPat was wrong, the fan model for Springtarp was him looking brand new and fixed
I thought this was going to be about the cringe worthy fan art [cough cough] shippers [cough cough]
I wonder why Scott only talks to Dawko...
MatPat: So FNAF is finally over!
Scott: makes FNAF VR: Help Wanted
MatPat: aM i A jOkE tO yOu!?
MATPAT: A Big Man....


Scott: DID YOU JUST CALL ME FAT!!?? OKAY I‚ÄôM MAKING MORE FNAF FOR YOU TO COVER! HAHA GET REKT



 

MATPAT:  * shows the copyrighted trailer of Scott‚Äôs *





YouTube: COPYRIGHTED
Nobody:
LITERALLY NOBODY:
Scott:new fnaf you want rogerthat
MatPat: *is finally finished with FNAF

Fnaf 7, 8, 9, the movie and 5 books:
ALLOW US TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES
MatPat: Finally FNaF Is Over.


Scott: Hold My Beer.
MatPat: calls himself Gloria Borger
9yr olds: Wait that's illegal



Edit: "Holy fish paste..." Thank y'all for the likes :)
Wait just a minute are cosplayers safe!?!
I didn‚Äôt know this became a drama channelüòÇ
UR THEORIES R AWSOME AND VERY INTERESTING I LOVE IT!üòÅüòâ
Matpat=William Afton


All new games that matpat did theories on=ultimate custom night
I am game draw artist Shayla game terroris mostly fnaf.
I actually jumped at the beginning üòÇüíÄ
1:14 To love, You know the rules and so do iiiiiii
FNAF vs matpat

Round 1 fnaf knocks out mat with a good hit of copyright
Round 2 mat fights back with article 17
Round 3 but it looks like it might be the end with fnaf slamming mat with a locked box
Final round OH OH MATPAT COMING WITH ANOTHER THEORY
MatPat:we cant legally post these images.
Also MatPat:here are some examples
Scott: This is MY art! My BEAUTIFUL art!
Copyright: Not so fast.
Me: searches Eiffel Tower at night
Dad: why is the FBI here
Finally a new Fnaf theory
Edit: lmao the news got me.
Yeah, tell that to Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft and Disney/Lucasfilm.
Also, When it comes to Overwatch: It is NOT Rated T when its company decides to push Sexual Deviancy in its characters.
YOU MISSED SOMETHING IN FNAF 4!! It is all a dream the bite victim was having in the hospital after the bite of '87. Which explains why nightmare golden freddy in Ultimate Custom Night says, "I assure you, I am very real." and "This time, there is more than an illusion to fear." =)
And just like that, the comments gone...
BLUE SKADOO WE CAN TOO! I love Blues Clues.
When u realize that u copyrited the copyright symbol
matpat green screens himself into his own living room
Can anyone tell me what happened to crying child‚Äôs brother?please?can he be jeremy?
There seem to be 2 important lines for FNAF 7 1.remember Jeremy scottgames.com  2.I am still here fnafworld.com
Also the I am still here comes with a BABY image which seems to be pointing to a sister location story
Scott.... Just leave mat alone damnit
This has me thinking, could I charge for labor instead of content? My poster is free, but $6 to produce
Yeah I don't think making a picture of nightmare mangle and posting it doesn't mean your in jail or copyright
Okay...I see what you mean. But one thing still questions me....AnttheZombieSlayer made his oc like Mario with brown skin and a black/gray cap....but at the same time, he is featuring Mario and Luigi as his teachers and giving credit to Nintendo. Would he still in trouble for all this or not?
I just thought of something what if candy codents story about 5 into 1 is the new fnaf 7 front pic all of them into one
If Scott posted my fan art for his game.
(See's fan art on teaser image)



"YEEEEEEEESS"
When MatPat makes a cringy dad joke, it's okay now since he is one
New FNaF game and book series
12:19
‚ÄúWha.. you have photographs?!‚Äù
He protec

But most importantly
He hate FNAF bacc
MatPat- alright I‚Äôm done with this series! I‚Äôve figured it out and FNAF is over!

Scott- hold my beer.

Matpat: finaly done 
Scott: well u made the timeline and i'm gonna destroy it
Matpat: whyyyyyyyyyy
Mat can I have your jacket please. TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT
By 8:39 I forgot this was a fanf video
I didn‚Äôt know Gloria Borger hosted both Pew News and Pat News. She also looks a lot different here than on Pew News, but that‚Äôs probably just me.
Matpat is actually going to break down in his next FNaF video, it‚Äôll cut scene to him rocking in the corner crying over how long he‚Äôll do dead children in the 80‚Äôs series
MatPat. You missed the chance for "Mangle, Mario, MewTwo and Merida" XP

That's okay, I won't hold it against you. I hope Steph and the baby are doing great!!
Me:ooh a new fnaf video 
Watches video 
Me: umm is this just talking about fan art and court stuff AHHHHGGGHHHHHHHHH I THOUGHT THIS WAS FNAF!!!!
MatPat: No more FNAF theories.

Scott: Nani?
Matpat: we review many scary things but this is the most scariest thing.... COPYRIGHT!!
Jumps out of bed and starts yelling
MatPat: Finally Fnaf is over


Scott: well yes, but actually no.


Rule 34 and Article 13: for the legal reasons, actually yes
‚òÖ¬´‚Ä∫¬°¬ø‚Ç±¬∑¬±<>‚Öõ‚Öî‚Öú‚Å¥‚Öù6‚Öû89‚àÖ‚Ä°‚Ä†

‚Ä†
7:12 So it's illegal to use minecraft tutorials?
Matpat: When will FNAF end?

Scott: Yes.
Sorry
This video is unavailable because of Article 13
MatPat: I'm leaving, for good.
Scott: WHAT!! NO!! PLEASE!!
MatPat: I'm sorry. We've had a good run, but..this is goodbye.. =walks out of door and closes it when outside=
Scott: =SOBS ON FLOOR=
Scott: Wait..
Scott: =Glances at computer and smiles=
-later
Matpat: =opens door=
Scott: =Smiling= Hi!
Matpat: I hate you sometimes.
Scott: Love you too! Ready to make another theory on FNAF?
Matpat: LET ME GO
Scott: NEVERR I LOVE YOUUU
Matpat: IF YOU LOVE ME LET ME GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

# YOU_POSTED_THAT? (by smosh).
Matpat thinking it was over


SCOTT HAS JOINED THE CHAT
MatPat: So you're finally finished with Fnaf?

Scott: WE DON'T DO THAT HERE
The amount of research and time and effort that goes into the GT videos (especially ones like this) is incredible
Fan artists: I'm going to draw this character I like and say I own it.

Mat Pat: actually the people that created the character own the right to it

Fan artists: 
Mat your comedic timing in this episode was brilliant , the part about ‚ÄúI drew a pink pony very accurately ‚Äú and the ‚Äú for a friend‚Äù part with the overwatch stuff made me laugh so hard , your doing great man.
corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.

scott's design team: they're the same picture.
MatPat, I think he pulled the teaser because you solved it
Look, Freddy has a 3 finger print above his eye. O.O
Me: Oh wow a new FNAF theory
MatPat: The Eiffel Tower is illegal
MatPat in the last video: SprinGtraPs nosE is the same!
Veiwers: If you say so..
MatPat in this video: Slight differences!
Everyone plus MatPat: k yeah they do
Me: cries and closet  Great. I do fan art for instagram. HERE COMES COPYRIGHT CLAIMS.
Great vid as always... but the old format. Bring it back. We only need you on camera for quick bits and GTLive
Touch my Rule 34 and I'll itch for Revolution.
YouTube: AND DEMONETIZED FOR TALKING ABOUT COPYRIGHT
Oh copyright, the devils creation 
Ya know, I drew sonic and posted it, I know I'm a law breaker, fight me
Why did he suddenly look like a dad after he became one?üò≠
....you'd make a GREAT  lawyer
Game Theory: MatPat is Actually Scott Cawthon
Two videos in such a short time? You make me anxious... what's wrong?
The funny thing is when I saw the teaser I could tell TT they used fan art. Too many fnaf videos
Scott, can I sell the fan art poster?



He didn't answer me in 6 years.
omfg how is this game still alive
Matpat: rule34'
Me: what's rule34
searches it up 
Me: I want to die now
MatPat: Fnaf won't have anymore games after the V.R.


Scott: Are you sure about that?
I support you Mat! I trust your judgement üëç
Matpat: Ahhhh, I finally can relax and take it easy-

Scott Cawthon Has Entered The Chat
MatPat: Doing all that research has kinda got me worked up. 
StephPat: sigh I'll get the Freddy Pajamas.
HOW is matpat still relatively SANE????

Matt: I've figured it out! I've solved FNAF!
Scott: Acctually not quite, there's this too.

Thanks for such a big info. Even though I'm not a fan artist.

Also, 12:37, I know you didn't do it for a friend üòè

Matpat: finishes last theory on fnaf

MatPat: I told you
Everyone: * cries in all languages *
I wish I got to see this in school when we were learning about it, would‚Äôve made classes so much more interesting. Imagine, getting to watch MatPat during school, for school.

Video: gives a copyright lesson 
Me:Just because you‚Äôre bad guy, does not mean you are bad guy
Mat- u missed what I noticed, in my opinion a very important detail in the teaser, a hand print above freddy's eyebrow, I don't know if it was fan art but look. I just saw it, thpught u should know
Hey matpat are you going to do a borderlands 3 theory once if comes out? @matpat
So basically people are bullshitting to scam each other out of money.
MAT are you wearing FOUNDATION ?!?!?!?!?!?
I'm turning up the brightness on his apology.


...Nothing hidden there. He's bright enough.
I can't stop thinking about how the Odd1sOut & Game theories voice sound similar
When People ship Scott and Matpat....
Ok I watch this play list every night and I‚Äôm upset that it‚Äôs no longer in order that used to go from your first to your last and this video kind of throws it off make me want to watch something  else at night.
In this video, I learned that... 
MatPat made it seem like non-biological familial issues with him and Scott vs Dawko and Scott. 

Mat sees himself as the neglected child, and Dawko as the praised son, but hey, that's just a theory

A sad-ish theory. :T
I kind of copy righted by brother oc and he sued me.
‚ÄúToday is the scariest topic of all... COPYRIGHT!

Me: AHHHHH! SHUP UP, YOU‚ÄôLL SCARE THE CHILDREN!
Scott:FNaF 9 but its VR
I WANT A BOOK ABOUT BENDY's STORY.
I love 2019 too Mat..

Or do you have to credit the performers/orchestra playing the piece?
Hey mat i have  a theory 
The name on one of the game paycheks is jeremy the same name as the child inside bonnie so mabye it is all a horror attcracion that went wrong allso created by henry and purple guy
This is like ABC news but for gamers lol
when your art is so good people thought they were canon 

That's the equivalent of being called a hacker just cause you're so good at a game
YESSSS I LOVE THAT BLUE‚ÄôS CLUES REFERENCE!!! <3
You know, the fan probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone to court. I think it would be an HONOR to have MY fan art in a FNAF teaser.
unrelated: what's the track from 15:50?
what are these sounds in fnaf 6
[the <<audios>>]
what do they mean?
Matpat: FnaF 4 : the final chapter

Scott : Hold my beer
MATT WHEN YOU FIRST PULL THE SITE UP IT SAYS REMEMBER JEREMY AT THE TOP
MatPat: FNaF is over, finally I'm free!
Scott laughs that is cute, Mathew, there is more coming, I always come back.
Mat pat: whew finally done with the FNAF lore, I‚Äôll die if I do another jeez

Scott: I‚Äôm about to end this mans whole career
Fnaf ended 4 times

Matpat: hold my beer
MatPat: FNAF 7 is going to be the last FNAF game in the franchise.



Scott Cawthon: Hold my diet coke
You almost went to court
Wow... I can't believe I'm french and didn't know I wasn't allowed to publish photos of the Eiffel Tower at night... That is fairly stupid.
So if I bought a fan art sticker of mercy does that mean the person I bought it from broke that copyright law?
So basically, an Article 17 for art.
About Scott Cawthon being in this comment section...

"HE IS HERE..."

-Icon Of Sin refering to DoomGuy
Oh Yay, more flippin' fnaf, üòñ
at 4:50 why do i feel that this background makes your skin patchy looking? ..or is it make-up O.o
Guys when i think to all the theory of fnaf if you all remember fnaf UCN is an hell for william, so why in fnaf UCN there springtrap and scraptrap?
8:52
Prison is French Prison(French)=Jail(English) 8:52
"Does that sound dumb? You bet it does! In fact it is do dumb that it can't be anything other than... The 2019 hyundai sales event going on now!" What genius ad placement, honestly my hat is off to whoever had this idea.
Wait didn't you decode a hidden message on one of the fan art pieces
"Basically Blizzard wanted people to skip from rule 33 to rule 35"

But rule 35 is a direct tie in to rule 34, in that if something doesn't already have lewd content, it will soon.
I got an idea for a fanaf thirey intro based on the sister location trailer "don't theorise agents us, don't theorise  agents us, you don't know the editing we've been through"  ehh, ehh
Then I'd like to know why people arent getting copyright warnings...
I started watching this  a long time ago sooo I don‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm 10 

And did they fix it
What are you in for?
Killed a guy. You?
I drew a pink pony VERY accurately!
We are happy that we see that U understand

I got an Eiffel Tower image that wasn't blurred blurred
Mmm,Very Interesting, I Mostly Agreed With All Of This,Although This Made Me Think,If this is the issue,Then What About All The Fanartists around the world that like to Draw Artwork For Games?
It‚Äôs only a theory A GAME THEORY
Scott: I'm done with Fnaf.
Also Scott: I really want to make MatPat suffer today...


Edit: Holy crap, that's the most likes I've gotten on anything!
Can I just say that I totaly LOVE the editors notes? xD
I want more Bendy theory's
I LOVE 2019 ~Matpat 2019
But I love my artwork
THAT'S JUST A THEORY...
Next 8 waht next ?? Whatever it is thank for the update I don't now what I'm saing
New intro new background who dis?
hmmm. but what if you give credit or making the person who "originally made it" or make him/her become a part of the game, making him/her a part of the game
the truth is that, during the centuries many great painters and artists used ... "used" references, others' works as "inspiration" etc etc. it's not a new thing. I thought Scott absolutely has the rights for his characters, and I don't think he's that kind of man, who uses fan models without asking. that was clear. 
there were sadly some...tracing issues in the past (in the fnaf fandom. you are on reddit, you probably saw that) that's what made me think about the thing over and over again, since I'm a fanart maker artist too. well, let's be honest, sir. young audiences don't give a damn about at least crediting artworks, just go on instagram for example, and bam, you'll drown in uncredited art. these people should learn somehow, that we are actually being hurt, when our name isn't mentioned under a fanart that we made, or it's not told to us, that our work has been reposted.


also.
you just told the main thing about making money out of our fanarts. obviously, the characters don't belong to us, credited or not. but I keep bringing up to friends, when we see an artist alley on the local con in middle Europe, that probably for example the Ghibli Studio has better things to do than make a visit, and charge money for the sold fanarts. but who knows. the main question about it is that....how quietly does it happen? how many people know about it?..obviously, you can sell more copyrighted merch on an anonymous eastern european con, than....in the US. but this whole topic seems to be unsolved, just like the nsfw fanart in google, which keeps bugging me too.
Court: choose your lawyer
me:uhhhhhhh..
Court: hurry up already!
me ( looks at madpat )
me: I want him as my lawyer 100%
Court: you chose a good lawyer
madpat: I'M NOT A LAWYER!
Eiffel Tower at night....you mention photos but what about videos because Hoseok....
Wait, so you mean I can't do fanart or a famous person and post it on twitter and that I have to delete it?
who knew that a video like this inspired me to write my college paper....thanks Matpat!
I think the rule 34 strengthened the overwatch brand online
Matpat: its over finally!!!






Scott: well yes but actually no
Wait was that why he got arrested for his fan game(in the video)???
10 years of this and there will be an FCU(Freddy Cinematic Universe) Endgame.
doesnt that mean that mat copy righted by showing the photos
And don‚Äôt even get me STARTED on rule 34
This week on game theory

MatPat: Hello internet welcome to Game Theory
Me: No its "Hello internet welcome to Pat News"
It's sad to think about the fact that everything is copyrighted....
me: yay new fnaf video "watches video" why MatPat why only a copyright video about the trailer
Hi Mat i was wondering if you can make an episode where there are some short honorable mention theories that you can make (especially Mangle he is very interesting). Thanks!
matpat... you do know rule 35 is a follow up of rule 34.. "rule 35: If there is no ---- of it, it will be made."
Mat said Gloria Borjer instead of gloria Borger
I love your fnaf but not fortnite fnaf what makes you real good

OMG GLORIA BORGER ALSO WORKS FOR GAME THEORY, what else does she do, she's such a talented woman
Do a film theory on how spider man walks on walls because technically he would have to have REEEAAAALLY good core strength to keep his head on the some fece as the wall so ethier the strength or ... HE CAN SWITCH GRAVITY FOR HIS BODY.

Copyright law: Can we copy strike them right now?
i cant find any difference beetween funtime foxy and the fanart foxy
Here‚Äôs the thing.
It‚Äôs legal until the copyright owner sues
The book is no surprise because in the back last page of the freddy files it tells you "There is at least one more novle in the series forthcoming, and the only thing we can say fof certain  is whatever's next for FNAF is certain to fill your nightmares.   

Sweet Dreams."
Thanks to article 13...
Scott: Steel Wool, let me see what you have!
Steel Wool: A fanart!

MatPat rule 35 is

‚Äú The exception to rule #34 is the citation of rule #34‚Äù

''PAT NEWS'' litterally not copyright
Do a kingdom hearts 3 theory
Omg in the fnaf 6 minigame midnight motorist the easter egg behind the house are animatronic footsteps.
üò±üò±
This was a lot interesting. And it is really important to discuss these types of things with article 11/13 coming along the world. Scott is a really smarth man, he knows what he is doing, and that is great for the future of anything he does, and for us his fans!
Mat: Ok, I'm done, again
Scott: (To his team), Hold my non alcoholic beverage
Also Scott: (To MatPat): I always come back



Edit: wow, so this is the power of commenting jokes early, hundreds of likes

Copyright and copyright issues we're getting worse because of some gay Bois and then the EU be like "allow us to introduce ourselves"
Honesty in this day and age it's amazing to see that someone who has such an influence in the internet admitting to their mistakes. All the power to ya Scott.
Should be 3 FNaFs. period
Basically me after hearing Matpat's explanation about posting pictures online illegally:
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
 
Can anyone take a guess which song I'm quoting?
matpat remembers me saul from better call saul
Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt care if Scott took my art I would think I‚Äôm a good artist
‚ÄúI drew a pink pony.... VERY ACCURATELY‚Äù
Did anybody else realize that the blue background to the video was a Magic Eye illusion?
This is why copyright is overly specific.
5:23  ...*Cough Cough* Voice Crack Crough then clears throat

MatPat can you do a Momo theory?
12:26 "Skip from rule 33 to rule 35"

Rule 35 says: "If there is no p*rn of it, p*rn will be made of it."

Uh yeah, better skip that one too.
Blurred Eiffel Tower looks like a phallus.
Y'know,this reminds me of the time i was talking with my buddy Orville...
We where sitting by a hill,drinking a nice glass of hot chocolate. Oh,
have you ever had it just right where the chocolate and the milk with the
marshmallows? Oh yeah that's nice...So,me and Orville where sitting down
When I fell over the hill and got my chocolate over me. Orville came down 
to me and asked if I was fine,I was but the fall made me think. What if my
hot chocolate was owned by somebody else? But after I was laying down 
on the hill,oh have you ever just sat down on a hill? It's really quite nice.
This got me thinking that this was to much. And this is the point! You 
can't read into everything that happens. That's just life I guess. You can't 
Read into everything that life gives you. You really can't. Hey,I guess
That's just how it goes,huh? So,I was sitting down by a river next,
being that I was sick of the hill by now,seeing as I tumbled down it...
Y'know,that reminds me of a time was talking with my good buddy Orville...
my torch is already lit
News pat is best pat
Matpat- Fanarts technically illegal
Me- running to delete my amino
The FBI-

The intro spooked me
Wait a minute, wouldn't that mean that cosplayers who make money selling their prints are breaking the law? Since it's not their characters
Lololol boyyy yaaaa ohhh noooo ahhhh byyyyyyeee
MatPat: This will be the LAST smash Bros game guaranteed 

Nintendo: Hold my beer üç∫

SCOTT SCOTT SCOTT SCOTT SCOTT
Scott: reveals a teaser

MatPat: Crap

Scott: 

MatPat: HellYeah
Legend says that fnaf will stop when MatPat dies
Matt I have a question 

Who is nightmare and all the new fnaf characters from fnaf 6?

It‚Äôs just a question
Where‚Äôs The Fanart In The Title?
Wait wait wait....so I can be sued for writing fanfiction and for drawing fan art???
......
Well, that makes me glad doing so basically amounts to free advertisement, as well as the fact that the companies related to aforementioned fanfiction and fan-art probably understand that I'm nowhere near wealthy enough for it to be practical for them to sue me. They'd probably lose more money hiring a lawyer for however long it took in court than I could afford to pay them.

Please don't sue me? I'm just some random schmuck....

Edit
-
Oh, so I'm NOT in danger of that. "Whew!" That's a relief!
Matpat: I'm done with FNAF theories.
Scott: I'm about to end this man's whole career

But most importantly 
He always come bacc
I see the Legal Eagles thing did something to you.
What's really spooky is that when I first saw the teaser, I actually thought it was fan-made because I saw Spring Trap repaired as Spring Bonnie and I thought it looked fairly similar to fan-made pictures. But then I thought it was just a coincidence and forgot about it.
New intro?
12:27 Uh...Mat? Rule 35 means Rule 34 will be made if it doesn't already exist, so maybe it should be "skip from Rule 33 to Rule 36"
Mat Pat: makes fnaf theory
Scott: Im bout to end this mans whole career
Matt have u ever reversed fnaf night 5 phone call I did and it was fast but it was words a sentence try it I know it's an old one but it's a voce try it  

 Plz it's for the fans and Scott might have hidden something the go look and keep up the great work love your vids and I'm going to buy your stuff so keep it up
COPYRIGHT OH NO WHYYYY
12:34 now i want to see some of that... Thanks Mat

ORVAL HAS 4 DETH QUOTES. ONE REFRENCES YOU.
New theory new theory new theory new theory
FOR A FRIEND......
Ennard is Henry he gets hung by springtrap then the spring lock stabs, and afton was a suit technician, not a coincidence.
Can you talk more about this issue? I'd love to hear more about this. Like what happens if you wanna create an original character set in the Marvel Universe or write comics / stories where your new characters interact with already created/owned characters?
Waits for Scots comment
This is a bit off topic, but what is the 2nd book of the fnaf series. I finished The Silver Eyes and I want to read the next but I don't know what it is. Please tell me if you know
i dont even make fanart why am i here
Matpat: Our last Fnaf theory!!! 
Also Matpat: (Overly happy)





Scott: Well yes, but actually no.

Matpat, you are truly embracing your entertainer nature. This show should be on TV.
Did Mattpatt just say 







Gloria BORJER?
Me: Comments something, gets no likes




Scott Cawthon: 
Can the Government just stop making laws about art copyright I just want to post my friccin FNAF ship art guys c'mon
Sooo, this is the world we live in... where an image of the Eiffel Tower at night is more illegal than Overwatch porn.

so rule 34 of Shrek is illegal? I'll have to delete my folder now

I am subscribed to you and have get all notifications on but i still did not get my notification for this, (excuse my language) but wtf is up with that?
Matpat would make a great lawyer.

SORRY THIS VIDEO IS UNAVAILABLE
outro song?
Nice to see something decent on your channel since a few years ago
@Matpat with the teaser I just notice that the animatronic look a bit melted like the fire in the previous game didn't work...


What I mean is that the animatronic look like it been in a fire a fire that haven't successfully destroyed it
I LIKE TERTEI
Me: Uploads a drawing of the Eiffel Tower that I drew
Me: Why do I hear boss music?
FBI: FBI OPEN UP!
My head hurts
This is NOT a theory

Wait, I just thought of this. if Cassidy is Golden Freddy then, who is the crying child. I ask this because we know Cassidy is female because of the FNAF Survival Logbook and the crying child is male.

So, Scott, when will you include MatPat in FNAF. His own soul is bound to the franchise at this point
Blizzard would have earn more money if they would have started OW porn
Its a fact a Matfact thanks for factorising.
So mat pat I was seeing FNAF jump scares in ultimate custom night and Springtrap was one of them and that got me thinking is William Afton the guy we play as in that game??
So selling fanart is illegal... Hmm

hi mat, have you ever played little nightmare? I think it warrants a theory of some kind.
Rule 34 ü§î
Can I use your video for a link please?
Omg Scott took down his comment?! It wasn‚Äôt even a story clue this time!
Matpat: am I finally done yet?

Scott: well yes, but actually no
The vr game is the 8th game
Execute rule 34
I have a big theory remember when they say the one you should not kill maybe they were talking about the crying child and the only on that killed the crying child was his brother you said the crying child was golden Freddy  and the security guard is Michael Bam hope you read this
Hey mat pat how does like all the way from fnaf 2 and fnaf 6 how is not willam afton not dead from the spring lock suit
"Today we gonna talk about copyright",
 Pew News intro starts playing
This is never gonna end
How about fanfiction??
When I saw the title I made a pewdiepie joke. Then i finally watched it and saw utter pewdiepie references.
what about oc's are they illegal too
I realised the editing is very different, like you‚Äôre in the videos!
you just had to make a porn joke...WHY?!
17:45 gaster?
SCOTT IS ABOVE ME üò± ‚¨Ü
Ok I know I'm late but something has been bothering me but in Game Theory: FNAF 2, Scariest Stories solved MatPat said 6:21 "Save him" and Fnaf 6 is emphasizing someone specifically male. I might be crazy but there's something to theorize about. :l
MatPat: Scott Cawthon just said that it's the last FNaF game!

Scott Cawthon: Well yes, but actually no.
Wanna know what fnaf question that keeps me up at night?
Just where is Fnaf 2's kitchen? And just how the buildings are set up in general. Try finding an exit and entrance in the restaurants or where you'd think the windows should go.
You have one job
Sad that Scott doesn‚Äôt talk to you even after all you have done ;-;
So all my videos should be copyrighted right?
This is how many fnaf videos mat pat is gonna have by 2020 
 I
 I
V
Put fnaf world back on steam
Okay so if you go to The Freddy Files and flip to chapter 2 the puppet giving a gift to a child this kid might be golden freddy or one of the other animatronics
i kept thinking mat was wearing a back pack
would a fnaf plush be legal if Scot did not make it?
Two fnaf theories in a row?

Alright everyone get in the bunker
I love how he is talking about Scott giving back to his community while using an image of him from FNaF world where he complains about the fans
Cringe right in my heart
Damn that's crazy
Literally forgot that this was a FNAF video.
Stop, you‚Äôve violated the law
It‚Äôs been too long since I‚Äôve had a good brawl
This was supposed to be a fnaf video but it was just a copyright video that's not a game theory
my mind is confused
I was drawing fan art while watching this üòêüòê
I have a sonic theory
Gloria Borger, I love you, you are so talented!  You hosted meme review, Pewnews and now work for Game Theory. You are an amazing, talented women!
I saw Scott‚Äôs comment and I wanted to make a reply, but it‚Äùs full... so... I‚Äôma just make it here
12:39 FOR A FRIEND
Devotion next pls
Speaking of mistakes, If in ucn your playing as william afton, then how are springtrap AND Afton there??????!!!?!?!
MatPat makes copyright law interesting (2019 colourized)
this is why i have my own characters so i  w i n
Well now I know why Foxy looked so fucky.
Why doesn't MatPat just make an internet theories channel?
Did anyone else jump at the beginning when Mat pops up from no where?üòÇüòÇ It scared the crap out of me I was NOT ready
What if this is just a teaser for the movie...  Scott wouldn‚Äôt do that.




Scott would do that...
IT'S BACK!
Is making warrior cat fanart? copyright cuz if it is ...I am dead... I make a lot warrior cat fanart
I'm enjoying the new style. Except for that weird clip with the police guy.
Fnaf is actually just a game where you must evade traps. Think about it
Yay McHanzo!
And the worst thing is
i am a big fan
I have a question about his fnaf lore theory: if Crying Child = Mike Afton, and Crying child = Golden Freddy, does that mean that like, Mike Aftons real soul is in Golden Freddy? But then, whose soul is in robo Mike Afton? **please correct me if im wrong in my assumption
Copyright laws are too restrictive. The whole idea that fanart is in a legal grey zone is bad enough.
And it's gonna get worse in the EU..
It's not the end it's just getting started
Thats crazy
I'm just leaving this here in case matpat sees and I want mat to look just too see if you can decode it but with the new teaser image for the FNAF Help Wanted game,
Idk if it's just me but it looks like there are more animatronics but too see them you half to brighten the image and look really closely you see what I think is (guessing)
Withred freddy the freddles golden freddy and BB,I will edit if I see more of them
I missed the big numbers
Gotta say MatPat, I really like the new format for Game Theory. Is this the new standard going forward or is this just how you're gonna handle the more talk-y theories?
Good to see he no longer works in a closet everyday now
Mat pat:God pls dont make more games!!!!!
I don't use it for money, I just.....draw for fun. Is that bad? T-T
draws Matpat
Matpat: what did i just say about copyright, do you even remember what i said
Me: well yes but actual-
C O P Y W R I T E I N F R I G M E N T

Me: your honer i just drew F A N  A R T of Matpat
Phoenix Write: this is unfair, it doesn't even make sense
Matpat: well that's just a theory!
Matpat and Dawko: it‚Äôs over!! Finally over!!

Scott: Hold my apple juice
IM NOT SCARED OF FNAF BUT IN SCARED OF COPYRIGHT
The green screen, is this a thing now?
So... my ouroboros tattoo (FMA) would be infringing copyright? IS THAT TYPE OF TATTOO ILLEGAL?

Oh just saw something in the fanart I saw the same handprint on freedy
Fnaf is back then bendy
The funniest joke matpat ever said is that fnaf is over.
Matpat mentions Blizzard's attempts to crack down on "sexy stuff" concerning their games
Me: WHITEMANE... NOOOOO !!!
Mentions Overwatch
Me: Oh thank God...
Not really a theory...
Do you have make up on
Frightfully
How could you mispronounce Borger. I don‚Äôt know you anymore...
Woah what's with a face cam and pew news. Is this 2019 Game Theory?





Because I love it!
mat pat hate 2019  lol
0:12 This gives me nightmares!
Mat pat : yes fnaf is finally over. No more theories, no more story lines , and no mor-



Scott : 


Mat pat : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 



Edit: lol ok it is now 2019 and I have been watching since like 2016. And btw mat pat is screaming like a dead child (them souls from fnaf)
Scott it's ok people are doing the same
Even though I don't mind actually seeing matpat I do prefer the still pic of him. I am sure I will adjust but I just like the novelty of just a moving image
Matpat: this is not click bait, the scariest topic of all...
Me: Fanart!
Matpat: copyright!
me:...that is also scary
Anyone else notice he skipped words every now and then? I cannot be the only one, please???
Listen closer to all fnaf characters all of them over and over
... 8:44
NEW INTRO! :D
Fanartist: exists


Copyright Laws: I'm about to end this man's hole career.
Most overwatch fan artist don't do porn that problem is because the fandome is mostly adults who play the rest is like me young I draw overwatch art and fnaf but I keep it to myself idk if I want to post it but  those artist that do porn also punish the regular fan artist by posting the art
Dear Game Theory,
I write you this letter, as per 4:43 minutes into this video, you advised me to watch both videos at the same time. And so I did. But I must say that for the remaining 15 minutes and 42 seconds, I couldn't quite follow your video. As 2 audio's were going through each other. So I tried, just like you always do, multiple things. I tried watching 1 without audio, and the other with. And vice versa. But it didn't quite work as it was just confusing what video 1 was about, or video 2. So I tried muting both audio's but i'm not good with lip syncing. Could you possibly give me your guidance on how to do this?
Also.. Next time be very well aware of what you advise your viewers :( I still love you though!
Mat pat listen to the voice line of nightmare ferd bear you can hear a women/kid talking
11:38 OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE GUY2
Mat: This is the last game of FNAF/Super Smash Bros, trust me

Scott And Sakurai: Laughs 

Mat: ...

Scott and Sakurai: 

Matt: ...

Scott and Sakurai: ... You serious?
My dad walked into the room at 16:51 
I'm not sure if he saw or not
Hey matpat. I know this is REALLY late but ive been wondering. In fnaf six (pizzeria simulator), why would the puppet (in lefty) try to attack and kill michael afton (the player). I understand the other souls, but the puppet is aware of everything meaning there would be no reason for her to kill michael
Hey MatPat! Can you make a theory about the Portal 2 story? I know the game is getting kinda old, but there are many questions that aren't really answered. The most obvious of course is Chell being the daughter of Caroline and Cave Johnson, but there is also a theory that says that Caroline is the true villain
Huge props to you for addressing about fanarts and their copyright puzzles, Matpat!

I‚Äôve encountered similar problems myself, revolving around copyrights of fan-made content (regarding my songs animations using songs like Another Five Nights), and until today, I‚Äôve been conflicted on the inside and worried about the topic. 

I‚Äôve been searching for a video that explains the whole mess of fanarts and copyrights, and this video sure made my day by clearing that question. Thank you so much for this.
The new style is growing on me. Seeing you all the time was weird at first, but I'm getting used to it. I don't know if I prefer it to the old style, but I don't think I dislike it either. Great content either way. Keep it up.
I miss the old one

MatPat, you know how you found the voice of Fredbear saying
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find a suit that‚Äôs right for you‚Äù & ‚ÄúThere was more fantasy and fun where I came from‚Äù
It sounds like Fredbear is using language that you would talk to a kid with.
Could that be something?
Scott: makes a new fnaf game
Matpat: makes a theory about it
Me: MODERN PROBLEMS REQUIRE MODERN SOULTIONS
I have a theory about one ROBLOX game (and guess what? IT‚ÄôS A FNaF GAME!!!)

The game theorist,I got a theory idea,what if the puppet is related somehow to Michael ,they both want to reverse the purple guys work and by the way in sister location at the Michael tryes to reunite his family but dieas trying,becomes enerd imagine the possibilities,take time to see your old video :https://youtu.be/h1rX6Ay-vZo

Matpat makes final timeline This is the fnaf timeline.

Scott Cawthon: Hold my non-alcoholic beverageü•§
Most games have things that allow fan art.
What about the hand on freddy face in the teaser ü§î?
NO MORE FNAF

What are you in for? Killed a guy 
You? I drew a pink pony very accurately üòÇüòÇ why do I find this hilarious üòÇ
In the game fredbear‚Äôs fright you actually see what‚Äôs in the box and it‚Äôs only a tape named Afton but you never hear it.

Hey just a question about fnaf 4 since the nightmare animatronics has nightmare in there name  could it all be all a nightmare?
mat is dying on the inside
Anyone miss the old theory format? 
This one is great I just miss the nostalgic feeling
What about the "no you can't" image of megamind it's based on the "hope" image of Obama
13:54 aww come on Scott talk to your homie
... and here i've been drawing some fanart my self...................... to think that I just ignored one of the first lessons in my Digital arts and Animation class... I just realized that this applies to some Doujinshis i've read as well.... AND COME ON!!!! ITS FREAKIN' FIREFLY!!!!! I'm still upset that my mom got me into it and there's that giant gap between the show and the movie. CURSE YOU REAVERS!!!!!!!! WASH DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE!!!!!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
pffft Overwatch knew what they were doing with their characters. The characters on their own can be a porno
MatPat:*shows face on screen*

Me:HE'S COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET!!!!!!
What about google earths Eiffel Tower?
Wait 3:19 Fred is Fredbear the hand prints on the eyes
Scoot üòÄüòÉ
This is what Scott wants us to think
I'm not sure if anyone has adressed this, but can we get a brilliant applause for the new format? Its interesting and keeps the interest on the screen without having the person's interest required at all times! Pretty brilliant~
HOLD ON I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING...You know in fnaf 4 Micheal Afton keeps getting bullied by is older brother in the foxy mask which leads to the bite of 83' and we never hear from him  ever again....but what if the older brother was the night guard in fnaf  2 Jeremy Fitzgerald.
stop
But surely your being a bit of a hypocrite, using fan art that u don‚Äôt own for your videos, which u get revenue from?
11:29 just trust me
A double upload?

Alright, this is extra epic.
The R34 gets even more problematic when it refuses to syop at characters that are within the age of consent. Cartoon & Anime characters from kids shows are not safe from the rapey R34. Granted, they're fictional, so it's legal( to make, not necessarily to publish or view), yet really problematic.
11:27
Scott cothan has his own YouTube channel with new trailers for help wanted
Hey Game Theory I had a theory 


At Sister Location when the purple guy had Ennard in him, did the purple guy/Ennard controlled the purple guy to kill those children at Five Night‚Äôs at Freddy‚Äôs and the other locations. And maybe the purple guy isn‚Äôt bad and it‚Äôs just Ennard who is the evil one controlling the whole thing.

If you could do a theory on this it maybe solve something and since you haven‚Äôt thought about what Ennard has done after he controlled the purple guy
meanwhile at scott's workplace


scott: corporate needs you to find the difference between these two images (pulls up fan art and canon art)


worker: these are the same images
13:54 that hurts dude.
MatPat, THANK YOU for putting in the mlp silhouette in the background during 10:58 because, honestly, that fandom has suffered from this copyright infringement the hardest - in my opinion and experience, of course...


When the show's popularity was at it's highest, some incredibly talented animators took the Youtube scene... specifically  With the help of fellow creators and voice actors, he attempted to create a series of short cartoons following the adventures of a rarely used background character (Button Mash) called Button's Adventures. Understandably, at first, it was quickly taken down for copyright. High quality creators at the time accepted this initial reaction since Hasbro had been (and still is) a very hungry animal, searching for prey to crush. So, all Jan had to do was consult the right people and get his content back, right? WRONG


Hasbro had let go of their grip for some creators, but Jan? No. They clenched as hard they could with their jaws and refused to let go. You see, a controversy had also begun to spread amongst mlp fan animators and Hasbro. Through employee interworkings and leaks, some people had gotten their hands on puppets straight from the show's official animation department. Meaning, some were caught tampering and using stolen assets for their personal, published projects. Hasbro had thought Jan was one of these people. But he wasn't. He was just. That. GOOD.


After years of wrestling with the company, he was never able to get the rights. He was legally prohibited to ever post pony content again. He, and the following that was created, was devastated.


So thank you, Matpat, for considering our plight. Many within the pony community know of the story, but it is another great example of how the big companies can just rip fan art away from the artists who had zero intention of claiming the borrowed characters as their own.
Good work.
Wait. Isn't that kinda illegal tho?
Wonder how many people searched ‚ÄúEiffel Tower at Night‚Äù while watching this video

EDIT: or ‚ÄúOverwatch Rule 34‚Äù
How did game theory go from being one of my most anticipated video creators to watch from coming up on my recommend tap every once in a while
Your videos are so entertaining
Did you guys ever think of the candy cadet story five children killed stitch together and buried. It seems as they are stitch together old buried somewhere underground with some cracks and dirt.
can you do papers please mat pat
If this rule is actually legal then... are fanfiction also prohibited?!

Does freedom of panorama apply if you're making money off of the picture, like Google Maps street view?
Who else is late because of the double upload
It feels like every time matpat is ending fnaf and satisfied with himself Scott comes along and is like "hey matpat, try to unscrable this riddled enigma"
Heavy patting
Btw i don‚Äôt know if this is important but the teaser had tv‚Äôs for all current games and 1 for the vr and the fnaf 2 office has 10 tv‚Äôs could they have something to do with anything maybe how many games he will make?
Hey, MatPat? Can you do ROBLOX theorys?
This was less like a FNAF theory and more like a lesson on global legislation, but still very informative.
Hello wingding!
I feel bad for Scot...
STOP SKIPPING THE THEME SONG!!!!!!

He is becoming a boring bbq dad
Are u pissed
Is any one confused why mat pat said Scott does not talk to him but Scott‚Äôs in the comments also Scott what‚Äôs in the  box I won‚Äôt judge you
Help us stay with us don't listen
Matpat, you should definitely do a theory on The Umbrella Academy! I would love to see or hear what you have to say about it. Just an idea but I would love to see you do one on it!‚ù§Ô∏è
Help us stay with us don't listen
OMG! If you go in the death sentences for nightmare golden freddy and he says " we know who our friend are, and you aren't one of them" you can kinda hear a child's voice behind it!
Kindergarten 2
Mat pat you crazy
Listen to me MatPat, I know this comment will be lost in the sea of comments, but you most know and remember this 7:24am est, this video is #1 on trending for youtube. Congratulations. Victory to the theorist group!!
Scared scott
Hey Matpat! So, recently I just went into Scott games, and... well, either I was in some other thing or the actual website,  but all there was... a teaser image that was similar to the image Scott took down, but it had more added characters. The Nightmarionne, Toy Bonnie and Chica, Rockstar Bonnie ( I think ), and some version of either Nightmare Bonnie or Freddy. Also, the Tab name was labelled Scot0t Games. Now, idk if this is new, old, or anything, but it might foreshadow on whom will be in the upcoming game. I'll leave the rest to you, Matthew!
why did i get an add with mr beast in it?
I once got copyrighted by someone because my persona (fursona) looked a lot like theirs. The only difference was the shade of brown. His was mud brown and mine was blackish brown, But the green markings and green colour were exactly the same and yet I Made it completely myself without any inspiration of other painters. My only inspiration were the vintage colours of old animations. So yeah, that sucks
12:23 

Rule 35: If no porn is found at the moment, it will be made

You played yourself (?
No one would see this but, would this apply in monetized YouTube videos?
MUA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA
This is one of those amazing hypothetical topics because morality Scott made the right choice but just for morbid curiosity it‚Äôs really cool that Matpat is coverings this
At this point scott is just toying with matt lol.
Matpat's REALLY getting comfortable in front of the camera O.o
this is way more matpat than I'm used to seeing. Not bad, actually kinda nice..... just caught off guard
Clicks on video looking for lore.
Actually gets law.
You do tiktok
1:26 - 1:35 THAT is what a healthy relationship between a brand and it‚Äôs fans looks like.
The scariest thing ever is







Whaluigi disappearing
We need MatPat to host meme review clap clap
RE2PECT
Did you ever think about shadow freddy and shadow bonnie. shadow freddy is in golden freddy that's why you never see him when golden freddy is in your office. Shadow bonnie is supposed to be in spring trap but afton was in there so he was never with his real body.
if you put "0rGN.jpg" after "scottgames.com" it takes you someplace new.
I thought it was just a random thing, but remember,
SCOTT DOESN'T DO RANDOM
You look like Thomas sanders
Draws Springtrap.

listening to this video....
Oh no Amino apps!
End of video:Phew,glad fan artists are off the hook.
My dad is a lawyer
matpat, if use use this with Nintendo and (insert any Nintendo based gaming channel) Nintendo could sew all of them, or am i wrong in this case?
Aaaaaah. ... what?
Actually you'd want to skip to rule 36. Rule 35 is just an extrapolation of Rule 34.
It's gotten so much better
Yes he talked uncharted
How can there be NSFW artwork of a ROBOT!?!?
MatPat, I know that I'm not relevant, but I have what I believe to be important information. When you see our Mr. Michael Afton, (Don't know what way he spells his name), throw up the robot parts, you see a bunch of eyes pop up in the sewers, three sets of them to be exact. What if this is what our Literal Purple Guy means when he says that "she" was put back together again, and he put a few others back together again as well. This is all just a theory, but it isn't coincidence, as this is Scott Boy Cawthon we are talking about here. I just hope that there is evidence that can maybe point towards this, as all of them went through the scooper.
came for fnaf, learned how to protect myself from getting sued and how to protect my friends art and games
 from being stolen
thanks matpat you really saved us
hey MatPat is fnaf maybe also based on a true 5 children's missing case
Spring trap is not William but is scraptrap.Springtrap is william‚Äôs son.Because William can‚Äôt change his suit.Please,if I‚Äôm wrong tell me why in one of your videos
if your reading this comment than that means that scott has removed his comment
I am an art student and I worry about copyright law ALL the time! But my question is, since it is technically illegal to post fan art like that, why would Scott lose all that money? The mistake could never have happened if the illegal action of publishing the art work did not occur. Would the fan artist truly be most likely safe if a business really wanted to take things further in a case similar to this?
As a fan artist for Fnaf, Undertale, and the such, I must say you scared the pikachu out of me with the talk about going to jail.
What about fangame and copied game
#fnafvrhelpwanted
basically people over complicate things possibly for their own gain but it backfires on them and takes down a lot of people in its wake. Eventually it keeps snowballing until it looks nothing like its original self which is a copy of something else. Boiled Down it‚Äôs an endless loop that sucks people in Until it loses steam. Until some moron pokes the bee hive which ends up causing the whole village to burn down over and over again. In a nutshell it‚Äôs the song that never ends that causes people to reboot the Universe only to find out it all begins again. Yes another Hillary Duff song this time the song is called Cry:

Cry love, cry war, cry innocence, but it's lost forevermore
Cry joy, cry thief, cry beautiful, that is just beyond belief, and so I
Cry at the end
Cry 'cause it all begins again
Here you are and so am I
And we cry
Cry alone, cry to me, cry freedom, then let yourself be free
To shed the tears that have to flow
To hold somebody close to you and then to let them go
Cry at the end
Cry 'cause it all begins again
Here you are and so am I
And we cry
Cry peace, cry hate, cry faithlessness, then just have a little faith
Cry at the end
Cry 'cause it all begins again
Here you are and so am I
And we cry
to be true
Try 'cause we're only passing through
Songwriters: Charlie Midnight / Charlton Clay N Pettus / Marc D N Swersky
Cry lyrics ¬© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Round Hill Music Big Loud Songs, BMG Rights Management
 

Here u are and so am I and we cry because it all begins again. 



I can relate to Scott Cawthon. When it comes to doing projects and then throwing them out because they can‚Äôt measure up to what I have in mind. It stops the creative process. It‚Äôs like having critics in your head 24/7. It‚Äôs annoying but they keep me from making a mess. It‚Äôs Like the Hilary Duff Song Little Voice:

I won't tell you what I'm thinking
'Cause it's not the same thing you're thinking too

You could say I got a best friend
And she's always tellin' me what to do

She's out of sight but easy to find
She's in the front of our minds

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

When I see you I admit
I start to lose my grip
And all of my cool
Ya' smell so sweet
Just like my perfume
What have you been doing since I left you

You're always there in my thoughts
But that doesn't mean that it's on

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

I know I sound insane like I'm playin' games
'Cause all I really want is you
But there's some things a girl won't do

Oh oh!

The little voice, the little voice!

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

I know the song is probably about relationships, but it also is what‚Äôs going on in my head. It frustrates yet keeps me from making too many messes.
I know what Scott looks like hint he has brown hair and no facial hair
Mat: We're finally done with the FNAF timeline!


Scott: Laughs in animatronic
The video was good
Or maybe all of the fnaf games aren‚Äôt connected to anything and there just games but that‚Äôs just a theory a simple and easy theory
I love your video
Only about halfway through the video now, so maybe it‚Äôll say later, but I just wanted to ask before I forgot. If you had something (like a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night) that you took when it was still copyrighted, and you just kept it for personal use, could you then ‚Äúpublish‚Äù it years later once the lights became public domain?

(Sorry for spelling i've never bean good at english and if someone could show this to pat and tell him I said this theory i would apresheat it ( and im in the midle dream and time line but the theory is on the dearm side) Can i just say the dream theory could be what fnaf is bast on. (im talking about the two endings in fnaf 3) Where you can get a bad ending or a good ending. Say whan you dont like a ending in a dream you always want to go back in the dream to get a different ending by doing what ever you can to change it. And its hard to change what the ending is because your mind always comes back to that pesifick sean you saw in your dream. Take the two endings, thay are so simular but thay repersent different things, but one thing that confoses me whan you get the good ending its 4 heads not 6 (fraddy, bonny, checker, foxy, (golden fraddy and the puppet these two arnt there but every one else is exept spingtrap because he suvives))
Matpat, I need to tell you something major I have found in FNAF that we've never seen before, but I would like for you to acknowledge this comment before I tell you so that I know I have your attention.
#1 on trending? Congrats my dude.
wow jerk I do fan art! Why us why?
With My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, some fans redubbed clips of the show to make Friendship is Witchcraft. It's an interesting alternate universe, but because it was using actual clips of the show, it ended up receiving a Cease & Desist.

Also, in the case of Blizzard... I'm all for Fair Use, but if I do become a published author, I don't want to be seeing Rule 34 of my stuff. So, I certainly understand why Blizzard did what they did, but it's sad that stuff continues to be made even against their wishes. As a porn addict, I don't want my own creations to become what I hate.
Can you guys please brighten the new Fnaf VR teaser I have and I found something very interesting like so they can see this!
so din kids can't draw fanart?
Scott: .... Publishes Fnaf Help Wanted teaser.....
FBI OPEN UP!!!!!!!
Fnaf theory is back again. I really used to love this channel back when he made more diverse content. With funnier topics and a warmer feel to it. Happy he‚Äôs found success tho. Blew up fast af
wtf matpet, we need your faf theroyes
Hey  Scott cawthon  do more games I'm a big five nights at freedys game all of them
That is just say Theroy a game theroy
Wait just a minute...

HY GUYS WHAT IS NAME OF THE SONG USE AT THE END OF THE VIDEO
I have a fnaf theory which ending in fnaf 3 actually happened
Does anybody else see the finger prints on Freddy‚Äôs head in the teaser with the melted animontronics?
I noticed something. In the NEW teaser for Help Wanted has the Nightmarionet in it. But he/she isn't a canon character. So why is she there?
I have a theory.
MatPat is Scott Cawthon

I remember in a fnaf musical which included MatPat he said something along the lines of,
 and blah blah, but I remember that it had something to do with Scott Cawthon
I‚Äôm so confused does this mean that I can‚Äôt make fan art (not that I do) or does this mean that if I do and it is mistakenly used I can sue them and if it may damage their reputation that I can be sued (WHAAAAAAAAAAT)
god i feel bad for matpat
Tbh, why is there even a dislike button anymore? Like,  no one even needs it! üòÇ
DO MORE FNAF
5:20 where is that from? BFDI(A) or something? I think Micky Mouse.
Just got real.
As long as your not gaming money from that fanart and it was made  for the creator than I see no problem with it. 
Fanart, in a way is just a gift for the creator of the character.

Edit: But do not draw anything 18+ of copyrighted characters if the game/movie/series/etc. isn‚Äôt rated 18+
BUS IN ESS
I actually like this new style of videos wish the intro could be added 
And the jokes in the beginning
Matpat you will be copyrighted for using Pewdiepie pew news cast (Gloria borger).
So I have questions about the game 

Will it have to be a new timeline? Or will it be connected to our previous timeline that we established before this?
nothing about fnaf
i wanna play that game
Scariest Theory: Scott wasn't a furry this whole time
BFDI
Don‚Äôt like the new style, put your face away Mat-Pat
whos watching this in 2020
Yo what if he did sanders sides
If I made a game with fan art and the person didn‚Äôt want it there could he sue me if I‚Äôm from Canada and he‚Äôs from USA?
Hey Matt, So I was playing the game ‚Äú Dune ‚Äú On my phone today and an Idea came to mind. The ball that you control in dune moves forward and uses dunes as ramps to move across the map. The problem here however is that the ball controls the rate at which is falls. So.. One of two things must be happening; one it is altering its mass at will causing it to fall faster or its altering the gravitational pull of the planet it‚Äôs on pulling it to the ground faster. I‚Äôd love to see you do a video on this game as it may be simplistic but it seems to have ‚Äú Interesting ‚Äú Physics behind it.
Sooo as an artist u can sell ur fanart legally or don't?
it for game idea for five nights at Freddy's game, are more close to his mindset ,and he has lot of comments with good or better idea for a game. If Scott's need someone with good idea for make new games. He will pick parts of other channel to make one game or idea.
I'm a naughty dog! staying up until 3am posting fan art on Amino! i don't chose The naughty dog life! The naughty dog life chooses me!
Oh wait another theory who made bonnet i mean we think when fun time freddy gets scooped and why the little bonny on fun time freddy so that means the little puppet on funtime freddy escaped and changed its look so you can add that on my  other theory
New meta theory! Scott Cawthon is secretly Dawko! 

Just in case before someone hates on me I mean this as a joke obviously. I have huge respect for Scott Cawthon he has made a massive franchise, and a widely popular game series that it one of the most fun games I have played for how simplistic it is when it first game on the market. To see how it evolved, and changed is something truly fascinating. I give so much props to Scott Cawthon, and actively anticipate the newest game to see where the series is going, and how the fanbase, and the story evolve with it. If, - and that if it bolded, italicized, and in all caps - Scott Cawthon, you are reading this all I have to say is. Thank you. Thank you for making FNAF, and I hope that it will always live on within the gaming community even if you stop making the: games, books, and anything else that may come.
I wanna be...... traced model

Scott and Dawko,: Besties for life!!!
Scott and Matpat,:ehh, more like mysterious person(Scott) and sherlock holmes(MatPat)
Me: when will mats suffering end?
Yeehaw matpat
i love fnaf so this video is all about fan art not fnaf!
But think of it this way. If Scott had to go to court, guessing that he lives in the U.S., he would have to have a public trial, so that would mean that many people, including Matpat, could attend, if there is space and you knew of what courthouse of course. Many people could see Scott, that could have been an opportunity!
matthew, didnt you use someones doki doki fanart without any credit whatsoever and put your face over it? seems a little hypocritical, no?
I made Funtime Freddy fan art and when I saw this video I was thinking ‚ÄúPLEASE PLEASE! Don‚Äôt make me take it down!‚Äù And watching the end of it WHOOO WEE what a relief! üòÖ I loved that picture!
Why is there like 3 finger mark looking things above freddys right eye
You should do a Sally face theory. It would be an amazing video ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wow
Hey matt! I know you've solved alot of this mystery of fnaf, however i decided to throw a new puzzle your way! Why would Purple guy kill the children, it doesn't make sense,he owns the place, right. Also, I've decided to read into mr.hippos stories, how exactly is it possible for a hippo to go to the store, so what if these are stories from his past life? I'll let you read into it!
What do you call a Mexican man who lost his car?
i forgot if you already saw it,but i was reading the silver eyes and it said 6 vary specific names of her friends :marla,jessica,lamar,carlton,john,and michael.it also said the death of michael was the reason they went to Utah, but the others were fine.it had happened 10 years ago and it says this all on pages 2 and 3 of silver eyes.

Like for MatPat who puts everything on this series (Rip MatPatüò¢)
Wait... the BARS AREN'T REALLY BARS, THEY'RE SCREENS
i was shaking in my tiny socks after watching this video
That Obama case should be a more complicated, since The subject of the picture actually owns the copyright to their image and not the photographer, in this case.
If the photographer were to alter and filter the photo in a way that was offensive to Obama and/or his "brand image", the photographer could find himself receiving C&D orders.

This is actually a big issue for Adult (read: Porn) sites and things like stolen photos/videos (The Fappening for a large scale instance) or stuff like mutually filming an amateur video where one party posts their copy (particularly regarding things like revenge porn). 

Also, Shep's case being ruled against is kind of bullshit, considering it was fairly transformative, and it's not like there aren't a bajillion pictures of Obama in all sorts of different angles.

hey matpat can you maybe make a theory on the outer worlds when comes out? love the theories btw always exciting
Dear Game theory, 
This may be irreverent to fnaf but, If The Puppet gave life to the other animatronics... Who or what gave life to the puppet? if you already mentioned it i'm sorry but, I feel like that could be really important. : )

Hey MatPat, I've been a long time theorist and SAO fan. and i just watched a video talking about potential societal consequences of full dive tech. I have little knowledge of any associated fields the Issues the You-tuber brought up and thought that it might make an interesting theory.

There! if scott does remove his message just remember this one.
How does it go from FNAF to drawing
When we thought fnaf was done lol
So if you post something on an amino that is made for that topic like fnaf does that still make it illegal ? 
Even though the amino was made for artists to show their passion for the game and everyone there knows that Scott made the game and owns it...?

Matpat alright you said about the box 5 stitched welded etc well in the concept art funtime foxy springtrap Freddy foxy and the other that's 5 all as one
LOL. I liked the Blues Clues cut/moving to next scene/reference/whatever people call it! :}
Omg Scott I loooove your games! Mat don‚Äôt feel bad! Sometimes it happens!
ive noticed something. if the bodies were stuffed into the suits, how would an endoskeleton fit in the suit? the first two answers that come to mind are clearly wrong. "they were spare suits" well... then how did the animatronics ON STAGE stink and leak mucus and blood? "they were taken out" notice how the article clippings clearly state that no bodies were found. if someone were to take them out, the bodies wouldve been found, obviously. and it would seem odd for our killer (whoever you believe it is) to shove bodies into suits and take them back out. its kinda interesting. im wondering how the souls would possess the suits without being stuffed into them otherwise. idk man. i can understand Golden Freddy with being a retired spring lock suit that would never be used again, but what about the rest of the chirren? (thats a lot of sodium üòâ) but in all seriousness what happened there? was it just not thought out enough (i doubt it tho Scott is a genius) or is something else going on...? ü§î

(this has nothing to do with the video but its a newer video and its a bigger chance at being noticed and i NEED answers)
Mans editing has gotten way better... Even from last year...
Hmmm now what about using 3D models ripped from the games to make your fanart?
OK now can you explain to me on how a peashooter can shoot a peashooter so accuratley and be so lethal

Mat, don't beat yourself up for things.
It's not your fault most of the time.

Like so Mat can see this
So Game Theory is now MatPat talk/analysis show? Not saying that I'm opposed, but it this an official shift?
oopsie!






thats so wholesome in crying
but hey, it‚Äôs just a game theory :/
I think I found a theory for you Mat Pat, you should do a theory on a game called "Prototype."

Please stop using your theory platform for hosting public awareness videos. They really belong on another channel called 'matpatt' or something. Plug that channel from this one all you want, but I would really like more granularity in what I expect here.
At the begin of the video i got jumpscared into my own tombstone...


Thank you Mathew.. >:(
I have a question, was James Charles in sister location?







It‚Äôs a joke btw
Hey MatpatüòÜ, do you think you could create an episode based on Octane from Apex Legends explaining his adrenaline addiction? is that actually possible? also, he just seems like an interesting character overall, if you could add any extra lore or theories or explanations to him that would be great! Thanks man, I love your channel!
#matpat
but that will make tik tok FULL of copyright! As there are so many different sounds lots of people copy an idea from others and stuff like that.
Matpat, can you do a film theory on happy tree house friends
Socct cawthon i am a huge fan i love playing fanf i love fun time freddy and nightmare golden freddy
Bring back the old game theory! I love your old style, and while this is nice, it's not what made me love your channel in the first place; how weird and zany the editing was and the style and setup of the videos. Its ok to try new things on your channel, but don't abandon that style completely, PLEASE.

hey, matpat the new green screen format on the channel does not sit right with me. im sure it does  not sit right with others too. i feel like it does not fit the type of content your channel makes. for me it looks like a extra bit of effort for no pay off. it may be just me but i just wanted to address it
16:00 did not expect to get an Oblivion reference
thx mat im gonna go post my metal gear fan art now
money stopped me from bleeding!
hmm... money does heal wounds
so, the scariest topic ISN'T  fan art?
14:58 "he almost went to JAYORUIT"
Copyright is a good tool to protect your work. When I go to events as an artist to sell my merch, one of the rules that is always implied is to sell ONLY articles made by yourself. Some events ask the artist to be part of it that their merch must be mostly original art. But it depends the case. Example, I have a fanart of Mario I drew and I made prints of that drawings. That's ok cuz you own the right of that specific image you made, just as MattPatt said. Of course, it doesnt apply when you literally copy the same drawing other artist made, or the official artwork of something .You can use them as reference, but your work has to be just 10% similar to the reference your using. Otherwise, it can be pointed as plagiarism and the owner of the rights of that image can demand you.  That is part of how copyright law is in my country. Don't know if it's the same in others. Good video, btw.
I'm not an expert, but i feel like REFRENCING a fanart of an origninal character that Scott owns couldn't give him trouble. If he straight up used the models or something then yea, but this way even if it was in the gray area, it's closer to being transformative.
You are awesome.  I'm not much into gaming, but I love how you explain complicated things in an approachable way and that is what keeps me coming back.

GAME THERY!!! I know it‚Äôs been so long since doki doki literary club... the ‚Äú2‚Äù game, is in the game... put all 3 girl‚Äôs except monika‚Äôs file to yandere * insert name * , it‚Äôs tectnitky, exparamentation...
In Dantdm new baldy‚Äòs basics at 13 min there is a Recording the is coded can you decipher it??
Uhhhh... I don't think you'd want to skip to Rule 35 of the internet... Rule 35 is "If rule 34 doesn't exist of something, it will be made.". Which... just rolls back into Rule 34.
12:39 i am dieing of laughter
Fnafs dead üíÄ.
Oi... What if you think out of the box?
If I make any fan art about your channel I will let you use it
You do good work Mat Pat. you circulate scientific and critical thinking. you provide a livelihood to many, and the joy of entertainment to many more. how many of your critics can make that boast. You own your mistakes and you have a generally responsible attitude. And as a fan, put out a few that ignore the algorithm. I MUST see a video on Legend of Legia. You da MAT :)
is that the new intro? man, i remember back in my day when Matpat was animated and the intro was a montage of popular games


good times...
Wow I love this editing style so much.
Edit: tbh I like both styles, I just like the change, makes it a little different, and this way matpat seems like more of a person than just a character on a screen because we see him talk and move realistically in contrast to the old style had a picture of him being used as a puppet. Idk lol I just like both. üòä
Draws a person at a different angle from a photograph.
Gets copyright claimed.
Person in photograph doesn't get a say in the copyright, wtf.
The "For a friend !" part made me burst my tea !
Such a good show !
0:05 I could feel it, this could be a good meme.
Gametheory: Quick we need to make money
Matpat desperately making a fnaf video: I gotchu fam
I actual did wonder why a Spring Bonnie was in the Teaser image, tbh
the funny thing is he‚Äôs talking about not being able to post fan art bc of copyright but he has fanart in the background for nearly the whole video lol
I purposely looked up rule 34 just to see if it was actually an appropriate
I used to upload fanart on deviantart and they would get removed everytime, but once i started crediting them to their rightful owners they stopped deleting my pics
I get what you are saying.... BUT HOW THE F DID VICTORIAS SECRET GET AWAY WITH SHOOTING A COMMERCIAL DUING THE LIGHTS BEING LIT ON THE EIFELTOWER THEN???!!!!
So, basically, the video is... but then... Article 13??
6:10 Actually went to boston on the same day this came out and rode the T xd
wHY DID you change the intro whhhyyy
Chase Baker ppl care cause the game is good duh
dear matpat fortnite is back and i mean back! no im not talking about the lava king and the ice king the goverment from season 5 is BACK! you need to show this! this could be the final part two the race to slove season 5 this no joke
Live matpat is better than thinker jpeg matpat
GT is putting far more time and money into production quality lately and it shows in a very good way. Keep up the great stuff.
Hi Matpat im really happy that you posted on my birthday :)
Edit: thanks for 1 like
Matpat:the scariest topic of all
Me:
Wait if 2 buildings can't copy eachother 

Could the twin towers take eachother to court?
Uploads my own art,
Gets copyrighted for my own characters,
Life is good...
0:00-20:26 üëÅüëÑüëÅ????
8:53 well üòÖi'm french and actually we say LA prison.
the pewdie pie stuff was kinda cringy
Love ur vids though
I'm loving this new format of vedio keep up the great work
3:35  "about rule 34"  currently #34 on trending  "wHaT tH3 F0o0o0o0o0o0o0K"
AAAAAAAAAHHH! DEMONITIZATIONS!!!
I like this video format. It's personal, clever, the transitions are smooth, and I think it's very funny
Pew news! Co-starring MatPat to fill in for Gloria Borger xD
Will the fnaf movie be included in film theory or game theory??
For a friend he says
Can we copystrike matpat?
rule 34 ftw
Clearly you just have to count the toes.
0:27 FLIPPIN' COPYRIGHT
Is hentai illegal then???
Do you, matpat, give me the permission to use my artistic ability in order to create art made by I, for the creator, named matpat?
The production value of game theory has gone up so much recently. These videos are not only informative but incredibly well put together. I‚Äôm happy for the theorist team. Keep up the great work!
This video has been blocked in EU for using copyrighted images.
Can't wait for Article 13 to do this to people. It would be hilariois how VPN sales would go up.
wait, but I-I should be in jail. I post fan art all the time. :(

Edit: Oh! Wait! I'm safe. :)
Who else just searched "Eiffel Tower at Night" after mat told us its copyrighted?
I am surprised at how much I don't mind SEEING MatPat more. It's probably way easier on his editors too. Just don't completely cut out the animations
Scott,did ya hear that,bonnie,chica,foxy,and freddy,are humqns
How cute! I LOVE BLUE'S CLUES! 5:20
I don‚Äôt care about copyright law imma keep drawing
Can you do a theory on borderlands 2 Krieg?
you mean hamilton with that fanart that ge-
Sorry Scott.  I have my Instagram photo as the Puppet master. I'll change it!
Umm..Matt....you-...you um used somebody else‚Äôs disign and...posted it on the internet
Ok, time to scare the hell out of my nephew who is scared of fnaf üòà
matt. you ok? everytime you talk you sound like youre gonna cry.... or is it just me?
When he said rule 34 and then I looked where he was on trending was 34 I was surprised
MatPat,I was listening to It's been so long,and a line is the man behind the slaughter'which made me think,freddy,foxy,chica,and bonny,aren't anamatronics...they're humans
HOW MANY TIMES ARE GONNA MILK FNAF
I‚Äôm playing sekiro. I jumped at 11:40 like ‚Äúwho the f&@k can see me???
Sorry if I spelled anamatronics wrong..
The problem is that scott previously confirmed that Jeremy is Sans and Sans is Ness (according to GT) and Ness is Mario who is also Big the Cat who is WillNE
"..skip from rule 33 to 35"

Matpat.. you.. you know what rules 33 and 35 are, right?
33: Lurk more ‚Äî it's never enough.(perfectly fine in this context)
35: If no  is found of it, it will be made, no exceptions.
IS THAT A BLUES CLUES REFERENCE!?!?!




Internet: yes it is, you aren't that special we watched it too.
90% of video: matpat explaining copyright 
10% of video: matpat talking about the FNaF image
Hi üëã
I'm just getting freaked out on how manly Mattpat's neck has become.

It's freaking me out man! Like a treetrunk with a head on it.
What I came for: fnaf stuff
80 % of the video: pictures of Paris being illegal
Mr. Mat pat,

Joey Drew studios has dropped a video called unknown April 14.  Could u do a theory about what it means?  The comment sections is currently crazy with theories
12:23
Rule 35 of the internet: "The exception to rule #34 is the citation of rule #34.‚Äù
I don't understand this... Ig  I will just not make fan art
7:35 after he says most does not equal all I thought he was gonna say Korea




But after he says people who took pictures of the tower don't get sued or jailed it made sense
Why does Gloria Borger look like MatPat
wait do you ask people if you have the right to mention characters, plz let me know.
PewDiePie disliked that.

PewDiePie copyrights that
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I have a question matpat what happened to bonnie at fnaf 3?
Why is Marat using green screen for his room
DID NO ONE SEE THE PEW NEWS REFERENCE!?!!?!?
0:34 xD he used pewds old logo backround.
I'm really liking the new format, with you being directly in the video. I hope you keep doing it.
12:27 but MatPat






Rule 35 is if there is no Rule 34 of it, it will be made.
Yeah when I'm in court I'm just gonna pull out your script and start reading the whole thing to the judge... THAT'LL GET ME OUTTA PRISON!!
Therapist: it‚Äôs ok fnaf vr: help wanted is not real
Fnaf vr: help wanted: am I a joke to you
Scott laughs in the background
it looks like you're crying like are you a good actor or just your eyes watery all the time
That pewds reference tho üëå
Matt: says rule 34.

Literally every twelve year old watching this: :}
I love the PATNEWS intro, it's so original!
Anyone else notice Mat Pat gesture to images that aren't there.
3:25
Bro I'm playing overwatch right now
This was a great video! Different style, different editing and a lot more visual MatPat!
I think an episode like this thrown into the agenda here and there would be great.
Nice going, Theory Team :)
17:34 that's cute he assumes I haven't seen all that before lol
In the Zelda timeline it's also in the failed hero timeline because the churches the slimes are also in the Zelda 2
I miss Judge MatPat
#PLSBRINGBACKJUDGEMATPAT
Im pretty sure Leagal Eagle could answer this in a heartbeat. BTW, im not comparing or anything you both have your areas  expertise.
Game review instead of meme reviewüëèüëèüëè
Hey Matt the new poster is up on the website turn up the brightness of the image and you'll see some interesting things!
I have no idea what's he talking about but I like itüëçüèº
Would commission count as publishing? Even if someone requests a commission it doesn't mean that that piece of art will be published
I love the videos and all, but I still prefer the old style. :(
lmao, legally they‚Äôre in the clear, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that morally they have to be comfortable with it
Anybody else jumped when he said copyright oof I was scared
muk used toxic
Pls do episodes de original way
he has make up on lmao
For a second I thought this was a new video
üëèüëè
11:18 That would be amazing. 

"Welcome to Neckbeard Penitentiary. What're you in for?"
Also, overwatch is just straight up not family freindly. & it wont be unless the option to use the mic is removed. Which would really damage the game.
H-hey mat Pat..? 
Hey..? Heyyyyy?

Wheres...blach? OH YEAH I DID WATCH ESCAPE THE NIGHT SEASON 3!! GOOD JOB YOU SURVIVED.
I love this new format! Different, yes, but refreshing
Do slender man theory about origin store on slender man plz
The editing in this video is sick. Well done GT!
Remember fnafs 4 box the Text is in Gray meaning it's the victim s brother
DO ONE ABOUT 
DETROIT: BECOMEHUMAN
I really enjoyed that editing
Do a theroy on Charlie the unicorn it's by film cow
ffs article 13
When Scott actually noticed something but it's good he's aware of the community
You should make a terraria theory
gloria borjer
10:12 that's where he did it to em
so while we're on the topic of fanart, how come hot topic has taken fan art to make items for profit? where do they stand with legal rights? can't say I'm a fan of them damaging small artists like that.
If Scott ever goes to court I recommend him to get matpat as his lawyer! XD
So what happened to the normal intro?
Did Mat decide to change it?
I kinda miss the old one.
Hey guys did you know that GAME THEORY was REAL STUDY ?  
Look it up on Wikipedia, not Youtube, or you know what will come up.
Matpat slowly bringing down and exposing everything
Congratulations MatPat for making it into #27 on trending!
Awe I love this new style with seeing more of Mat üòÇ
Who else thinks matpat should do a theory on who nabbit is because I have for a long time
The Mei stuff is my favorite
Wow can't believe Scott saw this video and actually commented! But seriously Mat BECOME A LAWYER AND STUFF YOU HAVE THE KNOW HOW AND WHATNOT AND YOU CAN DO WAY MORE JUST TALK LAWYER!!!!!
The pokemon thing reminded me of some roblox games(i only play cuz i have a bad pc that cant run anything EVEN MINECRAFT) called project pokemon and pokemon brick bronze lul
Does anyone remember Matt‚Äôs appearance on warp zone as Captain Planet?
Tbh I'm not huge on the new format. The green screen makes the blur REALLY exaggerated
He said rule 34
Is he the gameMaster
Screenshot his comment before he takes it down again
So when I played an artist via a special Twitch channel currency for fanart, including me and some Pok√©mon- was she breaking the law? Because the currency on that Twitch channel can be made by donating real money to the streamer, but it can also be made just by watching that channel! But it should be okay since I technically donated the money to the streamer? So confusing!
Have you even played The joy of creation a fnaf game MatPat
He did it to his YouTube channel go ahead and look it's all gone
lol pewnews rip off intro
Wait I have a question does this mean that you can‚Äôt have that picture of Wario or pictures of video games characters because you don‚Äôt own the character?
That‚Äôs just a theory, A LEGAL THEORY ANDDDDDDDDDD- oh wait am I violating copyright laws and ownership laws. Ummmm 
Credit: MatPat
13:57 what if dawko is Scott?  ?*illuminati music plays*
Edit:spelled dawko wrong
Mat complains of more FNAF





Still gets #1 on trending from it
Meanwhile in a AU
Cristali:hey what you in for 
Prisoner: tracing Scootalo loves Sans. You?
Cristali:in here for tracing
I've talked to Scott, he's rather thin actually.
Matpat:yah know I might have taking some fanart 
Community:wait what
12:13 "... So enjoy mchanzo!" I will! Thanks MatPat.
Loved the sekiro sound effects partüòÇüòÖü§£
Do bioshock or cities skylines anything in the game plz cringe master
What u in for  drawing  a dot then the FBI came into my room
Exotic butters= Eggs Bennedickt
You said Gloria Borger wrong
Quit mentioning all the games I'm playing mat before I buy a security system!
What if that number on the lost cat poster is matpats real number
10:55 ah that must be the Pokemon Rumble U fan patrol.
Can pewdiepie claim the video for the intro
Gloria Borjer     0:33
Please make a theory about why creepers are scared from oceolets?
Black flag was so gooooooood.
Is this a new meme format?
oh man the blues clues song
Go to Scott games you will see
He still didn't responded huh
Mat, get back in the hole and stay down there. 0:07
all i want to know is how the hell all these Lego knockoffs are legal
Wow MatPat, crediting your fanart sources, but not the sources of your legal advice. They worked hard to be able to tell you that. Clearly another new low.


XP
Do a apex legends theory like who's pathfinder creator or why is octane fighting in the apex games
Oh god anything but fan art
Oh no I heard the word of rule 34
I love the new set up
does US have freedom of panorama
Scott: oh hi mat pat I will make only one thing at a time for u

MatPat: oh really thanks

Scott: (comes out with 18 more games in the past week)

MatPat: Scott u have done it again 

FNAF: ( new characters new story same plot) 

MatPat: (after 1 month) we finally found it guys 

Scott: ps for the first one events r randomly in there that r crucial to the story 

MatPat: YAHKTTRQJYRYBQJYRUIFFINCBFIJFDUMSKG

Us: yeah MatPat see u in....... never
NO, COPYRIGHT,NO!!!!!!!!!
I love Blue's Clues when I was a kid
I loved the Blue's Clues reference
That made me cry
My bf and I were literally just watching Blue's birthday episode
we love you Game Theory
Darn it I‚Äôm late

Edit: hold up is he remaking the intro and stuff
Is this the new style
I like it
it is so weird to see him actually talking in a non-couch video.
I'm not even a big fan of FANF, nor am I subscribed to this channel. Still, these FNAF theories keep popping into my suggested and I watch 
Every
Single
One
You just make it so interesting!
Wait! Was that the policeman who made an appearance in Dayshift At Freddy's? 
Are you 'avin a giggel m8?
AHKSHUALLY Blizzard wanted them to skip from Rule 33 to Rule 36. Rule 35 ensures that Rule 34 will happen.
Thanks for posting this MatPat. I look forward to trolling the French
What about the people who react to movies in their youtube videos is that legal or not or people playing games making walkthroughs of games or reacting to games is this legal.
MatPat: Oh god another FNAF ga-
Scott: (takes teaser down due to copyright issues)
MatPat: Oh that was easy.
I can see the remaining hopes and dreams dying out in Mat's eyes as he speaks-
Awww I loved the blues clues referenceüò≠üñ§
Fun Fact: OW r34 made me buy/play OW.
I like the animated u



But u luk handsome 
Too handsome to be in a Game Theory episode.
Just be on GTLive IRL MatPat!
Great vid! I honestly learned a lot btw that's a nice jacket I like
He shoulda kept it and offered the fan art creator some money. Support the fan artists. I think that would have been a bigger win for him.
hey matpat i Really like this new style of video. with you personally green screened in!
NO MATPAT NOOO. 
IT IS NOT GLORIA BORJER
ITS BORGER WITH A GUH SOUND
you know better than that
Mat mat on scottgame.com if you right click or if you are on phone and hold down on the image is says remember Jeremy
something tells me he doesnt like 2019
The computer looks like Mettaton from Undertale 2:02
5:20 - End of shameless plug
If I had some of my fan art used by an original creator by accident I would honestly be extremely flattered that he/she liked what I had made so much.
BTW Overwatch porn is one of the few things that keep this game relavant
omg. I just realized. almost everyone is technically an internet pirate now. O.o
you should do some theories about Total War.....
And that's why we need to get rid of copyright laws...
Honestly if my art skills were good enough that the creator of the IP had some trouble seeing the difference and accidentally published some fan pics that would make my day. And I wouldnt try to monetize that (personal opinion here, not the general practice). I would try and get some kind of official statement from the IP and then use that as a basis for other IPs pay me for art work lol. But my point is the basis for this video should just be the ultimate call out to the fan who drew the models so good.
See? Everyone hates Tracers
So you copy and draw a pic from the internet is that ok?
Game theory, you should do a theory on the old game, Plants Vs Zombies. There aren't any theories on it and there's alot to uncover in the game, where did the zombies come from, what heppened to all the people, and how did the plants become aware and able to shoot at the zombies. If you dont know what the game is, I suggest you do research and maybe look into this idea. Because this is an old game, and theres like no theories on it.
* watches video.* DANG IT!!! 
ITS BACK!!
WHAT'S THE SONG IN THE OUTRO?
What if you make a fan art roblox t
Doing research                








FOR A FRIEND
New format?!?!
I love your vids
Never played the game of five nights at freddys
Oh I thought nevermind
You just don't like the game...!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
I'm guessing that Naughty Dog put those pieces of artwork in the game as a placeholder and just forgot to change it. At least with the Assassin's Creed one, they might've thought the map was public record or something
Wish you would‚Äôve noted something about pewdiepie considering you completely stole his intro #subtopewdiepie
We shoulda had this video when Epic Games was tryna sue PUBG for stealing mechanics and such, would have made Apex Legends a lot more popular since it‚Äôs a good preference mix between PUBG and Fortnite
Can‚Äôt he just ask the owners of the fan art if he can use the models? What fan in their right mind would not want their work in a potentially very good game?
I wonder who searched up the overwatch thing on google...







For a friend, of  course, right?
Did anyone see a video titled "Solving Game theory's biggest problem" mabye just me
Scariest topic of all: Tik Tok spreading across youtube like a cancer.
The ironic thing is he can't even showcase the photo of The Eiffel Tower at night in his video of copyright laws.
I love this new format, and it's just more interactive,
Mat,if you cosplay a character who you don‚Äôt own the character Count as copyright? 
Ps matpat I love your video‚Äôs and you probably will never see this
We're gonna talk about copyright
* Uses similar intro to Pew News but calls it Pat News *
Crud the FBI is gonna come after my amino and tumblr
I totally get how that Funtime Foxy model was used, it literally is flawless! It's just as good/better that Scott's model, and you'd only be able to tell the difference side by side.
But... who thought that Springtime Bonnie model looked good enough to be Scott's...?
You should make a game theory on Pikuniku, why Mr. Sunshine is evil
15:38 Wario's not your character....



Are you going to jail?
last fnaf video I said who made the its time to stop meme IT IS ZEALANDIA MAPPING
Oh no not my Sans Fan Art
Hey, doki dokiis not quite over yet. I have to admit you did a good job with unmasking the true lore but doki doki has a new game demo.
Hey MatPat, what's with the sudden footage of you walking around on screen as opposed to your normal voice over? Honestly i kinda preferred the voice over
Scott I was wondering if you could help me make a fan game of fnaf. I have drawings of 9 of the characters in the game. Thanks. Also it wouldn't let me comment on your comment
On amino people actually ask me for posters. Thank god I didn‚Äôt do anything...
Collab with Myself
Because whom else do you ask for awesome or reliable advice?
thank you for making this video... now i know i have a FNAF VR gaming to look forward i never knew about
I'm not gonna come after you with my pitchfork lit with a flame, I'll leave that to sans fangirls. It's the law. I'll follow it. Thanks for informing me, I'm actually thankful you said it because otherwise I'd be in huge trouble.
MATPAT make copyright thoery
Wow üòÆüòØ #2019üòã
Omg go to the YouTube channel COZEKO they have all the voice lines from the animatronics
There has to be a way for article 13 to be illegal. MatPat? T^T
Ohmygosh so that's why my picture of the rifle tower got taken down all those years ago!
14:58-14:59 jail or it???? whwaht????? did anyone else notice this???
Huh well this makes me a lot more worried about some things and less about others.
MatPat: Scott doesn't talk to anyone

Scott: comments on video
I love a good lesson when I stay home from school
So all the airplanes I drew are violating copyright.
Always a great time to watch your videos!
I'm going to be honest, I don't like the new format. Great video though.
When will you make another hello neighbor theory!
But I wish you would make another finaf game
Hey scott u are awesome
What would happen if you were to sell the rights to your fan art image
Just saying
Hmmm interesting.......
The Eiffel Tower's copyright expired many years ago but the lights put on it haven't had their copyright expired yet. Your pictures of the Eiffel Tower are only illegal if the lights are visible.

I learned this in History. I learned this before watching the video :)
MatPat: mentions rule 34
Me: Oh shi-
RUNS OFF INTO DISTANCE HANDS FLAILING IN THE AIR
Me: NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPNOPENOPENOPE.
Sees that he censored Overwatch rule 34


looks around room
MatPat: this is the final game intil Scott sees this video any way lets get in to the timeline 

Scott: loading....  loading.... Uploaded  

Dawko: there's is a new leak for a fnaf game 

MatPat: NONEEEEEEE Wright's a script
Pat news?
Pew news
THIS IS ILLEGAL
jk I love ya bro.
8:55 mat pat is right in is editorial note the french word for prison his prison, but since it's a feminin word it would be ''la prison'' and not ''le'' so I just thought I'd put it out there. I had a class about laws and regulation this semester and I thought your video was super entertaining keep it up dude you make awesome content.
Anyone else miss his animating style?
So new business plan :
Make fan art of every video game character and flood google search results with slight variations. When a developer uses a model ... sue. 
Thanks MatPat
BLEH BLEH, ONE OF THE FIRST COMMENTS
I would have been honored to have my artwork as the cover art/game art of a popular video game
Can u analyze my characters I wanna put in a video game I want to make,

Migra 7mph 40lbs
Homit 4 mph 70 lbs
Wu fist 14mph 150lbs
Hi kick 14 mph 150lbs
Smokescreech 40mph 40 lbs
Senslash 18 mph 40lbs
Also Scott when is fnafworld update 3 coming
Thanks for making the video before it was gone
Is it possible that if I made a game that I could make it so that any in appropriate content of the main character cannot be made but other stuff can be
If I'm in a fight I want matpat to break it up and then tell me a finaf theory
He uses the back of the xbox symbol
HAHA! When Matpat skadooded I realized how much he looks like that actor who played Steve.
Did you copy felex with your intro
Pewdiepie reference.

Immediate like.
epic.
This is why I loooove this channel. It takes boring things and makes them entertaining to watch
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people what say you in your defense
fnaf one is the only "fnaf" i firmly believe that all the follow ups are just him playing with matt xD
I like the new stile off game theory keep up the good work!
what about ticktockü§îü§îü§îü§î
I really really don‚Äôt like this format. Matt‚Äôs a cute guy but him constantly in front of a green screen talking with his hands is distracting and doesn‚Äôt add anything... and i noticed it makes his usual script writing different and slower. Oh well... I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good episode and I‚Äôm sure you put a lot of love into it but I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it enough to finish watching.
Is speek copyright? 'Cus we speek words that not we invented.
In Scott‚Äôs comment he says ‚ÄúThe fans in the community have to come first, and any company who doesn‚Äôt think that is doomed to fail‚Äù

Me: Oh ok that‚Äôs why COD died
Can you please do a theory an the umbrella Academy about who‚Äôs the most powerful?üôÇüôÇüòÅüòÅ
Hey I got a theory for film theory. The secrets of the omnitrix Ben10 reboot season 1,2,3
Welcome to the gang kid. We got stelin steve murderin mike and crimes johnson.
What did crimes johnson do?
He drew a pixalated skeleton
Really like the format of the vid matt, keep it up!
Okay.. I'll lay into you about changing the iconic game theory theme song. Grrr.
simple solution, stop doing fan art
Do a game theory on the battlefield video games phantom program
Fun fact, artists: if someone pays you commission to draw their characters, you have NO rights at ALL to the image you create, unless otherwise negotiated. 
MAKE SURE you have a TOS when opening commission slots, PLEASE!
I just remembered why I unsubscribed about 2 years ago XD

The YouTube algorithm is the real scary thing here... ü§îü§îü§î

Edit: To clarify, This has "zero" to do with the topic at hand...
7:42 "pic of my cat"
I can‚Äôt sleep now... I‚Äôm having nightmares of copyright... and you know what‚Äôs the worst part?







They‚Äôre copyrighted nightmares
Article 13 enters the battle
Matpat if you did the twisted so I can't you do the drawkill
MatPat‚Äôs eyes are so dead üòÇ
It took me this long to realize you green screen your set to make it look natural.
I thourght the IRS was the scariest thing
HI SCOTT
14:57 ‚Äúhe almost went to jai-or-it‚Äù just a little editing mistake I caught and found funny lol
Living for the new game theory style with the green screen! feels so much more personal! I love it!
You should make a channel called MEME THEORY because you made some meme theory's on this channel and your other film theory. Hope you do it!
Hey how am i supposed to watch both of these vids simultaneously!


Time to use split screen
Fan: this awfuly similar fan art is close to scott's...eh ill do it anyway

Scott: im sure this is mine so ill use it
I‚Äôm still sticking with what candy cadet said about five things becoming one! Now we have art work of them melting together like in a fire sound familiar ??
Great work MatPat, the show's new format is pretty interesting.
I was going to send you a letter talking about how it made no sense that spring trap and Funtime foxy looked like they did in the game
God damn, MatPat is looking hella fine.
The blues clues transitionüòÇüòÇ
Next Game Theory: Mario is the strongest Nintendo character.

How is he able to throw Bowser? For that matter, King Bob-Omb?
Love you Scotty C. And love you matpat. It's thanks to game theory I became a huge fan of fnaf that fateful day I watched that first episode about fnaf lore. And as a writer, fnaf helped make some of my personal favorites of my characters.
Matpat:
>talks about copyrights
>does an pewnews intro and stuff
>no information about pewdiepie anywhere in the describtion
I don't care how you take fan art and make it as your thumbnail i just care if your channel gets better and better.
Queue the eyes of the soaring LEGAL EAGLE!
nice job milking your dead fnaf series to fnaf 7
I have a serious question.

Why do fan-artists create art that (in the creator's own words) looks so similar to the original work that they are virtually indistinguishable?

Isn't it not really......."art", at that point?

Like, isn't it just a point-for-point recreation of someone else's art? For example, if I  recreated the Mona Lisa, is it impressive that I'm capable of doing that? Absolutely. But then if a Hollywood Studio uses "my" image in marketing for a movie (intended to feature the  Mona Lisa, but they use my fan-art instead), then........

I don't know. If I'm being brutally honest, it just seems like either a waste of time to recreate something exactly then try to post it as an "original" work because what's the point,  like it's INTENTIONALLY trying to look exactly like someone else's work, basically infringing on copyright? And trying to get used in a certain way to start a controversy when someone accidentally uses your "Super original OC plz do not steal" version (like this!)?

If the custom one was different/unique, then the creator  has the right to get mad when someone else passes their work off as their own, but if the  can't tell them apart, then you haven't really "created something original".

You've basically just traced it.
I hope i get to see the new game coming out and you doing a theory, before youtube gets banned in EU :(
I actully feel bad for you...
I know you might not have much free time, between feeding your hungry fans and your hungry BabyPat, but have you considered taking evening classes in Law School? You sound like you'd be really good at it.
I think Scott enjoys tormenting Matpat and only makes new games for that reason

But hey that's just a theory
A GAME THEORY
jason: so do you want to publish this legal video, or this fanart video

matpat: yes
The nose for spring Bonnie is different than spring trap so I think that there's at least 4 springlock suits at fred bear's or there's so much more than we realize
slowly takes down my fnaf fanart from tumblr..
Can you do amiture surgeon? Its lore is confusing
Am I the only one who prefers when mat was a still image instead of himself? XD
To who came in the comments before watching the video, the TL;DW Is: All hail robocopyright.
Finally a better understanding of copyright. So does this apply to streamers who react to other videos on stream/make a video, then are sued by owners of the videos that the streamer is reacting to?
Most games that do well and have a growing fanbase have a rule 34 version. Do you see any Anthem or Fallout 76 lewd images? Nope!
Nice using the Sekiro discovered sound effect for looking at sexy demon girl I loled.
I am really, really loving this new video style.
Blue's Clues!
I feel so bad for Scott and his team
pewdiepie thanks you for supporting him mat pat
Everybody is screwed.
5:19
Matt.....this is a convention........you have an addiction to FNAF........it's ok, we are here for you.
16:46
Instead of Overwatch replace that with sonic theeeen we‚Äôll get the bigger picture
When your fanart is better then your own canon art, that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs a good community üò©
I have a new conspiracy matpat. Freddy is Moto Moto
Hey I‚Äôd just like to say I‚Äôm loving this new style of GT! 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm a big fan of the older style with just images but this new ‚Äòlive action‚Äô style is awesome and I‚Äôm loving the green screen background, you walking around, more natural kind of style too!
Keep up the awesome work and as always love the vid! üíö

P.s. Hope the holiday is/was fab!
Some!
I love this format where you actually show up in the video rather than a random picture with your face pasted on top of it
"I did it just for a research"
"...For a friend!"
Yeah SURE
Omg with Article 13 being passed..... its 2k19 and MEMES ARE DEAD
Don't worry, with Article 13 passed, the FanArt won't even get uploaded anymore.
Problem solved I'd say.
Wait...
"Bordzher" fake fan T-Series supporter confirmed
MatPat: FNAF is finally over and we know everything!

Scott Cawthon: Hold my exotic butters
7:35 Just something interesting:
In germany you are allowed to take photos of buildings in public places and even sell those photos,
if the perspective isn't from a special place.
Omg I love the Pew News intro XD you are so wonderful!!!!
Holy crap I loved your editing!
Man, the editing in this episode is a huge step up! It's great!
My campus is shown in this! How cool!!! 7:29 - Florida southern college
I once said that someone should make rule 34 out of article 13/17
Yes, my country wont let you take the photo of a giant metal tower.




I love France.


J'aime la France.
I have two things to say about this. 

1) My usual "F**k Copyright in every form it takes, and any law relating to it should be abolished and done away with so fan artists can continue their practice."
2) I'm getting sick of FNAF. Fight me, bros.
I'm not working on fanart now because last time I checked, right now I'm watching this video!!
I feel like everyone is gonna be screenshotting Scott's comment and this is the one that he might not delete xD
Uncharted stealing the image from AC4 couldve easily been called an Easter egg and been done with it
Today's my birthday I turned 20
the art community already said noone work is unique its from somewhere and if you are gettign refrences and change a few thigns its not the same drawign becuase noone cna just copy it eactly
Its uhh... for a friend
WHY THE LIVE ACTION
¬¨Œ∏~¬¨
As I was watching the video I came across an amazing question, What if you take a photo with your vehicle? Does the logo of the vehicle make your photo the subject to copyright? If so can you please produce a video about it, thanks!
I just wanted to say that I love your new editing style! Keep up the great work :)
I love that this feels like a continuation of the are Fan games legal video. Great job!
Really love this video, Matt! Not sure if you started this style of video before but it feels really entertaining and genuine
Lmao it's Jeff Kaplan.
Woah, as a french dude, I had no idea about that law ! It's kinda fun to learn about it ! ^^
matpat you are the gratest i watch every upload from you and gijin im 13 and my friends love your videos never stop doing what you are doing

Wait did matpat just use other people‚Äôs fan art
<plant burgers?
8:17 Ahh, irony.
Thing about fnaf hw:in the silver eyes novel  it says that bonnie glitches out and thats when he had soul juice in him and in fnaf help wanted foxy glitches out when he was repaired and since it was before William was trapped in HE(double hockey sticks) the two engineers could be william and henry since they both built the robots but thats just a theory A game theory
Pat news?!? Nah more like pew news
Caffeine
?
Do you want to show a picture
So where does fanfiction fall in this copyright mess?
Matpat: finally  finished with this stressful timeline. 

Scott: yep we‚Äôre not down yet
Youtube did an oopsie for putting this vid on trending instead of congratulations
Holy Mackerel, Scott actually commented on this video.
Edit: Also I'm pretty sure it'll be deleted soon.
"what are here for"
Me- I made a animatronic and night guard oc ;-; yeeeeeaaaaah SCOTT CAN GLADLY US MY OCS IF U NEED THEM  I didn't make models tho sorry

Cmon a trailer dropped and you haven‚Äôt done shat
* clap pa de clap *
HEY HEY HEY, MATE
I have FanArt for you but i have NO idea how to show you T^T
Can you tell me how maybe?
Anyways, Love your theory's, it actually helps me and my entire SCHOOL gain some knowledge from your awesome wisdom!
I‚Äôll fix it for you, 
Even Super Smash Bros Ultimate had to change a spirit because it was fan art that spirit was masked man from mother 3
I'm still not sure how I feel about this Live-Pat format, but I LOVED the Blue's Clues reference!
QUESTION
          Do you wear Stephs foundation?
   It may just be lighting but I‚Äôm just curious.
12:35
How can people say the old Game theory is "so much better" when the quality and humor of these videos has DRAMATICALLY Improved! Great Job!

It's a bit odd that a fanartist can say their work was "stolen" when they've drawn someone else's intellectual property.
16:16 MATPAT HAS READ THE FANFICS! HIDE!

Good job with the ‚ÄúMatt‚Äôs Brats‚Äù and it being with Mark...
Oh gosh did people really freak about this... seriously I‚Äôm an artist my self and it‚Äôs just common sense if you put your art out there on the internet it‚Äôs bound to be show up all over the place unless you put your name or some other identification you can‚Äôt be mad at someone like Matpat or someone else use it ...the only way to really be pissed is if you put your name on and they just cut it out with out giving the artist credit then be pissed but Mat is not a bad guy don‚Äôt do him like this...üòï
I love how Matpat handles this. He's clearly frustrated but at the same time is so so mature in accepting that he made a mistake. He was doing his best trying not to make it sound like he was just making excuses and I think he did a great job! He even gave out tips on how to help others avoid his mistake. dang. this is why I love his channels ‚ù§Ô∏è
part of the problem is that nobody's allowed to be wrong anymore. you're not allowed to make a mistake, everything has to be malicious and evil. people need to grow up and just realize that accidents happen.
Fan artist here: I can understand why some artists don‚Äôt sign or watermark because it distracts from the image, especially if you‚Äôre TRYING to make it look 100% legitimate. There is flattery in tricking people and being SO GOOD that you can‚Äôt tell the fan art from the original content. That being said, most artists take it as flattery when their art is mistaken for the real thing. What gets their panties in a bundle is that you‚Äôre making money off it and they‚Äôre not. So really it just boils down to greed, jealousy, and a sense of entitlement.
Everytime I see one of these I'm afraid it's gonna be the end of Game Theory
Doesn't put watermark or signature then gets upset about not giving credit?

I can't stop laughing for thinking 'bout mathpath's son having a conversation with his dad and then hearing:"But remember son, that's just a lecture, A DAD'S LECTURE, thanks for listening, now go to your room, you're grounded".
Yeah, I feel bad for you Mat, like all these people have to say is something along the lines of, "Hey, there was an uncredited piece of artwork, at X in the video. Can you remove it, or I can tell you the username I had when I created it." or something along those lines. People shouldn't be that mad at you, when clearly you're a human like all of us, one who had, and will make many mistakes in their lives, and to be fair, it's humanly impossible as a human to know what is usable, and what is not as a creator, because considering how everybody has different settings on their search engines, each search engine being different as well, would be impossible to anyone except Jesus himself. Don't go hating on MatPat for stuff like this, because you aren't Jesus either. You make mistakes.
Sorry to hear Mat, and in honesty, you shouldn't have to make a video like this, but I guess you gotta clear up things for these people who don't understand how impossibly hard it is to use appropriate fanart 100% of the time.
Big Question is..  WHO owns the Art? especially if the "FanArt" is so close to the Original?  Where is the line between IP/Intellectual Property and Fan Art?
I don't remember the last time I watched a Game Theory but I resubbed for this vlog style content. It's really cool knowing the person behind the over the top theories.
Matt Pat - I truly enjoy your vids. Please keep up the good work. I was only able to watch this one vid and am running out the door. Will add the FnaF to the my watch later list. Thanks man. Please keep the gold coming.
He missed the opportunity to call these couch talks "ChatPat"
I really like the couch talks, BTW. It feels more personal and more real. I know it's still your public persona, but the fact that we get to see you open up in what feels like a real way to deal with serious issues, it's important to me. It reminds me that I can be great to someone even though I'm flawed. I seriously wish that there was some way I could help out with GT. Hell, I'm skilled as a bookkeeper, but that's about it. And being in Florida would make navigating that kind of work difficult. I really hope you're able to come out to Florida at least for a con or something. 

Seriously, come out here. Your Floridian fans got your back too :)
matpat knows Wattpad exists
Me:

That complaint about the Kirby fan art is completely melodramatic.
Speaking of mistaking something for something else....I thought this video was about Game Theory...as in the academic field of study for computer science (I don‚Äôt follow this channel)

I thought it was some deep lecture on the flaws with Game Theory - not a video about purple rabbit creatures

 (no disrespect intended - the presenter has a good personality and the video looks very informative)
Wait, you're telling me that Link isn't really dead? After all this time??

I feel so used.
You should call it a matchat xD
And always remember





THATS JUST A THEORY  (nailed it)
Hi Mat, this is kind of unrelated, but could you do a couch talk on Article 13?
I think your research and input could really help!
You look stressed, Mat. Hope everything is well.
As an artist I really respect MatPat for this, he explained the situation and I am not mad at him (not in the slightest). I mean how could I, how could anyone ? they were just some honest mistakes. They never even wanted this to happen. Game theory even makes a video about it to spread the awareness, I am actually really grateful to people like him having so much respect for arists and actually caring about stuff like this ! I hope he doesn't feel too bad about it, he really shouldn't.
People need to chill out, and stop reacting so violently. If someone can't tell who owns the artwork it should be the artist's fault for not leaving a signiture.
Leaving a water mark would be similar to getting a patent, only it avoids the paperwork.
Mat should not be persecuted for this...
Honestly, if I did an artwork that ended up in one of your videos, I would just love it!
Thank you for addressing this! 
I've stumbled upon a decent amount of my fan art used in random YouTube videos. With that, I have a few things to say:
First off, I'm flattered. So I leave a comment stating that I'm flattered that my work was chosen for display in their video. And since usually, the work is not credited by the Youtuber, I take charge and provide the source information. Yes, people see this, and I think that's a more graceful way of handling things. The Youtuber doesn't think much about it, but it's not out of malicious intent. It's just an asset for their video, a lot like making a collage; the pictures aren't self-made, they're taken from various resources. So if you feel entitled to credit, add it yourself or just reach out, since I'm sure things can be cleared up by talking it through.
I also wanted to say that as soon as you upload an original work on the Internet, you are entitled to Creative Commons licensing. You can license your work so that it can be shared, downloaded, and re-uploaded, but can only be used for noncommercial purposes, and cannot be traced or modified to step over that barrier. I'm not sure what YouTube videos would be categorized in that regard, considering Youtubers can and will make money off of their videos. If the video has ads, perhaps only then it can be legally pursued. But is it worth it? Well, probably not. Especially when the art itself is fan art; art that is already the Intellectual Property of a company or individual(s). That is sort of a legal gray area.
One thing is for certain, it is worth addressing those who sell copies of your art. I've had to shut this down a few times before. You are entitled to your own work. Most sellers are willing to comply if you are forward about it. Have your facts ready, and do some research on Creative Commons Licensing, then confront. 
Artists, use this to your advantage:


That's all I have today! Thank you for listening!
I wish EVERY company, group, etc, would handle things like this. 
Awesome and informative.
I don't visit your vids always, but I'm never disappointed when I do!
(Also digging the new "face to face" formatting)
YOU GOTTA START CALLING THESE MATCHATS

‚Äúbut that‚Äôs just a chat, a MATCHAT‚Äù 

 

no but genuinely, thank you so much for this video! for educating the audience and explaining everything.
*"the truly DANKEST of DEM MEMES"*~matpat 2019
Is the problem click bait titles??
6:46 why does matpat face covers this perticuler zone this can't be a coincidence right? ü§î
Uh oh, did you get permission to use the elements from the periodic table?
Every time i see a couch in matpat's video, i feel as if my GF said to me "we need to talk"
‚ÄúBut hey. It‚Äôs not a Theory. A Total Reality.‚Äù
"THAT'S JUST A TALK.....A COUCH TALK!!" sounds good to me
you should really grow a villianous (black) moustache... that would look awsome
EDIT: But remember, these are just some thoughts... My thoughts (it would fit the pattern, but might sound a bit arrogant though, if you do it tn the "game theory" voice)
I dont understand why matpat gets so much hate. Im not a fan and i dont wach him that much but people tend to just automatically hate him for some reason again im not a fan but still enjoy his vids every now and then
Nobody:
Jk rowling: MatPat and Scott have a secret burning desire for one another
Hey Mat, how‚Äôs it going? You could also call these episodes Couch Corner. Welcome to another episode of Couch Corner. Also, how‚Äôs Oliver doing?
(ME): Hears the new fnaf game release date is gettinng closer,
Instantly types in game theory on computer,
instead finds 'MatPat Talk Time'.
(ALSO ME): Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hey cheif aren't you like, a Transphobe? I mean correct me if I'm wrong but that's a pretty cancelable thing.
When I heard Smike...
Nostalgia trip happened.
Thx for reminding me of him MatPat.
This is officially a new low. MattPatt featured a couch in his video without permission from the couch company.
When I saw the title I thought that it would be about article 13/15/17
"Couch Club with MatPat!"  "Couch Connection with MatPat!"  A "Let's Talk with MatPat!"

Also, having been in a similar situation of being blamed (with heavy penalties) for apparent maliciousness when I simply didn't know, I empathize.

Thankee for publishing this!

Smile!  Jesus loves you!
One other option: hire an artist for the channel!
the mention of smike brought up memories I didn't even know I had lmao
Matt makes the best apology videos. He gives reasons and ways to fix the problem, from both angles. He‚Äôs always respectful and reasonable. And CALM. Gotta respect that
To answer your question you should call these "The COUCH Theory!" Not because it's a Theory or because it's about Couches, but because it's on the Theorists channel and on the Couch.
it's sad people assume the worst and jump to conclusions
Yay I did get PISSED üò§ when you did the TRACER Theory.

Its just a ChatPat
Thanks for conversing
But remember that's just a talk... a life talk thanks for watching.
Why were the filthy Frank memes silenced?? ü§îü§îü§îü§î
Call it ChatPat or Couch theory, [with like a new circle that's blue with a couch sticking out of the trophy or something... idk]
Thanks for addressing this issue, it's pretty hard to NOT use fanart, so I'm glad you are explaining how accidents do happen
I like MatChat ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just a chat. A MatChat thanks for listening!‚Äù
18:46 just noticed after watching both videos a second time one of the Eiffel Tower pics has lights on
as an artist, I ALWAYS assume people just don't understand and think they can take my pictures as they like. being level headed to a small creator or other artist takes a lot but I always live by the phrase" you attract more bees with honey than vinegar" and honestly poop happens sometimes you can share work or fans can share work and not get all the tags attached to it. I MIND when it's a huge company or chain which takes my work does minimal editing or makes there work so close to mine and then sells it at something I could never match as an artist( they make dollars to my cents). I'm going through this at the moment and honestly, it's so depressing. if it was youtube its a different battleground I feel. but my approach to youtube is the same as if it was a smaller creator/ artist. I have only just started uploading speed paints to youtube and only do it for the fun of the thing. creation is sometimes the hardest hurdle and then clicking that publish button makes it even worse..  <3 but please keep creating @matpat and remember poop happens
I don't remember who said it, but MatChat was brilliant!

Mat pat: uses image of printer at 12:23

Printer Company: Thats a new low, you should be ashamed...
Meh. My biggest problem with game theory is it isn't about theories anymore. The channel has mainly become about thinking about fiction more realistically instead of uncovering in-universe conspiracies. Its more like Game Logic than Game Theories.
Thanks for taking the time to talk about both the silly and the serious. Some people just like sweeping stuff under the rug, and it warms my heart that you put integrity first.
Don't worry matpat all the fan artist for give you (right guys)
MatPat you're funny, smart and I love you. I subbed
It's like a chat. A quick chat with MatPat.






A MatChat if you will.
Keep doing what you love Matüòç Idc if your videos are just for fun, all it matters is that it's very interesting to watch.^^
Thank you MatPat.
Videos like this, information getting out--everything you talked about has always been a reason why I'm terrified to draw fanart. I have never drawn fanart in my life just for fear of it getting stolen, or getting ridicule for what ive wanted to draw--to interpret the character correctly or whatever.
This might take me out of my shell to draw fanart. Maybe then I could make content for conventions that people like me would be super excited to buy üòä and I could show love for characters that have had a huge impact in my life.
Thank you for this video! ‚ù§
6:46
Wow, obfuscating the display on the right side of the screen.  You're incredibly disingenuous about your "honest mistakes."
Aww poor matpat. I feel like, he tries to think of thinks logically and sort out situations civilly. You need a head pat mat don‚Äôt beat yourself up over this. Anyone can make mistakes.
Mat pat: *Breaths*


Haters: you monster, that‚Äôs a new low


Edit: love you Mat, hope you don‚Äôt get stressed over this
I will give you Fan Art.
When you are this popular, 'hate' is inevitable, however some of the  controversies are just some of the most minor, pitiable things that I could see people complaining about.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea of fan-art is to produce free content for the media/franchise/individual, so why are these ducking 'artist' trying to validate their work as 'credit-free' when its supposed to be a FAN art? Not saying you can't, but don't make fan pieces without expecting it to fail if you're trying to use it for promotional purposes. 


Also, the self privileged sus-lords, who's complaining for the artists without their opinion is the most sad thing here.
This really puts things into perspective. I've been annoyed at Mat a few times and other people for these reasons without really realising how easy it is to make mistakes and how hard it can be to find them and credit the original creators, if it's even possible.

Also, at first I thought Mat was just trying to play the victim card, but I was quickly convinced that he really is being genuine and honest, and I think that says a lot about Mat as a person, because I've always been kinda on the fence about Matpat, but these videos really do help change that negative image.
MatPat meta is scary and .. definetly a moustache twirling villain -.-
I appreciate how consistently you take serious consideration into all these issues. You're trying your best and your whole team works hard. Love you guys
Wait no team** you used a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night with the lights no 




**I dunno
me: Man ima have some good dreams tonight
My TV: 0:58 
me: NOPE
Very well said!! Best of luck with all the fanart things going forward!
MATTPATT THANK YOU!!!!!!! I didn't know I could look for images like this online. I thought I would need to register for a stock photo service or have to keep trying to find elusive royalty free photos the old fashioned way. This is God send for me man. Thank you SOOOOO much for mentioning that. It's going to save me a lot of grief in the future.

People really do have to stop getting so mad at a THEORY...jeez
Thank you so much for your transparency, I love seeing the behind-the-scenes of your videos, it makes everything feel much more human
If you have to give credit for using fan art then the artist needs to give credit to the creator of whatever it is they're drawing.
Very cool you are bringing this up. Currently learning about how web pages work and about image and all that kind of techniques and the class even went over on how to use different sources of stock photographs properly.
When MatPat sits on the couch, you know stuffs about to go down.
The root of all of this is that these are Tumblr artists with persecution complexes. They don't actually care about the art or the artists, they simply need to feel superior.
MatPat, don't listen to the people that hate. They just don't see what we theorists see. A lot of us support you and love what you do. But hey, in the end I'm just a YouTuber with 13 subs. :/
Dear MatPat,
It's okay, I'll make some just for you to use, won't be a Mona Lisa but if you give me some guidelines, I can have a couple of small pics... I'll give you the rights to use them as you see fit. 
PS: can only do freehand drawing
Do a video calculating how fast of a speedrun there can be on whatever gane you'd like. I'd prefer the original Super Mario Bros
matpat:*exist*
article 13:im about the end this mans career
Matpat it's okay your doing just fine üíï
But watermarking own artworks is so subjective for artists. I, for one, prefer NOT putting watermark on my own art because 1) It looks weird and seem to muddy my work. 2) I feel like my username is subject to change and/or I think my signature is ugly. 

So the last tip will probably still be up for debate, maybe forever.
people are like "MatChat" or "Chatpat"
combine those two: "ChatChat"
How about: "GTLecture" ?

...then again, maybe not.
Petition to leave Mat and Steph alone for once because they've dealt with enough crap from petty nerds already
I‚Äôve been watching your content for years since I was in high school but the channel seems to be going on a slope. You seem to be very tensed and worried. If there‚Äôs anything wrong, please go get help before you get stuck into this hole of self pitty.
you should call this segmant the ChatPat
Thank you for posting this. I know it‚Äôs scary sometimes, but you always provide concise, illustrative, well-worded explanations for various issues related to YouTube, gaming, and copyright problems you discover. As someone who might try to become a creator myself one day, I appreciate them a lot. Keep doing what you do üëç
If you make it public I guess this is what you risk...
Matpat: I encourage fanart.

Lmao
I agree with the people who said MatChat, good name.
Chitchat with MatPat: 
Thanks for Understanding
nobody:


Matpat: Made an honest mistake
Fan: 
Also anyone remember fnaf dayshift "Thank"
I like your cat bookshelf holder, I have a moose one that I keep my widdling knife on.
when ever you make a serious or semi-serious video on the couch you should bring Peepachu in.
8:59
dankest of dank memes
where can I get these
Fan art: *is so freaking similar to the original without any watermark, signature, or indicator fan art whatsoever
MatPat: *mistakenly perceived the fan art as original
Some gremlin: REEEEEEEEEEEEE
Dude if you used my Art work on a video I would start screeching like a little girl!
Very rarely do I hesitate to click that like button on a Game Theorist video...





Just kidding, I hit that button before the video even loads.
MatPat I'm so glad you posted this video. You're totally right about this issue. People get so mad about you using their fan art, when they don't even try to protect it. You're a human like everyone else, so I can see why you would make that mistake. Also, thanks for the tips on protecting your art. Being an artist, I'm glad to have some tips on protecting my fan art/art. No one else on YouTube really addresses this. I hope this issue doesn't bother you to much later!
"Couch theory", obviously. :-)
Idk why everyone hates game theory. The theories are just for fun and I support matpat 100%
Artist: Makes fan art
Also the artist: Doesn‚Äôt watermark
Some guy: Uses image unintentionally
Artist: Wait, that‚Äôs illegal
Lmao I saw this guy at my work, hes a really good guy
A Chat with Matt. or <insert word here> (e.g. Theory, Real Talk, Real Time) with Matt. or The Correction Couch
Probably the best idea is name the segment based on it's subject matter.
Sincere thoughts, with Matpat. Good name?
Mat Pat: Blinks



Haters: 
"That's just a talk. A COUCH TALK!" is a perfect way to sign off on these types of videos.

Thank you for your transparency and honesty in what you do for your channels, and your viewers and fandom. You make NE Ohio proud.
SINGLE WATERMARK...but those can even be photoshopped out...I suggest patterned watermarks (full page pattern).

However, I do know as an artist it takes away from the overall effect of the artwork.
‚ÄúLuigi‚Äôs hoo-ha‚Äù words of wisdom from the smartest show of gaming- words of   2019
Hey mat you‚Äôre the greatest you tuber ever
The problem: 
Scott Cawthon keeps releasing God damn FNAF games
I do really like these MatChat Videos they‚Äôre always a nice break from the Loud and outgoing vids on this site. I love those too but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to just sit back and get serious
Hey MatPat guess what we all love you and I understand that you messed up but it happens no one is perfect so it's ok to be wrong and I'm so glad you did this I love you your videos and your theories you've helped me so much so thank you so muchüíïüíïüíï
OH MY GOODNESS. I KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD NAME THIS SERIES... CHAT PAT MAT CHAT. xD
Great advice for all artists digital or otherwise, fan art or fine art! Sign your work and use a water mark!!!
someone: makes fanart without denoting in any way that its actually fanart
matpat: looks legit
literally everyone: IS THAT SOME KIND OF PERSONAL ATTACK
The one that got me kinda confused on how samurai where the strongest warrior but the video was atleast good but kinda historically incorrect
Couch Conversations (with Matpat)
Does MatPat have a podcast? I feel like he could produce an really good podcast, something I would definitely listen to.
Couch Convo's w/ Matpat 
Thank you to you and your team for creating wholesome content and for being an awesome mediator between us viewers and content makers in the Youtube community!
Take care and until next time..!
Let's be real here: MatPat made a mistake and could've just apologized... But instead he apologizes, explains it and puts it into perspective, AND give tips on how to improve so this doesn't happen in the future! Damn, I wish all apologies were done this way! :P
Good job MatPat, the internet at large can learn a thing or two from your approach to controversy!
I thought there was something wrong with my eyes at first... Mat's face is blinding
Hey mat, curious question
In smash ultimate one of child links taunts has him pulling out a bottle of lonlon milk with such force that the cork flies out
How much force, did link apply to said bottle to make the cork fly out? Just curious
Since that kinda...defies how things work lol
Oops

I watched things you have missed and he said sister location and fanf 4 was due at the same time the code that made the cameras show fanf 4 that I the cameras were LIVE.
That Critical Role drawing from WendyDoodles hit hard.

Just sayin. 

Not cool.
16:30 
Lol Being gay isn‚Äôt a choice....






It‚Äôs something JK Rowling assigns to you.
So is your name Matthew Patrick?
Just a theory...
WOO, Wendy Doodles!! 


!D-N-D, D-N-D!
"It's just a chat!
A MatPat Chat!"
XD
I have to admit, though. This video and the other FNAF video you released alongside this one are very enlightening to me as an artist and sometimes fanartist. So thanks Mat!
You're good Matt just keep doing your best we know that you try to do what's best
Outro:
And remember, that's just a chat... 
A MatChat
oh my god you called yourself out for the persona video. kudos for admitting that low haha
Lol y does matpat look different in the thumbnail? Just me? Ok...
Your videos on the theory videos also teach skills people use in school.  Thank you for that you have helped me so much to pass so many classes.
Well I didn‚Äôt even know that you were using fan art
Don't understand the hate people have for MatPat. In a Discord server I was in, when a new theory video about Deltarune got released everyone got mad at him and said "ugh, it's matpat again." Why do his theories affect you so much? What's the problem with him looking at a game from a different perspective? Stop being such a self-centered jerk and appreciate the man for what he is.

Love your videos Mat, keep it up.
Oh man I remember getting so excited when seeing a wallpaper i had made in someone‚Äôs video the feeling of ‚Äòit was so good they chose to use my art‚Äô

Now I‚Äôm off to read about these multiple babies you‚Äôve adopted üòÇ
This guy is moaning all the time
Here's an idea:

Matt's couch
If I did more drawing, and some of it got used in a video like this, or got mistaken for original work or something like that, I would be so happy, and would just message and say thank you.
Hey Mat
Call your couch videos
Mat Chats (or Pat Chats)
"Take a seat, it's SatPat time!"

Cause he's sitting.
Hmmm a lot of people use my fan arts with out crediting me, and you know what, when i see it on videos i get happy and tell them Thank you for using my art.
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT! if you‚Äôd have played UCN ( ultimate custom night ) if you see in the back it looks like the lines in the background of the teaser
so he removes images from other video that are fan art and proceeds to put them in his new video
LOGIC 100
but its good he is addressing this
Matpat: my theories are not meant to be taken seriously.

Viewers: am I a joke to you?

Edit: everyone finna correct me on spelling like that tho üò•
Existing, existing is your problem. ;)
Mat: Talks about fan art issues
Also Mat: Shows fan art
How about Couch Chat with Mat Pat
You've tried mat, we all make mistakes. Don't beat your self up about make a simple mistake, you've done what you can !
For a name how bout 


Matpat's Couch Chat  ,
 ,
Or something along those lines


Maybe like this so Mat can see?

Edit, someone said to watermark this and I thought that was funny so this is the best I can do xD ‚Ñ¢¬©
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GT
HAPPY BITHDAY GAME I PROBABLY ERALY
HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAAAAAY GT
YEAH
Matt. Thank you. I didnt think of the problems these people brought up. And you saw them. You saw their anger and wanted to offer a explanation as to why you would never do such a thing. You never had to. But you did. Thank you. Keep being awesome.
Today's episode is brought to you by Hanlon's Razor
"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence."
Even if "Incompetence" sounds very harsh in this regard.
‚ÄúTheory: a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained‚Äù these are all POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS. Not actual FACTS!
And that‚Äôs just a theory,





A normal theory,





Thanks for liking
I do a lot of fan art because I love anime and manga, and I'm so happy that MatPat did this because a lot of people don't get credited for their art. Even though you'll never see this, thank you MatPat.
Watch youngyong tales newest video
He wants to do a collab(pls do)
You should brand it as ‚ÄúSharing With MatPat‚Äù üòÇ
Y'all are some twisted panty artists if you get butthurt for someone with an actual audience to see their art
Mat: Does thing
Twitter: How dare he? This is a new low for not only him, but all of humanity!
Ok, this is silly. I wish I would draw a very very slightly modified version of SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK and get mad when I don't receive credit for it. This is ludicrous.
Couch Conversations with MatPat...Except you're only listening...
Personally i wouldnt mind if someone used my fanart without credit as long as they dont claim its theirs
I almost cried through this by emotions or dry eyes, probably both.
Ok matpat but real talk here...








When are we getting a Mario Party theory?
Man, I hope these people who are bashing you for every little unintentional, good-natured slip up never make a mistake themselves. Karma's gonna get them.
And remember that's just a talk a Theory talk thanks for watching
ah so it finally comes to the surface...i always wondered where most of those pictures of interesting things came from ...
AnD REMEMBER! That's jUst a couch talk! A stoRy couch time talk thingy! Thanks for watching!
Honestly, you‚Äôre one of the more genuine people I watch on YouTube.
I hope you‚Äôre doing alright man, I understand how things like this can weigh on a person.

Thank you for addressing things though, I hope it helps things
You're doing great, Mat
Keep it up!
That's why I never even took Albert Einstein theories seriously..................Kappa
one day there going to start demonetizing you for playing copyrighted games.
I vote chatpat for these talks btw ü§£
Interesting fact.
  A Mother 3 sprite(which was fan art) accidentally got in Super Smash Bros Ultimate as a spirit and they had to replace it. Even big company's make this mistake.
19:23 "it's like a collab with myself" is the best part of this entire video üòÇ
Don‚Äôt take it seriously it‚Äôs just a theory 
(Should have put that in the beginning)
Can we talk about how he missed the opportunity to call it "ChatPat"?
Rarely-seen honesty and humility from a YouTuber. Very much appreciated, MP
I've always thought of Matpat as someone who really tries his best with this sort of thing. Keep it up, man, you and your team are doing great!
STOP THE VIDEO, GRANNY MARBLESSS
Love this video so much! Also, the guy who tweeted about Kirby Star Allies got upset that Matt featured his tweet in this video and ‚Äúsent his fans after him‚Äù
12:47 theory confirmed: matpat is an uber.
You're such a standup guy Matpat. <3
"I'm the middle aged Dad of YouTube!"
~MatPat 2019, in a video about fanart
Can you do a theory? On sims 4 strangerville??
I am listening.. I did watch your collab with yourself. CouchTalk
It's an honest mistake! I don't see how people can get so mad and accusatory about it!
I think those three steps are very important for fan-artists to follow!!
why do we get so mad about mistakes after all we are humans we make mistakes and good god it's just miss labeled fan art not a nuclear bomb
This really shows how mistakes are so easy to make and many people just don't understand. Good job Matt keep going love your videos.
And remember, that's just a here-y... a LISTEN HERE-Y!
Does any one feel that Matpat looks and sounds like he is about to cry üòÜ
Hey MatPat you should make a video deciphering the splatoon inkling language
Even if you were to sit in front of a mic, i'd still watch your videos. If you use less images and have some image cuts and the rest was just you, I'd still be happy!
Game Theory: [makes an oopsie]


Game Developers: Am I a joke to you?
Honestly, I want you to use fanart that I make if I make it. That would be DOPE!!!! Thing is I uh... cough cough can't draw. (but I can a little, I'm learning now! yay!)
FaceTime with MatPat, wait apple owns that....uhhhh All up in my business time, lol, Pat-splaining?
We need to make "this is a new low" a meme xD
The end killed me! ü§£üëåüò≠
Okay I understand crediting artists because I was an artist at one point but you can‚Äôt get mad at people for using your image on accident if you:
1. don‚Äôt have a watermark or tag
2. practically traced a majority of the picture.
3. photoshopped your art onto an official design from the originator.
Really!?! Oh come on people grow up and stop whining about people like matpat using your fan art and not giving credit leave the poor guy alone!!!!!!!
squints at MatPat's neck.....








I just noticed that MatPat has chest hair
Definitely keep making these matt I'm loving them. Also everyone clearly loves Matchat that's obvious. Also I think "thanks for conversing" at the end would be cool or maybe thanks for talking?
Not anymore in Europe with article 13 üò¢
Artist: basically copies someone‚Äôs work to the point where the original artist has trouble distinguishing

Matpat: uses art work for a second

Artist: WHAT MY- MY ART MY ORIGINAL 100% MINE ART WHAAAAAT?!
I nominate these talks as MatChats. That's just a chat, A MATCHAT! Thanks for talking!
CHAT-PAT!!!!!
You continue to be an inspiration sir! I tip my hat to you :)
DUDE!!! IT'S A MATT CHAT!!!!
A high level of success comes with a high level of scrutiny. It's interesting to see popular Youtube creators deal with these issues. Great video as always MatPat. üëç
That‚Äôs just a convo..
A COUCH CONVO
thanks for watching.
pause the video on 6:47 mats face is gold
I say continue with your theories. Sharing ideas with the world everlasting life,  others might have a better understanding.
Remember! This's not a theories, it's YOU chat with me ( MATPAT ) . . . . Thanks for watching.

MATCHAT ( Top comment ) is sound very attached. good one.
Could have called it "Matt Chats".... missed opportunity :)
CALL IT THE "MATT CHAT"üòç BRILLIANT IDEA, PLEASE
I'm shocked by how attractive I find him now, like he's grown up.
Sometime his voice squeaks into classic GameTheory, it's like a refreshing reminder.
It's actually been YEARS since I watched this channel, I'd actually totally forgotten about him, I clicked on this video thinking it was about actual Game Theory, lol!
My brother has a sign that he puts on all his artwork fan art and not.it isn't a signature but a symbol. You can't really find a original of something because of reports which also makes it hard to find actual screenshots of a game because 
There is so much fan art.
Me personally I don't really care for the topic of the video but I really find this types of videos very enjoyable please continue this series
You know it‚Äôs a serious video when he‚Äôs sitting on his couch...
I have an idea:
Talk down
Chatpat
Matpat's sounds like my friggin parents giving me a life lesson
"MATPATS CHATS"
I've been binging the crap out of your channel for the last week or 2 and finally got to this one. You are one of the most honest, legit, producers on YouTube. You will never see this comment but I feel for your genuine concern over your product and the environment you find yourself. Keep up your growth and keep the theories coming i love all your vids (even the miscalculations)
Fortnite: Steals  Ideas
Everyone: ok


MatPat: 
Everyone" WTF!!

Basically that's how life works
These videos are awesome, sometimes I forget that you're a human
I thank you for going over this and it is important for the fans to know u care
Mat is the Ideal person who can really show appreciation to anything or anyone, even if it's not noticable, this is why I respect him.
World change very fast
Seriously MatPat, how do you handle the stress and pressure? I could really use a couch talk on that. Huge fan!
"Lets Chat with Matpat". Should be the title for these videos and it rolls off of the tounge
Your biggest problem is that you either lost the motivation or creativity to run this channel, own up to your mistakes and go forward
We need more human beings like this person. He'd make a good boss... or President!
Good thing article 13 was passed.
Matpat: accidentally uses extremely real legit fan art 

Artist: I‚Äôm about to end this man‚Äôs whole career

*Love yo matpat, keep up the great work and helping people know important topics
Honestly the kindest soul ever (‡πë‚ïπœâ‚ïπ‡πë )
Obligatory Family Guy "Oh my god who the hell cares."
I would honesty be honoured if any person would use my music or artwork.
I've gained a new respect for you. Thanks for addressing this, I completely understand how these errors are made and how you're trying to improve them
I think game theory (and its sub channels) is going through kind of a depression... seeing more serious issues and being put under a lot of stressful and sad situations... so i wanted to say that it always gets worse before it gets better. So tough it out and eventually it‚Äôll be great again.
Heh. Heh.
 Heh. Heh.
  Heh. Heh.
Well now, I should've just made coffee.
My friends always take your seriously, and I tell them its not f*cking legit and they are speculations connected by coincidences or easter eggs left by game devs. Thanks for making this video.
It sucks that Matt had to make these videos, all Matt needed to do was put the reference of the original artist instead of defend his position from cancerous "fans" of the show smh
Some people are going to get outraged about anything they can possibly find. Unfortunately, outrage culture has some unfortunate influence on creators such as yourself.
>plenty of youtubers milk a franchise to death
>shows GT fnaf playlist
PatChat includes the option of Stephanie joining too :)
"And that is just a realchat with matpat, thanks for watching."
Easily one of my favourite recent GT videos.
Wait, wasn't that guy on twitter a bit overreacting? Dude, chill out, wherever you are.
I appreciate MatPat‚Äôs perspective and attitude about everything, and how he has proven over and over that he has everyone‚Äôs best interest in mind. It hurts to see people get mad at him for simple accidental mistakes. Keep going MatPat, thank you for this honesty!
I mean if you make a model of a character as close to the original as possible when the original character design doesn't belong to you, you honestly don't deserve the credit
Do a game theory on Fortnite removing health and materials per kill
It's ok! Everyone makes mistakes ‚ù§
Mat Pat's couch videos are now my favorite videos
Message of the Video: I'm human and sometimes I goof, stop hating.
I think it‚Äôs important that when something is called out and noticed it‚Äôs not swept under the rug, the mistake is fixed or at least credited as quickly and accurately as possible. I appreciate this video and your discussions on this topic.
MatPat who's Austin I've been seeing his theories instead of your theories on your channel lately
Mat Pat sits on the couch
Me:Welp this is going to be serious.....
I was hoping for another April fools video
Makes convincing fan art. "How dare you mistake my fan art for being real!"

Adm Ackbar: ITS A TRAP!
Your biggest problem is not properly distinguishing between hypotheses and theories.
3 mins in Oh crap this video's content does effect me directly. Whoops for assuming it doesn't. My bad! ..evenifnooneveryusesmyfanmadecontent.
lol
#Ihaventbeenrelevantforyears
Also feel free to use this meme image if for some reason anyone here on gametheory ever tackles the game subjects of Warframe, as i had whipped it together for a memes contest on the official warframe forums a while back.
'Dunce Cap' with MATPAT
i love wathing matt looking at my soul :I
It will never cease to amaze me how seriously people take Game Theory and get very worked up about it.
This is so sad oh my God üòî
youl always be my faverit youtuber matpat no matter what happens
How on earth can someone make fanart so convincing that it is impossible to tell it apart from original work without extensive research and or analysis, and not have 110% of responsibility for it beaing treated as that original work on their head?
Matpat there‚Äôs a legendary thing that will let you check the Kirby box arts and it called the Kirby Wiki
You could call these Matt Chats. But yeah I've literally never heard about this issue but you explained your side of things very well.
Hey Mat, long time fan... you keep coming with great stuff. I personally thank you for always being transparent with things like this. People criticize and they always will. They jump the gun and say things without knowing the whole story thats just how it is. You keep doing what you guys do best and thanks for the great content.
Can you just admit that Vikings vs samurai vs knights was super incorrect and flawed so I can stop rioting
And that's just a talk, A COUCH TALK! THNX FOR LISTENING!
"it's like a colab with myself" I don't know why that's got me laughing so hard, but it does
I wonder how uncomfortable Mat still gets with these couch videos. Are they getting more normal?
call them something different every time just to mess with people
thanks for addersing this matpat you are really nice
And remember thats just a chat a matchat, thanks for watching
Knowing you the fanf theories definitely matter
Soon MatPat is gonna make a new channel with a blue logo and a couch in the centre called The Life Theorists
Another important advice for copyright owners alongside everything you said:
Please don't try to make a big deal out of someone using your work, without even trying to contact them. And even if they don't respond after contacting them, don't assume automatically that it HAS to be intended and the person just outright doesn't want to credit you. 99% of the time this is not the case, but it's just hard as a person with a huge following to pick out a single message from you.
Give them a chance to recognize their mistake and try your best to appreciate that the person seemed to really like your work to even use it in their work.
Matpat put all his skill points into, Charisma and Intelligence.
I love you. The Sky is Blue.
Thank you for always talking about things that matter. A big swig of diet coke for the working man.
If matpat steals my fanart for gametheory
I would cry










Edit:199 likes and 36 replys?!? This is the kost likes/replys ive ever gotten! Thx alot guys!
I remember the Smike tragedy. THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO?!!!
I get that this video is meant to be super serious, but can I just say that Mat, your teeth are AMAZING. All so even and so white lol. Anyway let's get back to seriousness, but try watching the video without picking up on the beauty of his teeth. üòÅ
Lmao remember when legal Eagle tried to say you copied him
I absolutely love your channel, and idk why ppl r mad at u for mistakes that can easily be made. Why don‚Äôt they try to do what u do and watch them make the same mistakes.
And this is why matpat is a personal fav. He always clears up a problem with respect and after reading such a hateful comment he gives a respectful and kind response. We love you matpat! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Totally late but, what about MatPat takes the Mic? Though I know you and Steph hate alteration so.... But it's there if you want it
Meow. I agree with you.
I don't think these need a name. It's kind of charming that at the end you're just very authentic/candid about the intimate nature of them, and you're just like "THAT'S... JUST WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THX 4 WATCHING."
Out of all the topics this could've been about, this was not even on my mind. I guess it's a whole world of fan artists out there I didn't know about.
Actually, dropping two completely different videos at the same time is smart.
So people can chose to watch a more serious video or listen to MatPat descend into madness about fnaf





Or watch both like I am
Enjoying thoughtful MatPat video
Spots WendyDoodles
Hold up, is the CRITICAL ROLE??


WHO IS THE CRITTER ON THE GAME THEORY CREW?? THERE MUST BE ONE OF YOU!!
Idk who drew this profile picture of the Zombie girl...but I would love to know.
I Just use it because it's cute.
BUT HEY, That's just a rant, A MADPAT-RANT (pun intended)
lol it wasn't until 8 mins in that I realized the channel was called the game theorists. I thought this was a video talking about game theory
Can't wait for people to start claiming this is dishonest or "he's just deflecting" or some other load of tripe. Mat's made mistakes, sure, but this is him genuinely trying to sort out a problem and own up to it. He's just explaining how it happened. Mat's a good guy, folks!
I swear iI thought this was gonna be an update on article 13.  but i really like when we have theese honest moments,
There is a problem with the fanf time line I Watched the things you miss
You should cover up peoples twitter @s and stuff to avoid them being attacked
Well done man! Well done. Huge props to you.
He protecc 
He attacc 
But most importantly 
He always bring the couch bacc
Or sometimes I just wanna know what people think about said particular ingame mystery
What about Simulacra that's a Good game and you didn't do anything about it..... 
And I have a idea, who's the killer... 
Please do it! 
Thanks!
honestly i like the old polygon-ish animations, like from the minecraft and zelda hookshot episode?
The Game Theorists channel has a problem .... BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY!  Just a theory...
Outrage culture. It'll get ya. No one asks questions anymore, they just react.
And remember it's just a Talk.... A Real Talk... Couch Talk? Mat Talk? Uhh we might have a problem with naming this one Mat. Back to the sketch board...
Conclusion: always check the source.
Your biggest problem is you complain to much, and you're a snowflake
Oh yeah and couch time should be PATCHAT
Whenever I see some controversy pop up with your name in the title, I'm suspicious from the get go. I've been watching you for a couple of years now (around 2015, I think), I've seen a lot of your videos, A LOT of your streams, and if there is one thing I learned about you and Steph and the crew, is that you're all genuinely good people. You're not mean, you don't exploit us for anything, you take us into consideration when making some decisions (for example, when everyone started using the youtube membership thing, you asked us if we wanted to have that on the channel.), you make quality videos with loads of research and effort put into it, as well as making sure the merch you make is quality as well. Stuff like "matpat steals fanarts" or "matpat isn't citing any work" is an over the top mess people try to pin on you when they don't know the whole story. If there's someting wrong, you fix it and appologize for it (which I feel like you don't need to do half the time because the people who watch you are smart and understanding and the people who go berserk on you for every little thing that goes wrong should go to h-e- double toothpicks üò°). You are great, your team is great, your videos are great, mistakes happen and that's normal, as you said, we're all human and mistakes happen for crying out loud üòß. I think I've rambled on quite enough. Thanks to anyone who read this this far, here's a gold star üåüand have a nice day/night üòä
ƒ∞ think the biggest problem is article 13
I can't believe he acknowledged he's milking FNAF XD
If every pork chop where perfect we wouldn't have hotdogs!
tl:dr all comments.   how bout "its a MatPat, CouchChat" (or even MP:CC) if a repeat (of other other oc) sorry! (again comments tl:dr)
PLEASE call these "MatPat's ChitChats" or some iteration of that. There's nothing like a good rhyming title.
Damnit Triman you hurt Matpat's feelings.
Article 13 is gonna get knocked down. Probably.
Just keep what you are doing. You will always get a like from me.
That hairstyle was a choice ! =p love ya
MatPat: Features Fanart that looks so good he reasonably thinks it's canon.
Twitter Dude: You scum‚Ä¶ how could you?
Everyone Else: :/
Mat Pat Talk Time

Insert Music
These ChatPat meetings always make me worried. He always sounds like he's about to cry.
lmaooooo smiiiike i forgot about that guy üò≥üò≥
Y3eeeet more uploads, thx matpat
I've literally spent days trying to track down original artists some times.
It sucks people think you just yoink pictures to make money
Once i found my fanart on imugur and i was suprised but not upset
When you showed the fake Bonnie model I immediately knew that it was a fan model.
The only one I still hate is the Knight the Viking and the Samurai
How does this fit into the fnaf lore?
I'm really surprised you didnt jump on the opportunity to call these realtalk vids "ChatPat"
MatPat, I like you.  I think your videos are really swell. Thank you for all you do.
I would avoid "Story Time". It's a type of kink where you get women to read erotica to a group of men. Why do I know this? The practice was banned on my college campus.
Wait...... He reads Wattpad?!??  I need to know ow his account and follow him
Dude your jaw looks so freakin strong
Matpat always gets slandered, but you have to respect the guy.
Kinda liking ‚ÄúCouch time‚Äù with Matpat. Really interesting to learn backstory and behind the scenes. Thanks for keeping it real!
This is a great apology/explanation
Since they could be about either show, what about Screenside Chats?
Your videos, always entertainment
Even Nintendo is guilty of this. The Masked Man spirit they used in Smash Bros. Ultimate actually used to be a fanmade sprite.
You're good dude bud. Keep up the work.
Idk why but each time I hear fan art I just think of furries (in my opinion I actually kinda despise furries but it‚Äôs my opinion)
So is the problem this has is that the videos just pan out for awhile to get ad revenue.
And that‚Äôs NOT just a theory~ (And then whatever you name it. Maybe something inspired by the scientific method, since the other videos are theories and this is more? Whatever works my man)
"I'm only human." is something that should be said more nowadays, and surely understood. We're all human.
You know... I think MatPat would look good with a mustache to twirl...
I thought this was about article 13
That's just a couch. A CONFESSION COUCH. Also fan art rights and public domain are small obsessions of mine, so you can never talk about these things enough.
Literal sea of tens of thousands of images?
You know it's a serious video when MatPat has his face in the thumbnail

Except in GT Live and in some videos
I suppose each and every publisher needs to sift through thousands of uncredited images with a microscope to verify who precisely made them despite the fact that said images are not only barely transformative in themselves, and will also only be featured for a few moments out of a 20 minute long video. 

Get real people this is ridiculous...
A Sad State of Affairs. ... I'm lucky that I'm Rich.
GLAD YOU POSTED THIS ON MARCH 31ST AND NOT ON APRIL 1ST
Hell, let's take this another way. Your videos are your own artistic expression. Therefore your inclusion of other people's fanart, is just your own fanart of their fanart. Derp.
As a fanartist myself I would be honored if you used my art (even if it's not credited) because I understand how easy it is to make mistakes like this (and also because you noticed me).
Welcome to the Casting Couch with MatPat
Honestly if fan art is made so well that it looks legit, then I don't care if you steal it.  If anything, it's a compliment to the artist on how well they made it
If i make a mistake I rarly care about the Ramifications. Frankly I disagree with some ome of the Outrage that Youtube and the internet at large has directed at people. Some people you all have raged at recently.
I think something a long the lines, if you're going to use the game theory ending, use something like: It's just a chat, a Matt/Patchat. Thanks for listening!

Only reason I say listening instead of watching is that people can sometimes feel that watching is passive, while listening is active (why I will never know, I'm going to assume it's the difference between hearing something and listening?). Gives it that lil bit of compassionate encouragement to talk about it more
"Theoretically Speaking" would make a great title for this style of Game Theory videos.
Like everyone is saying MATCHAT
Everyone just needs to stop crying. I see nothing wrong with this. He's only using fan art
Sans is Nes by the way
yes mat that what I took from your videos is just a good story with some education about my favorite games and movies in ludington your other chanel
This is why I respect MatPat so much. He genuinely cares about his audience and his work. He addresses issues that need to be addressed. Game Theory was the first channel I subscribed to, and it's still one of my favorites.
dont feel bad, fan art is like a new scooby doo series that comes out every decade, theres nothing original about, expect fan art isnt even on the same level
I've got one : Theory Couch Chats
These people are dumb. If mat pat uses ur fanart u should be proud
1:09 i can tell that one was hard to spit out and pretty akward.
Game Theory has a problem.

But that's just a theory. A GAME THEORY!
he mentioned For Honor... props
Since i‚Äôm a starter fan-art maker I technically have nothing to fear for now. Only problem is That DeviantArt is FUUULLLLL of fan-art thus also loads of people stealing our art. It‚Äôs quite impossible to stop art theft.
(Also, profile picture was not Made by me)
Thank you so much for this warning matpat!  Do you have any sources for fanartists/artists to post their work with good copyright regulation?
I'm glad I don't hang in those circles. My brain would explode if I heard people correcting me at that level for "fan art". I would imagine those people are in the same circles that enjoy furry porn.
The Real Problem Of Game Theory.
You Release 2 Videos At The Same Time So Your 20 Minutes Late To One Of Them
How do I send fan art to you
Couch talk sounds okay for me
Granny marbles üòÇüòÇ
WAIT A SECOND... THAT KIRBY BOX COVER IS FAN ART?!?!... how did anyone expected you to know that, that's just... i can't swear , so i'll say... that's just evil, absurd, downright lacking any common sense
"But hey, that's just some sense... some COMMON SENSE! Thanks for Watching." Somehow my brain immediately said this as the video ended.


My other thought is "But hey, that's just a conversation... a Couch Convo. Thanks for Watching."
You should call these episodes MatChat time.
I remember Smike, I just entirely forgot him. Even the songs are now almost fresh in my mind.
Matt's brats 
Lmao got me dead
MatPat you need to look into the mystery of 6 figure temps in website GTA 5. Many people are itching for a lead into how to solve this mystery.
I love how people still rag on Matpat and Game Theory for being human and making mistakes. Yes, even here this is clearly rehearsed, possibly scripted, yet he‚Äôs still real. The people in the crew I‚Äôm sure are just as real. Keep it up man
gosh thanks for the effort!
He‚Äôs right these couch episodes are INTENSE
I like couch theory
If I may pitch a title, "Couch Chat with MatPat".  Short, sweet, and to the point.
Mat: The unbelievable amount of children I have Adopted in those stories

Me: Everyone wants to be adopted by Mathew!
Well matt in reply to your first comment. You are "The Game Theorists" not "The Game Facts". Those people just need to learn the difference between THEORY and FACT.
Your vids a just like science research, theory upon theory until the fact/truth is sometimes found. Very convincing theories at that.
I hope none of those people try to go major in Science Research, their in for a world of butt hurt.
Love your vids, keep up the good work.
PS:  Flipping hilarious! I Love it when you slip in one of those.
who cares if youre using it in a transformative manner
Why are people messing with Mat, with the Theorists, and with everyone nowadays? For Christ's sake, people. Get. A. Life. If he, or his team, made a mistake, that's what it is, a MISTAKE. Yeah, call it out to him, let the GT's know that they should credit it. But don't make it look like a villanous act. That's straight up comic book logic you're working on there. -


Love to ya MatPat, your videos are awesome!
The most iconic asset in game theory is that one dude who‚Äôs crossing his arms
People that make fan art: omg my arts in game theory
People who hate game theory: oh lord I have a reason to get angery.
I'm more worried about that dead cat behind him used to hold books.
BUT HEY, THAT'S JUST MY COUCH TALK!
Lol sorry for accidentally stealing art, here is how you can fix it. Just kidding around tho ;)
captions on at 10:22
My default setting is "benefit of the doubt". 
It's a shame not everybody does the same.
10:30 I REMEMBER THAT EXACT VIDEO!!! I WATCHED IT!!!
Nothing is safe. Sorry you had to apologize. Keep up the good work.
Why does he sounds like he is about to cry?
The people who disliked LOVE hating for no reason
I‚Äôve gotta say the person who tweeted at him was pretty rude. Just the aggressive nature of it was kinda off putting for what I would call a minor slip up that could have been addressed in a much more sophisticated manner.
Wait...I thought Tumblr was the darker recesses of the internet.
WELCOME TO COUCH THERAPY!!!!
So if we live, God will sue us?






no I‚Äôm kidding don‚Äôt kill urself please
Your biggest problem, Mat, is that you have too many problems.
MatPat is honestly one of the most transparent and honest Youtubers out there. If he makes a mistake, he is the first one to point it out. Haters gonna hate, keep up the amazing content Mat!
Idea for what to call these: MatChats
I smell a new channel...... FAN THEORY!!!!!!
9:36 Critical Role fanart.   =3
You have a good heart. üíö
Dang. See. This is what I like about big name YouTubers. When they confront big problems that could effect how people view their channels. When YouTubers personally apologize about these problems makes people realize that even the best of us can make mistakes, and owe up to it
"We take this very seriously"
Reaaaaaaaaally????? thinks of the fnaf 7 theory and matpat is in freddy pajama 0h yea ...
I always watched for the cool proof to someyhing I would‚Äôve never believed or thought of
See I'm a artist myself(mainly draw animals) and I'd be one of the people that would love for my art to be shown in a video :p I feel it shows people enjoy my art and I did a good job.
hey, it's okay, you made a mistake and that's fine. The real people to blame are the artists. They are not clearly signing their work. They are baiting people without even knowing it. Artists need to have easy to see clear signatures on their works.
I really like these honest "talks" episode. Obviously it's not why I'm on this channel, but every now and then these things really reminds us that there's a person behind the catchphrase ;) 
Anyways, as an artist, you are always welcome to use anything I upload on my social media :)
i lost it at "granny marbles" LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
good ol' social justice :V
Can you do a film theory on v for vendetta?
How about Mat Fact? :P
Matpat: Fanart is okay


Article 13: Hold my drink
I'm proud of you, Matt. You've done a nice job lately of addressing issues as they arise, and it makes me happy to be part of this community. Yes, there are plenty of problematic things that happen on the channel, but you actively try to do better about them whenever you can.
Man, I LOVE how matpat acts and handles these situations.  People would seriously benefit from doing what he does, and looking at both sides of the equation, and owning up to mistakes, and emphasizing kindness even when things go wrong.
You can't spell "Fan Art" without "Fart".
People who make fan art are basically just stealing and slightly changing the original creation
nobody:
people: commenting without having even watched the whole video
I ALWAYS enjoy your theories Matpat :)

I'm not the smartest, so your insights are insights give me a different viewpoints that I never would have thought about on my own :)

Also Mat, I have firm belief that you put fans first, same as Scott. I trust you.
Ok if you make art and don‚Äôt credit yourself in the image itself then that‚Äôs your fault
I like that Matpat has been uploading these kinds of videos on THIS YouTube channel.
damn you guys can't catch a break üò≠
The fact that he missed the opportunity/pun to call this series MatChat w/ MatPat amazes me. It was staring him in the face lol
Remember it's just a theory
Bonus Matterials?
MATPAT MAKES A CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE @9:37
That may be what's happening, though should that be anything of a reason to continue that?
I remember game theory used my fan art in a fnaf video and I thought it was one of the coolest things ever. He didn't credit me but I didn't care. I think people who didn't even create the artwork get more triggered than the creators themselves.
Moral:Memes and fan art is the same thing in a weird way.
i forgot about smike
I thought this video would be about MatPat being a shill. Oh well.
Fan art is stolen in and of itself it is a derivative work and illegal
Funny how it goes from "Thanks for including my fanart!!!" to "Taste the tines of my pitchfork thief!!"
I want to just say thank you for your hard work overall but also adherence to a simple formula. If I see a new release I'll eventually click it... if I see you on the couch in the image though, I click it immediately, because I know the difference in tonality I'm going to get.... at least ever since "Losing the Battle".... 
That elevated your channel for me. 3 years ago I lost one of the closest people in my life (that I grew distant from sadly) and watching that video knowing that I cant possibly know how hard that must've been just to write, and your commitment to every facet I've ever seen of you speaks volumes to your character as a human being. At least I like to think so. Lots of people put on facades some more elaborate than others but you've always seemed earnest and sincere. It shocks me the vitriol you get sometimes, and I've never understood the crusades people can wage against total strangers online, yet I still see it happening time after time. I believe your an outstanding person and appreciate all the work (I cant fathom the energy Scott Cawthon has taken from you or the time! By now he owes you a few lunches at least) This started as one thing and drifted into many others I apologize, but if you happen to read this just know you helped this total stranger on a lot of down days to remember to keep moving forward... I think what I meant to say originally is if I see you on the couch than it's a must watch more than any fnaf and I just got both in one
MatPat: Lives

Idiots: You malicious evil being, how disgraceful.

So to them, everything wrong will get you sent into a 10 year sentence in jail?  [Insert Perfectly Cut Scream]
There is a hard mode on undertake I figure it it out and there is videos
people actually get mad at their art being seen by others.
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly..
He want he wants his money from Ally bank bacc
Edit: Holy schnauzer how the hecc did I get this many likes in such a small time. Thank you so much! :D
You are probably the most level-headed person I‚Äôve ever seen
Do you think that Game theory dpesnt have a problem? Keep dreaming bro.
16:45 Someone? ... make fan art? .... of MY characters?






hahahahahahahahaaaa
Another drama from Matpat... XD
"And if you're still listening to me then why aren't you watching that other episode?..." 

Because I just came from there....
MatPat, I really like you  and this kind video illustrates some of why.  I've followed you with one account or another for at least seven years.  Doing the right thing, even if it's not exciting to talk about in your channel, is awesome.  I'm glad you walked through this, because it honors the artists around the internet that don't always, but should, take pride in their work.
Tell me a story MattPat. That's why I watch.
It‚Äôs fan art... you drew a picture and posted it on the internet, don‚Äôt get butt hurt if it shows up in someone‚Äôs video for .2 seconds
4:47 you credited the wrong person
Seriously what did you think was gonna happen?
"Look at this thing I made that looks exactly like the original source material, geez I hope no one mistakes it for the original"
15:51

I agree with you
Been doing fan art for years. The only time I ever got mad at a repost was when some dude on Deviant Art was trying to pass off my hand drawn comic strips as his work. Folks who were unaware were happy to give him encouraging "attaboys" while he soaked them up and said "thanks, it was great making these" and the like. Obviously I put a stop to that one. But folks just sharing my stuff never bothered me, personally. I use to draw a LOT of Halo stuff and I don't own Halo anyway, so I never thought of it as mine. Just my way of sharing fun comics with like-minded folks and poking fun at a thing I loved. A thing that the whole Halo community loved. When folks would share them it made me feel like I'd reached them in a positive way. 
Times change I guess. Art is hyper competitive and it's tough to get noticed so I get it. But so long as no one is explicitly taking credit for work I did, I try to never get mad or let me feathers get ruffled. To each their own, tho.
MatPat for Youtube CEO!
MatPats gonna rant now, is what these should be called
Matpat:
Fanart creator: THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE YOU HIT A NEW LOW
Thank you MatPat you always help me and inspire me, I just hope some day I can start returning the favours
Matpat talk time or..... 






Chatpat...?
Dude u helped me with bullying
I think people that complain over fan made box arts have way too much time on their hands.
Something Matt said really struck a cord with me. He said before people would message him saying "hey. Saw that you used my fan art. That's so cool. Glad you liked it. Thanks for featuring it. Etc." Now it's "How dare you use my art and not say anything. You've reached a new low!". 
It's sad how people resort to the worse option that GT is doing it intentionally and not just saying "oh hey! My fan art! You can find me at (insert plug)". Damn the internet has gotten jaded.
But remember, it's just a chat.. a matchat! Thanks for watching
I never did understand why people got mad about others sharing their fan art to begin with. Like I get it, I get why. But really at the end of the day if gt used my content I'd be stoked.
MatPat is so sincere and honest we really don't deserve him
MatPat venting hour...
Scarce: Sorry guys no double upload today

Matpat: hey guys double upload today
i applaud you. but you can't hear it cause we live far away.
Fan art is art about a property that is not even owned by them. Therefore they have no right to claim property of an image that they made but don't own.
While I can respect fan artists wanting valid credit, it's still a bit ironic because fan art literally means you've taken someone else's creation and remade it. So, getting mad that someone then takes the remake and reuses it creates a rather complicated situation.
I don‚Äôt get the hate of Game Theory sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs like me and Star Wars Force awakens just because it‚Äôs new. I sometimes wonder if it‚Äôs like me and my friend trying to convince him that it‚Äôs not good, just to hear some one else agree.
Addressing game theory‚Äôs biggest problem
Me: is it fnaf?
Edit: HOLY! 300 likes????
I don‚Äôt blame you
I am not mad 
I didn‚Äôt even recognize
Dude I loved smoke üò≠
The only problem with GT "it's just a theory" philosophy is when the evidence we are asked to consider is false. Yes, I am still salty over the For Honor video, let me live.
MatPat you are a legend
BUT HEY, THAT'S JUST A TALK. A COUCH TALK. THANKS FOR WATCHING.
#CouchTalk
#Theoristswillhelpyouthroughthepain
This will probably be lost in the ocean of comments that already exist... but... why not feature specific fan artists when you make a video?  By that I mean specifically contact 3 or 4 artists and ask for permission to use their art and ONLY use their art or public domain stuff in the video.  That way everyone is happy.  You specifically advertise for the artists, they know its happening and there is no chance of accidentally not crediting someone or stealing something.

So instead of rolling the dice on a google search for art, you know exactly what you are getting and where its coming from.  It might create some issues on how fast you can pump out or create a video or you might have a harder time finding that PERFECT piece but I think the benefits outweigh all of that.  It protects your channel, it features and advertises the community/artists, and you make great videos.
You are the best youtuber, Matpat
We still love you mat!
Im just imagining matpat reading fan fiction and im cringing so hard xD
Your couch videos are better than your theory‚Äôs, I just feel like I get your emotions and your true personality from them.
gives a clap and a half :}
You shouldn‚Äôt worry a lot of people don‚Äôt mind
Someone: makes convincing fanart with no signature or watermark
Also that same person: OMG I can not believe you didn't give me credit and thought it was real! [Insert Surprised Pikachu Meme here]
THEM EYELASHES!!!!!
love u matpat
Is it me or is Mat becoming a YouTube warped millennial version of Bob Ross or Mr. Rodgers? Just incase you are not sure, I meant that as a compliment.
#wearehereforyouMatPat
You need to do a Ted talk about gaming/movies, theories and law issues within them
a collab with myself lmfao
About the box art thing: can people even be mad about ‚Äûstolen art‚Äú if it features official logos from nintendo etc? I mean they didn‚Äòt create those things themselves either and they are even copyrighted? I mean still not cool if you made something and someone else uses it without permission/credits but ehhhh
it should be called matchat with matpat!
It's "Thinky Sittie time with MatPat"
As a budding artist and graphic designer who puts their work online, i can't say how MUCH i appreciate this video. As artists, we dont get enough people trying to help us protect our artwork, especially before things like mass reposting happens. So thank you MatPat for bringing this issue to everyone's attention
Can fan art be copyrighted? What in 2019 is going on?! That should be illegal.
i agree with Yal Rathol
Mr. Patthew, you need an advisor.  This is one of the reasons they are there.
i just saw in the moddles  the "CRYING CHILD FONT" and we both know what that means 0-0
-matpat talks about stealing fanart



-twitter is full of "fortnite copied my OC"


This world...
Man, Matpat, you‚Äôre a good man. You‚Äôre not afraid to admit your mistakes. I honor that üèÖ
Mat rants!!
i like ur voice üëå
I'm really good at piecing things together
I liked the ending line 

"And remember: that's a talk, a couch talk! Thanks for watching" :D
everything is sort of fan art. everything.
i have been a big fan from all the way back to the Mario a sociopath. Game theory and film theory made me want to get out of bed in the mornings.[or nights......i didnt say i had a good sleep schedule]love you guys
jesus christ Matpad is so beautiful
Whenever I see matpat on the couch I get a little anxiety since it can be almost anything serious
"But hey! It's just a chat! A MatChat! Thanks for listening!"
That molecule behind mat pat is deoxyribose just had to get that out of my system
Just to be honest I really want to work with you Matpat.
IT'S JUST REALTALK, WITH MATPAT!
Isn't... isn't it obvious? It's just a theory... a COUCH Theory... thanks for watching.
Personally if I made fan art of something and people used it in videos, I would be happy about it. Even if they don't credit me for it. Although I would be pissed off if they claimed they made it
you should do a theory video on whats in Smoke's (from rainbow six siege) smoke canister! there isn't much evidance, to me anyways, but thats why im mentioning it to you because you maaaay stumble upon something i didn't, or wouldn't ever think to, id watch the trailer for the operator firstly incase theres any details in there
Matpat please use Creative Commons it makes everything easy
Hey MatPat, I love your work. I don't  overly criticize your work in this way, but more-so appreciate the science and critical thinking that you and your team puts into them. As a caring and trying professional  man in what I do, and what you and your team does, I know unintentional mistakes will be made. They and me/we can be some of the worst things that happen in any work place if something doesn't quite work as intended, but keep up your good work and deep insight up my mang. My only criticism I really know of it seems, is what it seems you used from your comparisons used, from my limited knowledge, that LegalEagle demonstrated from: Carlton v. Fortnite ‚Äî Copyright Dance-Off! (Real Law Review), that was submitted before your own video. Still a big fan, 

Jesse Vallier.
Ooh, is the problem that they keep making videos like this instead of getting back to business?
This whole "never forgive ANYTHING" culture has GOT to die. It's disgusting and only serves to push everyone further apart.
Given that it's so often the underlying subject matter, maybe these types of videos should be called "pleading with insufferable moral busybodies to acknowledge the humanity of others". Doesn't really roll off the tongue, though.
#enlighteningcouchtalk
A Game Reality (?)
I know this idea can be kind of time consuming, but have you ever thought of finding the creator of the fan art you want to use, then contacting them and ask their permission to use the art? I agree with all the ideas you said in the video, but this could be another one to think about
The correct answer is MatPat Chit Chat
Okay I know this is serious and all but just think of this. 





Chatpat
I felt like a kid that broke a window and got a good talking to.
Box Art REALLY!! Anybody with NO imagination like that has nothing to complain about.
Triple T, Tea Time Talk haha jk
There's MatPat, CatPat, ChatPat!
MatPat be careful at 18:46 the Eiffel Tower's lights are on
16:57 I heard "yiffing" and my mind went to Foxy. "DO.NOT.YIFF.THE.FOX."
Honestly its always the Critics
Call it "Couch Chat with MatPat"

Apologies if anyone else came up with this name. I'm just now watching it and have not looked at the comments.
I respect your work ethic Matt and your effort in addressing the issues with you. Most this stuff is over my head but it's interesting to see how stuff like this gets addressed and what the future of the internet is gonna look like with all this content and how easily we can access it
This channel faces so much hate and strife, and comes out stronger for it. Keep going. We're with you.
couch talk sounds good enough
I'm gonna be honest, I don't like you MatPat. But this is a very good video.
I miss the mat pat talk times hhh. ;v;
Does anyone else watch this with the sound off so it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre smoking hot bf is arguing with you. Thanks Mat
CRAP HE KNOWS ABOUT WATTPAD!!??
quickly deletes all of my fanifcs
I Miss Smike ü•∫
If only the music industry could be as understanding of YouTubers as fan artists are of Game Theory.
And there goes EU striking with Artikle 11, 12 and 13. Taking all of this out of anyones hands in putting it in the hands of the, early in your video mentioned, "big ones" (companys and lobbys).... very sad times...
Got to love getting the 404 error trying to hit the bell button...
Communicating to the community
is something not a lot of Youtubers do.

I love these videos too,
Comment below what we should call it.
MatPat Good Guy
Smike be like: "hey guys iths thsmike here"
Appreciate you addressing this
how about something along the lines of one on one since it is episodes where you address more personal matters to us with just you on a couch instead of the usual theory animated sequence keeping with the gamimng theme of one on one show downs(something like that) where society sees it also when two people have a hear to heartish conversation. Maybe something like Matto e Patto (from the saying mono e mono) :)
There's no "new low", Game Theory and you always concern topics like this like no other channel. Keep up with the superb work you always deliver. Lots of luv, bois.
Lamp shading smart moove
What even happened to smike? He posted 4 times last year, but 41 times the year before.
Should call it MatPat's ChitChat...
One like equals one Diet Coke for mat pat ü•§
Matpat sounds like he needs a hug in this video, u good bro?
So you're going to call these videos MatChats right?
unrelated to anything you say in this video, but your eyelashes are on fleek
You should call them ‚ÄúMat charts‚Äù
COUCH THEORY
"Chat with MatPat"
I will now create an Lara Croft model where the only difference is that her feet is a little larger. Now, that's my OC right there ¬©.
Aaaaaa you try so hard ‚ô•Ô∏è
such a well written video very carefully chosen language throughout, love you mat pat
If anyone honestly thinks MatPat is doing stuff like this maliciously, they have no idea the kind of person he truly is. 

HE IS A HUMAN. A HILARIOUS. KIND HEARTED. DORK. HE MAKES MISTAKES.
Couch talk :D
I have bought fan art from the original artist, I have it hanging...but NOW I think I am going to stop and take it all down!
Wow. MatPat is a gentlemanüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
You're the best
Honestly, if someone accidentally used my fan art without crediting me because they thought it was official, I'd find that quite flattering.


(Granted, I'd also be befuddled considering how god awful my artistic abilities are)
fursona video? FURsona video? WHAT FURSONA VIDEO?!?! (imma furry)
Matt talks from the serious couch
Soooo... The artist are meant to approach you instead?  Why can't you approach them instead?
Clearly people are upset because of not being credited, but blaming them for not approaching you is wrong.
You clearly and knowingly used arts that are not made by yourself, regardless of intent. 
But instead of you approaching the artist if you can use their art work, you want them to approach you instead and justify it as an accident.
Pictures don't accidentally appear on your videos, and I don't understand how is this an accident.


I know a lot of things have happened Mat, but this isn't you.  Glorifying the "accidental" usage of other people's work for its exposure to the masses without addressing the proper credits. (like your example of most viewed videos).  Everyone is different, and just because one event, a good scenario occurred, does not indicate that you can expect the same thing from other artist. 


Everyone is different, and though at the end of the video has illustrated proper ways to protect their art.  This does not excuse you for future usage of other people's work just because they don't follow the set of guidelines in protecting themselves.  Many are not aware and let's try to be considerate to those that don't.  


This video didn't even feel like an apology to those artist of which you used content without their proper knowledge.
The main problem is just allooooooooooooot of inaccurasies. Remember the squids? You got that thing entirely wrong.
If you post on DeviantArt please read the site‚Äôs terms and conditions. They have been known to use any art posted on their site for personal use including selling it to merch companies like Hot Topic. Protect your art, and protect yourself.
Mat Pat talking about death of the author. Goals.
Couch talk. I dub thee couch talk.
Game Theory's biggest problem is how a some of your theory's are completely off based and can be disproved if you played the game you made the theory on and don't just use the excuse its just a theory
I agree with you, mat, and its because i feel like google should be responsible for not making it simpler for understanding that its fanart. They have so much power and influence and they dont take responsibility for it. Its disgusting
After MatPat solves FNAF 7:
Scott Cawthon: (*releases FNAF 8*)
Something to keep in mind for fan art is it's relationship fair use as both parody art and commentary/criticism. 

But yes, the lines are very vague and it makes such things rather tricky and tactile to handle properly. Parody laws specifically always feel the most sketchy yet most times legal. (Ex. "Dumb Starbucks"). It is an awkward stance in general for any creator because it can easily go either way depending on the actions of both parties(if any). 

Either way, yes,as a you-tuber it is rather safe to fine comb everything and maintain good communication to help resolve what issues that slip through the cracks. some will love you for featuring art and some will destroy it simply just depends once more on the actions both parties take. As always, the most awkward topic to discuss but important simply for the sake of public and open communications.
Wait people still play Fnaf?
Endcap Idea:

And that's a talk
*tap chest over heart*
Straight from The Source
RealTalk with MatPat
A ‚Äúlittle‚Äù dose of education on the side?
Hahahahahahaha

I learn more from this show than I do from school.
Why are we complaining about Mats videos instead of watching them?
Shut up and post normal criticism  it's MATS channel
He can post whatever he wants.
:/
I've been a long supporter even before i made my channel. 
People need to give this guy more love. And i'm going to be one of those people.
New channel. Story time with matpat
This is dumb.  all the images used in mat pats videos would fall under fair use...
Can we all agree that there should be a book theory
Im gonna need to you to delete this video because your face is actually a bit of my fan art
I'm sorry to say this but I'm not really a fan of the new style of editing
But still the For Honor video was really bad
Fan arts ,  instead they should like their ideas are being used solution evolutionary
Hey Matpat, I just want to say your theories don‚Äôt make me mad at all they all make sense to me and these theories are for entertainment and just something to think about. I really love your videos keep them coming thank you again Matpat if I met you in person I would tell you everything about why I like your videos. Keep it up Matpat!üôÇ
Matpat does Matchat?


Aaaand remember, that's just a chat. A Matchat.


How's that for a title? The rhyme makes it roll off the tongue kinda
Good job üëçüèª

I think this is a dumb and boring topic.
I definitely have to agree with the recurring branding idea here:
MatChat sounds like a brilliant way to go :)
Why does all this technicality matter the images are a little different.
How is matpat so wise??
You guys are great MatPat. So great.  Don't feel bad.
Every serious video he makes it looks like he's about to break down and cry, so much how much he cares
He's here, he's there, he's everywhere. Who you gonna call? Your Psychic friend fredbear
No it doesn't lampshading intensifies
You could call them matchats or patchats.. maybe lol
How about MAT CHAT
Game Gabs is my suggestion for the on the couch talks but usually the on the couch stuff isn't quite so game focused so I could understand it not being used.
The first 45 seconds of the video captured the point perfectly. We're meant to hear the story and just have fun with it.
Hey I really like that jacket, where did you get it?
I think using fan art is fine so long as credit is given, and when you can‚Äôt at least source and citation. It‚Äôs like using quotes in your college essay.
Hey Matpat when u use my fan art it's ok for me because I am a fan of your channel even though I'm not credited its ok because it not even my characters sooo... It's ok I won't report you üòÅ
Do you think you could do The Division?
New series called ‚Äúlife theory‚Äù it can just be you talking about whatever is going on
You be stealing fan art mat of the pat how could you ima keep my stick figures away from you and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh don‚Äôt make fun of for honor that‚Äôs my game patmat
So, if you create a fan-art and want it to be credited, just SIGN THE DAMN THING. Or don't post it on the internet, it WILL be used without your permission, that's just a fact.
IT‚ÄôS A COW CHTOK
Please grow a beard you'll look awesome
Say what you want about MatPat, but at least he tries to address most criticisms ...  
Remember Mat, Haters always be hating!  Keep up the good work!  
Also, I vote Mat Chats as well!
It is all about the evidence.
while you should always credit artist and what not if you are an artist and do not make sure you are making it clear this is your art you will have these issues. best way water mark or sign the image where it can be seen. also fan art is a grey area to start alot of fan art i do i do not post. but if you draw fan art of a character do you credit the original artist of said character?
gahahahahahahahahha ahah aha ha ha chicken nugget time
You could mash up the Game Theory, Film Theory, and GT Live logos, with a framed "behind the scenes", or "ChatPat" (as was mentioned before by Blueberry paw) (or whatever) title prominently displayed.  The problem is though what to call it, and what catchy slogan to give it at the end of the videos.

Maybe you can get Austin to (in his best "serious Austin" voice) to say something like, "This has been a Moment with Matthew (or MatPat)," as the scene fades to gray scale and the aforementioned logo comes into view, reminiscent of the old fade outs used in television (and other mediums that I simply do not know).

/shrug It's just a thought.
You teach Education you can be a teacher
Mat chat
It's "No Walk Talk"
call it Couch theory
Mat pat: does a minor oopsie and apologizes

Random YouTube account that uses a still image mascot that moves up and down signifying when they talk: SO MAT PAT IS THE WORST, AND HERES A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY THAT ARE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTEXT
He‚Äôs weawy weawy serious.

It‚Äôs funny though. Fan art is literally copying a franchise. I don‚Äôt see why they get so worked up about others taking there work. I wouldn‚Äôt know though I don‚Äôt create it. but it just seems hypocritical.
So I've made some fake box art in my time as well, but I do so using official artwork / logos / etc. so I don't feel I have any kind of claim to the end result legally. And unless the guy who made the Kirby art drew all of that himself (he didn't), then he doesn't either. I still get why you would want to avoid using it without his permission out of courtesy, but he certainly had no right to go off over it. Not that that has ever stopped anyone on the internet before. ;)

The logical positivists thought of scientific theories as deductive theories‚Äîthat a theory's content is based on some formal system of logic and on basic axioms. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a logical consequence of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.

As an Fan Artist, Watching this video is really depressing, we can see the Internet Is on Copyright Apocalypse üò¢
I feel like JK Rowling should start referring to all of her new "content" (?) As her fanfiction ideas. Because like she can still tell us how Ron actually had 6 toes, and who ever wants to believe it will, and others who disagree wont. So anything Rowling says can never be considered cannon. But her wildly inventive ideas can still be heard.
thanks God you're not a sex offender I hope you're happy married
I liked Couch Talk
And that's a pat chat!
I saw a commenter say that you should call these videos: ‚ÄòMat Chats‚Äô and in my opinion it didn‚Äôt have even nearly enough likes, so I‚Äôm making another one promoting that name, so that there‚Äôs a better chance of Matpat seeing it. Feel free to do the same, but make sure you credit the original commenter: Gamin‚Äô Reasons
Youre a good speaker.
I think most of us (at least so I hope) understand that it¬¥s not your fault or at least you don¬¥t do it on purpose. It¬¥s also understandable that they the get mad...sometimes... but when you get to know someone, even if it¬¥s only through the internet, you should be able to recognize if that person does such things on purpose (stealing fan-art for this matter) or not; and I¬¥m being fully honest when I say I can¬¥t really see you wanting to do so, hurting people as if you didn¬¥t care. I believe you when you say it just slips through sometimes. Be careful, but most importantly, don¬¥t let people¬¥s outrages bring you down or discourage you  (even to the smallest point) to stop doing what you do.
I 100% agree
That's just a chat, a Mat Chat!
The fact that he even has to waste his time addressing this baffles me, what is wrong with people.
Great job!
Greedy fan artists...
I'd like to bring something to your attention that I want to see if you'll talk about and try to fight against. I'm sure you already know about this to some extent but in the past year I've seen three very good YouTubers that I watch regularly affected by YouTube's messy copyright claims system. One YouTuber creates theories like yourself, as well as other content

 The three I've seen battle against the false copyright claims so far are The Fat Rat, NerdECrafter, and now as of yesterday, Hello Future Me. The first two have settled their cases but not without a fight to get YouTube to even involve themselves in the issue. 

Hello Future Me has had seven videos now copyright claimed by Sony who is now taking most of his revenue from those videos. Nothing has evolved from this more recent case yet but I believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed by a content creator with a large following. 

I doubt this message will even be seen by you but if you do see this, please think about it. See what you can do to start something big that could help out these smaller Youtubers. Maybe see who else you can get involved in it. At the very least, make one of these sit down chat videos (MatChats, if you will) and discuss this with your audience. I'm tired of seeing the smaller creators I watch unable to fight against the terrible Copyright infringement system on YouTube.
Life Theory?
I like these videos to.   Maybe you should make the outro:

And remember!  That is just a talk.
A MatTalk!
Thanks for watching.
Oof ' ing sad. :(
Smike I miss him he was a good man
The idea that people could think you would do something maliciously to profit from stolen material just shows that they don't know your channel. I've literally been a fan since you used the tag line "tangential learning experience" and what looked like my attempt at a film for freshman humanities course. I'm a theorist at heart and have always loved the channel. Mat, you are definitely a good man and a supporter of the small guy. I'm thankful for your channel. Stay with us cause we are with you
Yeah, but link is dead tho
The Fnaf video says to watch this video first... but this one wants you watch the Fnaf video... Matpatception
This does not count for everyone, but I personally never think over where the pictures in a video come from. I watch MatPat's videos for entertainment only, and never consider where the pictures are coming from, or even who made them. Not that isnt important to adress that kind of information, but I think that the majority of the viewers on this platform, dosen't either. And for those persons who are interested in where the pictures came from, or sees that a YouTuber forgot to credit the creator of the fan-art, just continue to do so. But instead of nitpicking the creator for not acknowledging the fan-artists, or hating on them, try doing it in a more polite way.

I am currently writing my bachelor degree, and it is terribly hard to have control over all the sources that I am using and refer to all the right authors of articles and published books. Sometimes it even slips through without me, or my supervisors noticing it. The same can be said for YouTubers. There are some who dosen't care to acknowledge other peoples work, and there are does who do, like MatPat. That is what I mean by being more polite in telling the YouTuber that she/he made a mistake in forgeting to acknowledge the fan-artists. Remember that they are trying to do so, but that they somtimes might forget, and that there are others who don't care about it at all. Be real!

Thank you and goodnight!
I really don't understand the problem. You aren't claiming ownership; and you aren't making money off the artwork. Copyright law is flawed in that way. If you use a piece of artwork or music in your video - the viewers aren't watching BECAUSE of those assets. No one clicks on a Game Theory video thinking "Oh man, I'm so excited to see what still images they'll use in this episode."
If you're putting your name on that asset, or if you're outright saying "I made this," that's stealing. If your entire video is focused on that, i.e. the content and reason for making the video are that asset - THEN you are making money off someone else's work.
And, if you never intended to make any money off it - why do you have a problem with it? All it does is share your artwork with a wider audience. It gets more eyes on your work. It gives you credibility.
Yes, artwork should be credited whenever possible; but it baffles me as to why someone would be upset if someone used that artwork when the creator hasn't done something to say "hey, this is mine. Ask me if you want to use it."
Even though I've sorta stopped watching the Theories. I enjoy these videos alot! Keep it up!
Matt,  you did nothing wrong,  you tried your best, we all make mistakes,  we're only human,  besides,  some of us would love it if you used our fan art
PatChat?
99% of the time I agree with you MatPat.


The 1% you want to talk about serious stuff should have its own channel.


The old media calls this "branding" - letting us know instantly what you are about.


I'll watch you if I am 100% convinced that it will be fun for me, but I just don't know anymore. For me it seems like 10% of the time you just rant and that lost my appetite for for rest of the 90%.
I like MatPat. He's an interesting character

AHAHAHHAYAUAHAUA THE FANFICS
I don't like these couch talks .. ew so serious
Game company: makes character
Fan art person: makes convincing fan art of character that looks straight from the game 
Content creator: uses fan art thinking it‚Äôs an original 
Fan art person: gets mad at content creator for using the fan art when they literally did the same thing to the game company as the content creator did to them
Real Talk with MatPat

EDIT:  Forget this, Jai has the best name suggestion.

Personally, as a writer who has a couple fanfics under his belt and working on some original work, I would like to say that I'm still in the earlier mindset you mentioned, where we thought it was cool if someone big used our work.  Personally, I don't care if someone uses my fan-created stuff.  After all, I can't sell it due to copyright laws.  So I post it where people can read and enjoy it and that's that.  I don't know why people are so sensitive these days.  People "stealing" from people who "stole" characters for their own purposes, it's all ridiculous.  Everyone just needs to chill out.  I can understand if it was original work, but fan art?  Don't post it on the Internet if you don't want people using it.
The biggest thing now I feel is the mass reposting of art. Even if they have water marks, watermarks get cut out and blurred. It‚Äôs hard to find the original anymore. Plus some fan art looks so much so exact (such as the Kirby art). It‚Äôs very hard to tell.
Game theorys biggest problem are all these matpat "drama time" episodes
ive been watching you for a while ...wow that sounded creepy....anyway you got real with us so im going to get real with you, you put forth a lot of hard work for interesting theory and anyone attacking you for making one or two slip ups in art work then they clearly are not interested in your theories as a whole they are looking for something to complain about, any true fan will know your not in it for the art, your channel is called game art theories, and you put in so much work to calculate every single little detail down to pixel counting and figuring out, in some cases, rocket science and molecular bonding. you do amazing work and honestly you put in more work than most people do, i know im not going to sit there and calculate the sheer strength of a racket to see how hard mario is hitting a tennis ball to break it or count how many huns mulan killed with a fire work, but its that dedication to your videos that makes us, your fans, love you for your work so you keep doing your work and we will keep watching
That‚Äôs just an announcement... 
A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

Thanks for watching
Maybe it should be Mat-Chat
All my respect for this channel's team for trying their best to not steal art. Artists become frustrated when their art is repeatedly reposted on social media and sites they aren't in and even sold on redbubble and such. You at least are avoiding doing so as much as possible, unlike some youtubers who do steal artwork, rant that the artists are too butthurt and use the "but I'm using it for review purposes" excuse. *coughLilyOrchardcough*
Couch Theory!
i  like couch chats!
So you saw someone about to get sued and then you get scared. Here's what you do: Cry and Wine and beg for forgiveness. Lol People should sue and Defy deserves the soul you sold to them.
Thanks Matt
OH NO HE'S HOT
Matt Chat
If you put your creation online and don't put your name on it and make it prominent that it's yours. You can't expect people to credit you.
Thanks for not only apologizing for the mistakes, but explaining and giving tips to fanartists on how they can avoid their work becoming stolen or posted around without credit! I‚Äôm sorry that people have been tearing you down a lot. I‚Äôve been following your channel for years, now, long before I got this account, and you seem like a cool dude. These personal segment videos definitely cement that there‚Äôs a person behind the video persona, and after this one, I hope that even the fiercest of haters understand that mistakes can be made without maliciousness behind them.

Also, you could always call these kinds of videos The Couch: (insert title here). Since XD you mentioned it, yourself; you do sit on the couch.
Hey Matpat, I for one mistakes happen its ok, your only human. Don't let the whiners get you down.
Damn Russians.
call it a mat rant

Hello matthew patrick
Couch talk with ChatPat
whach toad.exe
Okay but I think we need to ask the real questions here.




Where do I sign to be adopted by Mat?
couch convo
Some one threatened to sue you didn't they?
Matpat and Chill
It should of been: "Its a fact...a mat fact."
How can you blame a person for using, without giving credit, an image that is supposed to look like a replica and is basically a forgery (since it does not carry any identification to say it is fake)?
Then why do you rip visuals from Pewdiepie?
You guys do an amazing job man! Everyone makes mistakes and the fact that you have tried your best before during and after is a credit to you and your team. Haters are always going to hate but that's their problem. Keep up the good work man been loving both game and film theory sooooo  much!!!!! :-D
Moments with Matpat
Wait so he‚Äôs in trouble for accidentally using fan works so real and barely labeled that it even developers trip over themselves?

I mean we‚Äôre not talking about cringy sonic OCs‚Ä¶ people are making fantastic artwork these days! Shoot rn if you gave me a decent enough render I could be fooled into thinking your Fakemon was leaked from Sword and Shield atm. Heck we almost already had that!
Wtf lol this is an issue? The heck lol
I don't get it. If you use official game art in your videos it's fair use, or something, but if you show fanart it's not? Or is it specifically about crediting, so as long as you credit you can use it as much as you want?
CouchPat
Kool...
Nobody should get into trouble for EXTREMELY accurate fanart that hasn't been watermarked correctly. Yes, I know watermarks are annoying and take away from the image itself, but it's a responsibility of the art creator to make sure their work is properly credited. Especially when the art is so accurate that not even the original creator can tell the difference.
TL;DR- Some of you are too good at graphic design. Stop it so the video creators can tell what is official art and what is fan art.
Couch Time with Matpat
at least you try to do something
I put my name on every meme I make even personal ones that are just share with my friends
I've been on both sides of this issue, and it's.. interesting.
- As an editor/designer, it can be very challenging to find original images. It's hard enough when an image looks authentic, but even harder when there's no indication of it being fan art (no watermark, signature, etc.).
- As an artist, I've had my art used in articles and other videos. I've contacted authors/creators and politely asked to be credited, and only once was I met with resistance. 
I think the important thing to remember is that people make honest mistakes - we just need to be respectful, communicate issues, and rectify them. At the end of the day, sharing art (with proper credit) only helps everyone: free exposure for the artists, and legal assets for the editor.
-
Love your work Mat; keep going strong <3.
Does anyone know something about his jacket? I think it is very cool
CouchPat
My biggest issue with game theory is lack of proper research after the for honor video I can‚Äôt trust any of the research you do but thanks for mentioning it 6:36 too bad you play it off as a joke just like Todd Howard and his glitchy messes he calls games
Chatpat time love it
It's rare to see a content creator with such strong morals, you're a good guy Matt. Thanks for showing such maturity on this subject.
I‚Äôve learned more from the game/film theorists team (including past theorists) then most of what I have learned at school. 

They are awesome people and I‚Äôm quite sure 99.9999% of people didn‚Äôt even notice those mixups


Edit: if my fan art (not that I make any) got used in anything and I didn‚Äôt get credit I might be pissed at that person however i would probably be really confused about why it wasn‚Äôt sighted.
I loved smike
The kirby instance felt reeally poorly defended. First off 6:44 thinking that was an official artwork. When it's surrounded by the actual official artwork. Then defending it by saying "It said version 2 on the reddit post, we just assumed it was an alternate version, look at these vastly different box arts!" With your example being Kirby's air ride US | JP (7:20)
What planet are you on? To compare a box art with a completely different colour palette and style to the official one to the case where the differences are: Kirby is smiling and the palette is a bit lighter (the different gamecube banner doesn't count because that's the Japanese GCN banner for every game and is not relevant to the box art). 
I'm not saying that you had malicious intentions, but maybe try to admit your mistake next time. If you ever need to defend yourself, look back at what you're saying and make sure that you are defending yourself, not digging yourself into an even deeper hole.
I love your theories on video games and movies and shows. They‚Äôre are really entertaining and you put in so much work into your videos. I love this channel and your content! Thank you Matpat!
If there's anybody that's earned the benefit of the doubt its definitely this channel. You and steph are really great people, I hope more people try to emulate you guys
mistake are mistakes we all make mistakes all you can do is learn from it
MatPat TalkTime is a good name
This was good.
Amusing irony: I watch the video while drawing two Pok√©mon-Gijinkas for my RP-group over at Deviantart -- in other words, I'm creating FanArt as the video runs in the background. =3

But yeah, giving credit to creators is apparently a thing. To dish out the best alias oddest example from my humble plate:
I got once a complaint from a ENG-YouTuber for using a midi from a JPN-forum, just because I could only give a link to said page in the credits, but not the creator's name. (Sorry, I can't read Kanji or Hiragana.)
--}This is a case I consider to be quite silly, since - even though I am an amateur-remixer - I for one write at least down, from where my midis are and which types of virtual-instruments I use. (Doesn't seem to be a common thing for other remixers. I almost never read in their comments, which VSTs or soundfonts their stuff contains.)

Anyways, I for one handle this topic rather uncomplicated. I'm fine with being either asked for permission to use my stuff or seeing my name appearing somewhere in the credits.
(This does sometimes happen to this nobody whom I am, yes. Although... I sometimes wish a specific Mety wouldn't have used my Sacred Grove Lullaby Vers. 1, because the bot-like comments over there get slowly annoying.)

Well, I suppose you don't read this comment, Matt, but in case you do: I really enjoy the videos on this channel. Therefore, please continue as long as you have fun with creating them.
I actually like these MatPat chats on the couch vids. 
üôÇüëçüèº
SCOT??? WHERE ARE YOU???
it‚Äôs just a chat... a MatChat
I take them seriously
If you post something on social media cites most of the websites have a clauses that says you don‚Äôt own what you post.
jeeeeezus how the F are you're supposed to spot that....unless I'm a die-hard fan I wouldn't be able to see it and tell the editor he did a good job
After having just seen some of the For Honor response videos to your video it is nice to see you address how that probably wasn't your finest video though I wonder if this is why you don't post as many historically relevant videos anymore (at least not any that could be controversial, true you talk about cannon balls and medieval alcohol still, but not quite like describing what vikings would be like).  Though I might have included your mini fight with Legal Eagle in there, though I honestly believe you got to the same conclusions the same way, and he over-reacted a bit, especially seeing as how he did a video copying you a couple weeks later lol.
Doesn't copyrighted artwork allow for the use so long as it is significantly changed? As an asset in Scott's sneak peak, it could be seen as significant changes. I do find it a bit ambiguous when it comes to the definition of "significant changes" though. However, coming from someone who does artwork, I can understand the frustration that can occur.
Mat Pat and the couch of honesty
That just a talk a Mat talk

Moral of the story : 
MATPAT READS THE FANFICS NO ONE IS SAFE 

Also 
Thank you Matpat for your wise words and advice
But where do fan artists get the permission to recreate the source material?
What really sucks is that videos like this, which are the most important in my opinion, arent getting the views like other videos.
That‚Äôs just an address... A Formal Address, thx for listening and being understanding to the current situation
A sit down with matpat
I like ‚Äúcouch talk‚Äù 
But I also agree with ‚Äúmat chats‚Äù from the comments below 

Also, question: can you upload pictures in the chat?
A MATCHAT
The problem is matpat, it's him it you
Copyright is something that we always need to take a lot of care, but I agree with what you said, sometimes, It's not intentional and things like that happen, mistakes can happen, and It's good to deal with it on the best way possible, being polite and trying to reach for the person instead of from the start already making a uproar. Amazing video, really help a lot to explain a lot about it! And hopefully help people understand these situations in a different light.
Not that this video ISNT important, because it is. its relevant in the lives of some folks even if it might not directly impact myself.
BUT before i continue watching past the 2 min mark i have something Important that needs to be shared, something that, i know for fact i tweeted to you just moments ago when i became aware of its existences @matpat
And since tweeter is tweeter i know sometimes things like that get lost so i'm going to leave this fairly large comment in the comment section in hopes that it'll be noticed, if not by yourself or those at game theory directly, then at least by my fellow viewers. 
And regardless of the my personal rage and disgust that i had extremely pointed out on the original subject matter in said original tweet post being shared, i still feel whole-heartedly that this needs to be addressed in a civil manner, if not for the system to work as its intended to, then simply for the safety of the poor abused child involved. 

Its sad that in this day and age child abuse is still a very common thing that goes unchecked more times then not. I'd like to think that everyone here at Gametheory - those that help in its process and creation of content and videos, and us the viewers, are pretty intelligent people.
So i'm reaching out to the community for your help on this matter. It might just be one child for now, but i think with enough help, enough voices saying "this is unacceptable" 

We as a whole can make a difference in not just one child's life, but many, and maybe even make a proactive stance against child abuse. So with that in mind, here's the link, and a plea for help for this child in need..



Please "Retweet" this subject until this poor child gets help and a loving family they deserve.

Child abuse is unacceptable. 

Help stop the Hurt.

That's all i really had to say. I'll continue watching the video now and make further comments on the video itself if i feel the need to.
people make fan made covers for game boxes? with ESRB ratings??
WHY?
seriously i'm baffled by this artform.
ThIs Is A nEw LoW
That's all you got out of that PB? Really!?!?
Chatpat!!!!
Mat Chat!
I love these videos which show the REAL side of Matt instead of the meme side that everyone has been making of him. Thank you Matt keep doing what you're doing!!!!
It's nice to be reminded that Youtubers are also human.
so this is just a thing your going to start for money now every so often
So.... The "fan art" version of the Kirby box is so similar to the original official box art that it is indistinguishable. How is this not plain and simple copying and theft of Nintendo's intellectual property? The "fan artist" didn't make any art. It's a forgery. Does that require technical skill and incredible attention to detail? Sure, if you're doing it manually. But the final result is the same (legally) as using a copy machine.

Let's put it another way. Say I'm a fan artist and my preferred medium is pressing my handcrafted engravings onto paper. I really love Benjamin Franklin, so I make a detailed fan art engraving of a $100 bill, and press it on to the finest quality linen papers. In fact, I have such attention to detail that I have made sure my fanart is precisely the same size and color as a real $100 bill. And I'm such a fan of Benjamin Franklin that I make thousands of these "fan art" $100 bills and give them to all my friends.

Guess what? I'll never be able to convince a judge that I just a harmless fan artist paying tribute to Benjamin Franklin and the incredibly talented engravers and printers at the US Mint.
I don‚Äôt normally go out of my way to leave comments, I just enjoy the video and move on, but I really, really enjoy these new videos that are coming out. As much as GTlive is a personal way for the audience to connect with y‚Äôall these seem just as important and a great way to communicate what goes on behind the scenes. You can sense the care and personal touches that not just you, matpat, put into these videos but your editors too. It‚Äôs nice to see videos with substance not just idol chatter. Keep it up! Can‚Äôt wait to see the next video! ‚ô•Ô∏è
When people are like "did you get personal permission to use that Bonnie fanart?" Did you get Scott Cawthon's permission to draw fanart of his characters? Almost certainly not. The entitlement is blinding.

You might not remember me but I was on the same cruise as you and got a picture with you at st marten
Cal it matt talk
I'm not a fan artist, but I feel like the one comment MatPat showed about the person saying "wow such a new low", is rediculous because of how similar it is, it's pretty much an exact copy if the actual box art, I would've expected that to be used and mistaken for actual box art.

It's so petty how people complain about little mistakes. He made a mistake, felt bad about it, and did his best to correct it. Pobody's nerfect. At least Matthew tries to correct his mistakes.
This comment isn't directed at MatPat but at the lower life-forms that needed to be told this... It's beyond pathetic when you literally have to make a video explaining that people make mistakes. That's the real "New Low"... And on top of that, literally having to give instructions on how to better protect your art... And here I thought I couldn't think any less about the human race... (insert extreme negativity here because it did in fact make me extremely angry that this video needed to be made)

I'm sorry you had to endured such idiocy.
It's just for fun guys except it's not except it is.... except it's not. But actually is. STOP CRITICIZING ME!!!!
its just a chat, a chit chat
You know, I've a big fans on your early days on Gametraillers. When your channel started to hit big was the same time I wanted more from my pop-culture/video games/movie analysis content. Analysis and essays on how a piece of art tells us more about our real world than it may seem.
You didn't deliver. Even now, self-defence copyright issues video and funny/pointless theories of pixels measurement are the lower form of entertainment, if entertaining at all.
You didn't evolve and when you adress your biggest problem.... it isn't.
Even Nintendo accidentally stole fan art.
Words of wisdom with Matt Pat
Take it with a grain of salt
WAIT A MINUTE! MATPAT KNOWS ABOUT WATTPAD!?!?!?!? WATTPADIANS UNITE!
Link isn‚Äôt dead
Mattpat:

Fan: T H I S I S A N E W L O W
‚ÄúIt is also worth noting that fan fiction and fan art can be a trademark violation as well, especially if it uses names and titles in a way that causes confusion as to whether they are official‚Äù -Plaigarism Today

Essentially, I wouldn‚Äôt be apologizing for using someone‚Äôs fan art without giving them credit. They are already on rocky legal ground for creating derivative works of original characters. Even MORE so if they are making a profit off those derivative works.
I think most people don't put their name on and you can't blame them, not putting a name on it doesn't give other people the right to steal. Mat made a honest mistake, and I'm really glad he approached it with respect and careful consideration. But there are people who intentionally steal artworks, videos, writings and either claim it as their own, or use it to make profit. Its a good thing that this issue is addressed, but people have different sensitivities and people create because they love the cannon/official work (which is why fanart may imitate the official work). You don't post something expecting it to be used without your knowledge and there's infinite possibilities as to where it'll end up. There's that.

Anyways good work Matpat, handled this in probably the best way it could be. Hopefully people who were enraged would see this and understand from another pov.
9:35 There is a fanart of Keyleth and Vax'ildan by Wendydoodles. Is there a chance MatPat is a critter? Or is it just a random picture from the interwebz?
This is how it should work put your mark on your art if it's not there well I don't know what to tell ya. If the arts used don't immediately think them not giving credit is a malicious act it can be a mistake so why crucify them especially when they fix it if they don't well go at em. What happened to common sense, common respect, and people excepting others opinions without hostility.
M8, how the hell are you supposed to tell that the box art was fanart? Seriously, there was no indication.
But if a fan gives you the idea of what to call these talks with mat pat. Wouldn't that be copyrighted lol...
Watching both videos I always thought since Mario is Nintendos even the fan art is stealing so kinda learned something.  I mean in thinking look at weird al.  He made songs off other songs never heard of him getting sued.
As a artist, and a fan I really appreciate this video.
I really don't see the problem here.
'It's just a chat, a Mat Chat.'  Simple and to the point just like the other tags. I think Jessie Bauer has the right idea.
thank you. as an artist, any art that is stolen honestly makes me so mad. artists, sign your work, and websites, give artists better policies. thank you for this MatChat (credit for that name goes to Jai)

Not sure if this question is better here or in the "FNAF: The Mistake" comments, but anyways.
If content creator made a character via character-creation in a game - as is typically seen in RPGs - then made that character their mascot/brand logo/whatever, what legalities does it fall under? Is it purely original content, inspired, fan-art, or something else?
I think we all need to remember that content creators are human. Even when you have a group of people working long and hard on a piece of content, mistakes will still happen because humans make mistakes. We need to stop being so hard on content creators for being as imperfect as the rest of us.
MatPat : The biggest problem of Game Theory
Me : Fnaf
everything that deals with copyright nowadays is abusive, pedantic, and moronic. the creators need to be held with more responsability for when they do want their stuff to be copyrighted and protected, and transformative use must be taken into more account and be more lenient towards those who borrow content from said creators. Also, in order to be a valid case for copyright, the offended should demonstrate how that "misuse" of his/her creation leads to any form of material loss. otherwise, its abusive and its leading towards article 15

Couch Time with Matt Pat / Mattie Pattie
Thanks for the informative video, MatPat.  I don't know why any fan artist would get as angry as you have indicated some do when they don't even sign their work.  If you want people to credit you, at least do that.  Otherwise, how is anyone supposed to know?  Common sense would tell me that if someone used my work without credit, it was likely a mistake and I just need to reach out to verify that it was and proper credit given.  No need to be irate.  You keep doing good work.
Me: waits for a Matpat Article 13 update
i think the only people who really have the right to complain about their art being featured without credit are the original artists themselves. so many people just like to whiteknight or use these minor scandals to fuel their own hate towards a creator. if the art is not yours, then it doesn't concern you, stfu. contact the original artist and make them aware of how and where their art is being used, if they have a problem with it, they will take the necessary steps themselves, they don't need you as a lapdog to do their work for them.
great job
I‚Äôm literally at 0:27 I already think I know where this vid is going bUT LITERALLY I‚ÄôVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS. GAME THEORY IS BASICALLY A VIDEO GAME CONSPIRACY CHANNEL IT‚ÄôS MEANT TO BE FUN EVERYONE JUST NEEDS TO CHILL

Also I remember everyone saying ‚Äúoh maybe these more real ones will get their own spin off ‚Äòreal theory‚Äô‚Äù or something, and that‚Äôs basically what these couch vids are and I love themmm lol. 


I wasn‚Äôt 100% right but I was close. As someone who makes fanart but is also a human who makes unforeseeable mistakes, I can‚Äôt really be mad if someone slips up. Human error is a thing and people over the internet who don‚Äôt even make videos really need to stop assuming that they know everything about the process.

Everyone takes accidents as personal slights nowadays. It probably doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs the internet, and getting people riled up is  easier than it should be. Especially when people take things out of context to bend to their facts.

People need to start taking some chill pills. Yeah, it sucks to have art uncredited and/or stolen, but it‚Äôs not the end of the world. At least try to be respectful before you know the situation. People really need to stop letting their assumptions about others run rampant before they have any facts about the situation/person,  if you are going to talk publicly about it, and ESPECIALLY if you want to post something to the internet that takes a stance on it, and  if you are an internet influencer. And for goodness sake, the least you could do is stop walking in trying to prove one side right or wrong y‚Äôall. That‚Äôs how witch hunts happen.
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs for entertainment. The Mario Mental Theory hit me hardüòÇ
These couch talks are quickly becoming the new reason I never miss a GT post!

Hm...
MatPat‚Äôs Chats?
Great video. Fan art is a slippery slope. it is true,a lot of people don‚Äôt know when they do a search on the internet if something is official fan art work and it can be hard to trace something back to the original creator. There is a lot of professional quality fan works. Many people believe ‚Äúwell ,if it is on the internet it is fair game.‚Äù

Identifying marks do help but they can be removed. In fact it doesn't even take a lot of work.
Personally, I have had my work stripped of all identifying measures I have taken and used without my permission, posted on sites used on products and sold on amazon and Ebay. Many places like Ebay and amazon do not allow the  removal of a listing if the person making the claim is not the property owner.

Believe it or not there are is not a lot of things in place that protect fan art and their artists. officially, fan art is considered  illegal because it infringes on the copyrights of the property owners. The only reason they don't pursue legal action is obviously you will be suing thousands of people. Not to mention how it looks publicly if they were to sue fan artists. The only rights a fan artist has is the idea presented in the fan work and that work's usage. But it gets even more sketchy when we are talking about fan edited game covers where they are using official art just rearranging them.

Might I suggest a bit of an olive branch ? Your videos depend on photos and clip art and official art to create the visual content. Why not hire an artist or fan artist to create some of this content as a posed to scouring the internet for images that fit your needs? So if you need an image of golden Freddy doing something he has never done why not hire and artist to create that content.? you not only showcase the fans but you don't need to question whether something is a legitimate piece of official art ?


Keep up the great work.
#WeAreHereForYouMattPatt
Does this apply to petco cause that theory was scary
PatChats
Mat is a mustache twirling villan trying to steal fanart for his own binfit


Nah april fools

Thx for making a video adressing this
Game Query
Bully‚Äôs
Aside from WIP photos I put up, I watermark everything and (when I remember to) put my copyright in the metadata of the image. Unfortunately 99% of the time that doesn't work at all. Either someone will come along and crop it out or cover it up, or it gets re-posted and no one bothers to actually look at the name. Then they'll ask "who made this?" while the re-poster answers "I don't know" even when my name is right there on the pic!
The only outrage that I have is... FNaF's still going!? What the hell, I thought it was wrapped up!
Matt Patt getting the raw end of outrage culture. I feel bad for him
There‚Äôs an ad on this video...
TLDR?
It's just a theory.
I guess the point of the video is that it is very hard to know if the source material you are using is credited correctly to the right, original creators. We all make mistake because we are just not perfect, and using so many materials for a video and crediting to everyone is probably or definitely very difficult things to do.
Matpat is such a good person for trying to protect fan artists. I support the idea that if he tries to protect them that they should also work to make sure it doesn't get stolen.
Oh thank heavens, I thought this was about their stolen money and the channel was going down. I was scared to click on this video for a week because I didn't want to see Game Theory be taken off.
OMG BEN'S FAMOUS
I love that jacket
chatpat?
It's ironic that people who are using other people's IP are mad at you for "stealing".
People just need to chill. Sure he made a mistake but no one is perfect . People just need to get over it.
: )
How would any sensible person realistically think that he stole their work intentionally, he showed it for literal seconds and the fact that only the artist or a few other people even noticed goes to show how it wasn't intentional.
this is why you don't do youtube
And remember, this was just a chat. A MatChat!! (Has a nice ring to it) 
*Boosting @Messy IIX idea
Oh matpat
I don‚Äôt like serious Matpat, is that s problem

Many youtubers milked FNAF to death.
> Flashback....
Well maybe people should consider making their fan art more different from the game , I would of never guessed that Bonnie was fan art I still don‚Äôt actually see a difference even after you tried to point it out
FDR had fireside chats, Matpat has Matpat Chats.
These people need to stop being buthurt. The art isn't even that good.
# deeppatt
You could call this either MatChat or Life Theory tbf. 

...I honestly think Life Theory would be EXTREMELY accurate. Either that or.... Life MATters..? Lol üòâ
MatPatChat
My only argument is who cares?  Fan art is fan art.  If you want to protect your art then watermark it.  Otherwise, the intellectual property that you are making fan art of is NOT yours anyways.  You don't own that property unless it is an original character.


I do not think that Mat Pat is at fault in any way for using fan art, especially since the fan art is not copy written or trademarked, and especially since most of it is not watermarked.
Us gov oops
I care about it
I know that the only reason other artist don't put watermarks or signatures in their drawings is so that their art looks legit but I don't think they can complain if something like that happens, it just means they achieved their goal of being more convincing than the real thing
Plus it's not like MatPat erased the signature and made money out of it, he just made a mistake and he's trying his best to make sure everyone understands what really happened and he even helps other people so they won't do the same
Mat I love you! I'm a content creator myself, so I'm very familiar with this whole line of art confusion. TBH they're just coming at you because you're a big bad bro!:D
When you realize you used fanart without consent, what you could do would be to pay a part of your earnings from the specific video to the artist. Not all of it, obviously, but at least pay them for part of your success.
Fun watch
This is one of the reasons Game Theory is my favorite.
The honesty.
It's insanely refreshing to see someone explain this kind of thing, and be honest about what's going on, why it's going on, and what they're doing and have tried to do to make it better. I didn't even know that this was an issue until Mat brought it up, and I appreciate that he did. I also appreciate the examples as well, where it didn't feel like an excuse, but an explanation.


The Game Theory team does do this for a living, yes, but they do it the most honest and respectful way that they can. For the time I've spent watching and loving this channel, I've never felt that this was a grueling job that people hate or couldn't stand and just do this because they have to. I've never felt that fake enthusiasm that so many YouTubers have when they've experienced burn-out. They've stuck to their guns from the beginning. Hell, during live streams they'll even talk about how they got little to no sleep because of all the projects they're working on. That my friends, is dedication. (Also, a certain degree of insanity... but dedication nonetheless). Dedication to something that you love, and adore. Dedication to an idea that they have always followed and adhered to.


I can't tell you guys how much I appreciate this channel, and how much time and effort everyone puts into it. The amount of care really shows, I think, and every time an episode comes out I always say a silent thank you to the team, because I know that this is something that they poured themselves into. I can't even imagine the amount of research and time that goes into creating and managing this kind of stuff. It's always of the highest quality, and they're honest: this stuff is hard to do. For me, knowing that only makes me appreciate what they do even more.


As a lurker I know I don't say it enough, but thank you to everyone on the Theorist team. For every video I watch, just know that I appreciate every line, every detail, every joke, your honesty, commitment, artistry, every nerdy reference, and more! I love how convincing the arguments are, how fascinating the worlds become, and how much I learn from every video. I really can't thank you all enough for being that refreshing ray of light in my day. I've followed you guys since high school and will graduate from college in about a year, and it has been a privilege to follow this channel so far. As always, I look forward to the future with you all in it <3


-A fan.
wait a second. mat you literally have an illegal picture of the Eiffel tower in those pictures. the one with the lights on at night... um did you mean to do that as a joke or was that a mistake. ill give you the benefit of the doubt that it was a mistake but just letting you know
also do a new opening where you say storytime with mat pat
I think people making fanart also have a responsibility in this. You don't want people to mistake your work for the real thing? You want credit? How about including a signature mark in your drawing, or something that might be become apparent to those looking for these things. Seriously, those fanarts are so good, and they try so hard to make it look like the real trademark characters, how could you blame people for making a mistake!
SEE! See all of you Mario haters because of game theory? He really is not a sociopath! Only when comparing to real life, our life and mentality. Mario is just fine. Honestly, just stop.
There were two dots in my phone case, and at one point, Matpat‚Äôs eyes lined up with them
a) Thank you for explaining to the internet what fanart/fanfics adds to the community and our enjoyment of the work.
b) This is something I'm worried about with the upcoming Article 13 things. Even if you have permission or credit the artist, will it still be blocked? 
c) Embrace the weird shipping and just "Keep Calm and Carry On".
Why dont u just call it chatpat
And this is why I have a problem with Mat covering law topics especially copyright. Why doesn't your team know about stock footage after all these years and why are they using Google search...the ultimate no no in art circles?? Google even states in the image search "some of these images may be subject to copyright".

Hell, I would have accepted that the team searched licensed Nintendo art or official game assets. Or maybe hiring an artist?

 and Mat hasn't even addressed the true problem: his team was searching copyrighted content from the beginning. Mat had no sense of copyright and trademark laws and doesn't grasp a big issue: dont use copyrighted material without a license.

So, sorry, I dont feel for someone who makes fanart who all of the sudden YEARS AND YEARS later has a come to jesus moment of being a huge hypocrite. Oh and masks the video by pointing out that editors cant tell the licensed content from fanart.

And just to mention to the many people who will claim "this has never been a problem before..." It has. It's why Nintendo went batnuts and took down content.

It's the reason Square Enix explicitly states in their FF14 online terms of service the characters are THEIR licensed property and they can file takedowns at any time regardless of if the image was fan made.
As a fan artist I would voluntarily give my art to matpat to use in his videos, no strings attached. Unfortunately I'm just a lousy artist
Chatpat
He made me feel like I was having a heart to heart with a trusted friend. Almost offered my phone a cup of coffee.
Biy yr silf new jens n log good
This video is pretty dumb tbh.
Let me explain...
As an artist myself, I think it's annoying to see people complain over Fan Art.
Sure! You "own" the ART, but FAN ART has never been LEGAL. Cause 
1. you don't own the IP 
And 2. You're drawing someone elses character, someone elses PROPERTY, WITHOUT their permission (Usually) and upload it to some  website.
Almost every artist on they internet has done this once or twice by now, and it's cool and all, but legally that's not allowed. 
Sure, companies don't SUE since it's their fans, and suing their own fans can really hurt them more than anything. Aaaand cause it's FREE marketing.
But it is, however, still ironic that artist are begging for "CREDIT" when they don't even watermark their art when that said ART already is of a character(s)/IP that you don't own.

So if someone uses said Fan Art without you having a watermark etc. that is your fault imo. It's very hypocritical of artists to call people out for stuff like this when they are doing something similar themselves.

And then there's the step further which is SELLING Fan Artwork... But let's not jump into that endless pit.
You can call them matt chats
Chair chat with matpat
I‚Äôm really glad your addressing these issues mat, I‚Äôve seen you under so much fire and I‚Äôd just hoped you fixed some issues up, stay strong and keep on
Does it really matter? Fans don't get paid for fan art because it's not their art. It wouldn't even insist without being based on something else
if you're all going to have a go about this technically that means that  means that we can't even post memes anymore because not unless you originally created the mean you can't technically post them here on your Facebook
Finally, how is fan art not a theft of original art? How do these artists even have a leg to stand on when the lateral differences between their art and an orginal is a rounded edge on a character????  The whole legal world is based on "Would an average person know the difference?" the answer is NO, that person STOLE the art to begin with.

Funny how everyone steals from everybody, including fan artists stealing characters from the original creators, but nobody wants to share anything.

Ugh man, the fan art communities are the worst to begin with.  It‚Äôs like a bunch of rats fighting over scraps from a high-end restaurant.
How about calling these talks ‚Äú A MatChat‚Äù üòÇ then you say thanks for listening instead of thanks for watching. ( this was nice to listen to while I was doing my homework)
Sorry Mat. People are just so sensitive these days. Everyone needs to take a chill pill and realize just how much work goes into these videos.
Mat, here's the thing. I don't think you've honestly done much wrong here. But your theories have gone down in quality, but I can't change that. I don't think "you shouldn't take any of it serious" is a good defense, but I can't in all honesty prove it wrong, I'm just not really too smart in all honesty. Do I feel like your defense is spotty? Yes. Especially in that it feels like you often feel the need to distract from the actual apology. You can address these things in another video, or you could just section parts off into an apology and a defense. All in all, I don't think you're a dick, I just don't think you're doing the right thing sometimes.
I actually had some pages closed down, because they stole my fan art, and put it up on their sites, and claimed it as theirs. Asked them nicely first, to remove it. They didn't. Then I contacted the host. And their page was deleted. Muahahaahahaha.  The idiots claimed it as theirs, yet my name - and website address was still on the art. They had it coming.
I‚Äôm a bit surprised that Mat didn‚Äôt address a bigger issue being him not being able to take constructive criticism and just writing it off as hate. I‚Äôm glad that he‚Äôs owning up to this, but I would hope that he brings this up on his next ‚Äútalk‚Äù.
Don't beat yourself up man! Personally I'd be thrilled and honoured if fanart of mine ended up in an episode
If you are going to talk about something serious like this, actually title what the video is about. Clickbait undermines sincerity.
Why do all youtubers seem to be afraid to say 4chan (PewDiePie, this video)?
Mat Chat! Couch time with Chat Pat?
Is this why the lewd fan art gone?
Could it be a possibility for an artist like myself to help your channel by making fanart that you can use for your videos?
What‚Äôs the chemo on the wall?
Someone help me understand: if I just see a cool picture online and want to share it with friends, never showing them the creator or anything, that‚Äôs cool and good. But if I post it to an online account saying ‚ÄúI found this and like it‚Äù that‚Äôs ‚Äústealing art.‚Äù
chatpat
Wow, that‚Äôs so insane. You‚Äôre not doing it on purpose. It‚Äôs really cool that you‚Äôre trying though.
Chin up MatPat, I think most reasonable people know you're an honourable dude.
Since you made this video about fan art I'm like 90 percent sure I saw a porn that was supposed to be matpat or at the very least he sounded like you alot. Sorry if this comes of as creepy I just thought it was interesting.... but hey it's just a theory
And that‚Äôs been another Chit-Chat with Mat Pat! Thanks for watching.
i agree with shawdgawd you are my favourite youtube channel that does theory's
Very well handled Matpat. You and your team are definitely people to look up to with these regards.
This was helpful ^^ If you need art let me know lol
i did mario 3ds pacifices on the leves and less pacifist on the bosses but i took 6 frikin hours
My favorite theory is binding of Isaac

The couch talk episodes should be called mat pat contemplates about life
Why not put all credit to artists at the end of the video? The specific name if you can find it?
Whenever I see YouTubers that monetize and are popular they look rich so I'm like "I thought you all said you didn't get that much from YouTube-"
Couch Theory?
But hey that‚Äôs just a chat a Matchat thanks for watching
MatPat you‚Äôre amazing honestly someone could just apologize and wait a few weeks then do it again but you apologize explain and try not to ever do it again you are a great person
MATCHAT
Sometimes finding the original owner/creator/copyright owner is so difficult. I don't deal with fanart but copyright material so I get it. Except I don't get some twitter gremlin getting angry over nothing and decides to twitter shame instead of contacting directly
Aw yeah, another chitchat with matpat
A MatpatChat
Thanks for covering this Matpat, it's a very important topic and I feel like you discussed it in a very respectful and informative way
"Luigi's hoo ha" -Matpat 2019
Probably my favorite video by The Game Theorists channel. Love you, and feel like a more personal connection between you and us
Joke one: "But hey, that's just a new low!"

Serious one: "But hey, that's just my side of the issue!"
Reminder that Smash Ultimate accidentally included fan-art for a spirit. Nintendo themselves used a piece of fan-art for the ‚ÄúMasked Man‚Äù spirit, nobody is perfect.
Hey matpat for your outro how about ( and remember  That's facts real facts) or talk facts  if u would like to use this
You should call it Friday with MatPat!!
CALL THESE TALKS MATCHATS. Or MatPatChats whichever works.
May I suggest calling it "The Facts Couch"?
"But that's just an update. A life update. Thanks for watching." IDK that's about the best I got for ya MatPat
I know this probably won't work with the ending but the rant couch is my favourite name so far
No it's really the "mentaly correct" as change throught time
***REAL TALK with MAT PATT** would be a great title
MatChat sounds appropriate to me
COUCH THEORY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Isn't there some kind of 10 seconds rule for images on YouTube? Like if you use an image for less than 10s in a 10 minute video, it is considered Fair Use? Correct me if I'm wrong here.
I love couch storytime....or matpatchats
Hey guess what, if you don't own the character you're drawing, it's not your property to complain about people not being able to tell that its fan art. Also, he has all the right int he world to use your fan art because his work is transformative. He doesn't even have to give credit.
Your biggest problem isn't the issue with fan art it is how people take your theories as fact
And remember, that‚Äôs just a talk. A couch talk!!!
I think ‚Äúcouch talk‚Äù sounds good
Matpat is a good dude looking out for the people. game theory forever!
brand it as "Calm Talk of Game and Theory" or "Pat on the Mat"
Last months have been really dark, I wish we could just move on and have happy theories again :c
And that's just a talk! A Theorist talk!
Listen to Human League's "I'm only human, of flesh and blood"
Lectures with DadPat.
gonna be honest, this did not go where I thought it was going.

I thought the biggest problem on this channel was a lot of the more recent theories have been less about piecing together evidence or actual theorizing, and more just some wild claim, with cherry picked examples to support it, even when the games have stuff directly contradicting the theory. 

like, that's my biggest issue about this channel, I didn't even know the fan-art thing was a thing at all.
If i was Matpat I would run fanart competitions. For a chance for the work to be on the video. However he can ONLY use the art for videos and make ot clear its art from the competition, just an * in the corner or something, and at the end of each video have a slide show of all the art used with the artist name and their portfilio (if they want to share this information) and have links in the description that way Mat will have a large pool of images to use, and artists will have a chance to have their art that seen by millions, for drawing something that is fun (most can't legally sell fan art anyways). 

Mind you typing this out I realise how complicated it all this is... it's so tricky :/
You know I'm really glad to see this personally. Ever since I found out about some of these issues on game theory I've felt a bit awkward about it because it had never been publicly addressed. I just want to say that I can totally understand though. I know how hard it can be to just make videos with large amounts of image searches and editing, (especially when your not paid for it lol) Honestly I feel that sometimes, just sometimes, fun things should just be left for fun without so many people causing problems. 

As usual you have my support my dude, I love your content and it's always a blast to watch.
ness is sans.
So... you were telling me that wasn‚Äôt official art???
You could put a list of urls in the description saying where you got the various assets from, or have a list labeled, "Users who uploaded assets used in this video". If nothing else, it helps people who like an image find where it came from.
I thought your Theory was to make a point that video games connect to reality???????
Matthew Patrick is it so yeah
this comment is pretty/completely unrelated to this video, but i find this excuse to write down some of my thoughts as an old fan for Game Theory, this is my take on how i see Game theory:
rn, its about giving a interesting story and using science/math and other factoids to craft it.
way back, it was about learning/teaching a subject and taking a story/game as an excuse to explore it and craft it.

thats just how it has felt for me, i didn‚Äôt feel like the old videos where trying to be ‚Äúentertaining‚Äù per say , they where just made entertaining/theory-like so as to have an excuse to explore/teach something new, and as it progressed, it got better on the presentation and format, but i feel like at some point it changed to ‚Äúfirst comes the franchise/story, then theory/tittle, then the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù or knowledge from it ‚Äù


not exactly a ‚Äúbad‚Äù change, just a reason why i think its now a meme that game theory is more about clickbaity and absurd tittles/theories and stories,  when that didn‚Äôt even feel important due to the learning subject being the thing that glued it.
i think that its partially why i find Austin‚Äôs content more reminiscent of why i subscribed to game theory, its more about the learning subject and the story/obscene stuff comes after.

anyway, i think im starting to ramble now,
i guess i also miss the very old end card of ‚Äúwhat we learned today‚Äù, back when the jokes where just trying to get you to pay attention and not necessarily get you to laugh, but maybe chuckle at at-least one...instead of [insert pop cultural radical joke here] > [introduction] > [lit joke here] > [ story/theory twist ] > ect....

anyway, Mat your and ok person, stop calling everyone who jumped off a hater, and idk, maybe take a break if playing the youtube/company game is affecting you.   im still gonna be sticking through, i guess i have too much nostalgia to completely stop watching, and i still find some videos worth a while,  just not every single video like back then.(which is sort of understandable)



..anyway, i‚Äôve been definitely rambling for too long, sorry if anyone read through all that, take care.
Lol poor MatPat reads his fan fiction. Bet ya can never unread that!
He should call it Couch Chat with MatPat
Casual Couch Catchup
Hey, come on guys, Mr. Matthew Patrick, really needs to be understood more. Stating him as a "mr", because he's now a father who's "middle-aged".
Mat Chat
Matpat:    'im not a lawyer don't listen to me'

Also Matpat:    'I recommend you do this to stay out of trouble'

jk we love you matpat. cheer up buddy.
Wow this video unexpectedly made me feel good about not taking a picture of the Eiffel Tower while I was in Paris.
Hey mat, if you need some fanart that won't get you copy striked, hit me up and you'll have it in a year or 2.

Don't actually. Pls I don't wanna feel bad for missing a email from you that you needed for a video.
TL;DR, people think companies are giant highly precise machines, and not entities that are other people.
It's admirable that you would address an issue some viewers have raised with you, and you have my respect...*tips hat*
Hey MatPat I really enjoy these videos, any couch video you‚Äôve uploaded has always given the fans an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes, hopefully with more Theory vids we can get more couch stuff and more bts with you and the crew.
A Couch Theory
Sometimes fanart is really stupid for lots of reasons.
Make another Poppy theory. What is the scary mask?
mat rants!
Omg I remmeber Smike...
5:52 funny you say that when you say at first that you didn't do your research and need to correct it in comments you've made, only later to put out a comment that says you had 3 other people check if it was correct. And now that this issue has come up, even more damning evidence can be stacked against you.
9:38

WAS THAT A CRITICAL ROLE ART PIECE I SAW?
yeet
i honestly dont know lol
Hell yea MatPat! You probably won't ever see this comment, but I love how honest and earnest and sincere you are. Anyone that believes you are out to be malicious isn't worth your time of day. Thank you for freely accessed and the pinnacle of enjoyable content. Believe it or not, I tune in more often for couch talks than even regular videos. Do you man!
sad for you
As an artist, thank you for the consideration you've put into this. Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with a piece of fan art I've created appearing in a random "family friendly" YouTube video, monetized or not. I think the bigger issue around artist rights is companies that take art to use on products. The difference here is one use in a loving way vs skirting what should be a licensing deal on something that will potentially be sold over and over again.
You can call them MatChats
Just call it ChatPat
In situations where it looks identical to the original, or lets say 90% the same. The character isn't yours...Don't be surprised or offended if someone uses it thinking it's original, you are essentially copying it from the original creator anyway. Beyond that if it's for a video where it could be a game asset being used in the same way for transformative purpose, you have even less right to whine.
No one is perfect.

You did good Madpat
Matpat no one's perfect every human being makes mistakes don't try to beat yourself up about it keep doing what you're doing
mentioning credits, maybe game theory should have credits and mat pat could add fan art accreditation in the credits.
Couch talks 

Amazing 

Call them couch talks
Can I just put in how a fan artist named Toyble ended up being hired by Akira Toriyama and goes by Toyotaro now and does the official manga for Dragonball Super?
What about Creative Commons?
It is amazing
Maybe call it, "On the Couch with Matpat"
Matpat should consider making a separate channel called Couch Theory
Knowledge Couch Cache
I'm almost sure matpat is an angel that's how pure he is
Exactly, it's hard to avoid mistakes all the time, especially when you're doing something so large. Does it excuse it? No! But mistakes happen, and you shouldn't beat people up over it forever. That's why I don't get why all these people (and Toby Fox) are angry at Game Theory for clicking baiting using Undertale for their Heartbound stream. Like..... everyone click baits. It was a mistake. Should they have done that? No, but it's still no reason to be pissed at them forever. The Game Theorists are legitimately good people and it makes me sad to see others hate on them for things like that.
That's just a Talk... A Couch Talk!
How about you call these a "MatPat Chitchat"
Call them "MatPat All Chats"
MatPat, I'll be honest.  Some of your videos did hit a few buttons with me, but I do respect you and your team.  MatPat, videos like this you truly have gained more of my respect for you and your channel.  I'm glad that you can do these kind of videos to "Show the behind the Scenes kinda stuff."  I respect you MatPat.  And good luck in the future.
Don't let them get you down. I will always support Yall.  You have brought many years of laughter, enjoyment and most importantly thought.  I've been following for a long time MatPat.  You are doing well and the majority of theorists are on your side.  Just remember the number one rule of the internet: Don't feed the trolls.
HEY HEY HEEEEY MatPat.... Don't start going around hatin' on Mustache Twirling Villians...... They got their reasons for tying damsels in distress onto railroad tracks. One does not simply question the method of their insanity.
chest hair
chatpat
MatPat is honestly one of the best YouTubers. So much logic, so much respec for the artists. The transparency of Game Theory is great. Stay gold <3

Also, I dig storytime with MatPat üòÇ
That's just a talk
A life talk! Thanks for listening!
Matt mate, just gimmie some more of the dank numbers. A good chunk of us miss those old physics driven episodes!
Ya.. fan artists are getting really good but do agree that they need some kinda marking if they don't want their art be confused with offical ones.
This series should be called "Off the Couch with MATTPAT"
Those segment should be called "chatpat time"
Hey Austin about the what are creepers, Why creepers are scared of oceolet anyway?
Oh I thought this was going to be about the time you accosted another youtuber for daring to say you MIGHT have taken inspiration from their video and that they are okay with that.
THATS JUST A TALK. A TED TALK
Heya Matt and Steph, I got a friend request (via Gmail) from this channel on January 20th. Was it real? It said it expired but I don't remember being notified. It would be awesome if you guys saw this and explained what that was. I really hope I hadn't missed some randomized contest.  Anyways, keep up the great videos! I love your videos and try and support the channel when I can.
Since you're basically talking to the viewer how about Mat's chitchat or something along that... But that rhymes.
Imagine being so upset over something intended to just be fun speculation
Couch Theory? NonTheory? MatTheory?
Hey MatPat!! I believe you should stop beating yourself up. Humans make mistakes. You're a great, awesome, and smart potato that only cares making the community more aware of everything around them with no malicious intent behind any mistake. People who only know half of the story don't know what goes behind thousands of work hours. You are awesome and a great inspiration to thousands or millions of people! You are to me. Keep the great work Mat!!üíöüíö
But hey that's just the truth. A great truth! Thanks for keeping it real!üíö
(you're right it's hard coming up for something as the outro on the spot)
AND REMEMBER! THAT'S JUST A... hmmm... uh... couch talk was pretty good... but what if... ahem, lemme try something. 


AND REMEMBER! THAT'S JUST A LECTURE. A LOUNGE LECTURE! THANKS FOR WATCHING!
If someone says "Oh I created this art" But they didn't, that's when you say something. Matpat doesn't say that. He doesn't claim the art.
If jumping to conclusions were an olympic sport, everyone on the internet would have a giant gold medal.
sounds like people are being petty over minor alterations to what was someone else's work in the first place. but good on you for taking the high road Matt.
MatPat i want to thank you for understanding how serious this issue is. Half the comments are people saying its not that serious but it really is, using fanart (or original art too) without credit HUGELY hurts artists- it doesnt give exposure because they dont get any actual exposure- their piece does but they dont. of course people can go too far into the hate machine but it really does mean a lot to me as an artist that you are understanding and are working to improve how people think about it :)
artists cant eat and therefor cant create if we dont get money :)
I don't understand why there is a whole community that exists to hate Matt Patt, to me he seems like an honest guy just trying to entertain people. I can only assume that they are jealous or just sad.
FINALLY
I got a clip of matpat himself saying that most theories are just for fun
Brand this as "Ramblings of man on couch with too many zippers!"
Would "MatPat Paused", be a good title for this?
you should make a halo theory since its coming to pc
can someone hit me with a TLDR cause my study break is only 10 minutes...
What's the source behind the stock image of the generic guy who appears in your videos. You know who I'm talking about.
MatPat's Cat Book-end Side Chats?
I think its awsome that you do game theorys, and it makes since a lot of the time :)
Matpat you should call these ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk‚Äù.
And that's just a talk a COUCH TALK!! I like it.. Use it
honestly i think that these kinds of videos feel like you're fixing something in a good and healthy way, maybe MatPatch?
i really like the MatPat Talk Time lol
Game Theory's biggest problem is MatPat
Brand it..."That's That with MatPat"   so when you end you can says and thats that with MatPat..
FAXXXXXX
Best Youtuber
Technically you don't actually have to worry about this because you're using the images in fair use, but it is better to use official artwork so you don't confuse your audience about what's official and what's fanmade. When I saw that fake Kirby cover for the first time I was like "wait, that's not the cover art" and if you had used that original editing clip I probably would've thought "wait those salvages aren't in the game" best to not have your words contradicted by the editing, y'know?
This has been Real Talk with Mat Pat
When you showed the playlist of FNAF and talked about just listening to a good story, I remembered following you from early on, and the original FNAF video.... it was haunting. When you covered the real shooting at the restaurant... its one of the most powerful and enthralling videos. I'll always be a fan.
Matpat talking head video's you don't really need to watch them you can just listen with some headphones while you do something else. Sort of like Gimmeabreakman/Gimmeaflakeman's youtube channel.
OBJECTION! I searched Kirby star allies boxart with reuse and modification and there were no results, so you clearly didn't turn your anti fanart search on before getting the image. How do you explain that!?
WAIT what was first game theory or film theory
"MatPat Talk Time" OR may I suggest... "CHATPAT" ???
He used fan art in this video. Banned.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'd call these segments "Reality Reels."
couch theory? idk maybe
It's just a talk. A REAL TALK! Thanks for watching.
Perfect name: The Matpat Chat
Matpat's Matchat: Where Matpat talks about whatever he wants. lol
I'm so glad someone in this flipping world understands!


A little story here about uncredited fanart: So a long while ago I posted a fanart on a FB group and the fanart I posted didn't have a signature or a watermark on it and so little Miss, or Mr., admin there commented on my post saying how I needed to credit the artist and yeah I understood but I told them that I didn't know who owned it and I didn't want to mistakingly give credit to the wrong person, the fanart I found was on Pinterest so I didn't really trust the name on it. 
The admin said if I didn't give credit to the artist, even though they know I can't find the owner of it, that they would turn off the comment sections and which they did. 
I wasn't happy at the time because I thought "If you're gonna mute my post then why was it approved in the first place?!" And yes I did say something along those lines.


As an artist myself I would want to keep my artwork safe, but I won't call out on people and make them feel bad, forcing them to take something down they've created. I mean why would you EVER say something so mean and maybe hurtful to someone and telling them they're stealing from someone when they are not meaning to do so! YouTubers here are just trying to make you smile and if they put your artwork into the video then just be freaking happy SO MANY other people who may not have seen it will now see it! And if someone in the comments asks who the original creator is the YouTuber while answer 100% honestly! Especially MatPat! So give YouTubers a break, they're already dealing with a lot more crap then we are probably!


 Just be more understanding guys, please. Things are changing in this world, I'm afraid it's not for the better.
I'll keep making my own artwork/fanart and I assure you if you use any of my work in your videos I am cool with it, I just ask if you could be honest on who the original creator is. 


P.S Sorry for being dramatic, none of what I said is a fact.
why does Matpat eternally talk like he's in a commercial
#matpatTalkTime
You couldn't be more melodramatic
The talking theorist
ChitChat with MatPat
Uhhh uhhh Sans Equals Ness
Mat, I'm convinced that people are determined to hate you (and Jimmy Fallon) for being 'too happy' and for being successful. I think if you cut off your arm to atone for your 'sins', they'd hate you for bleeding on them. 
Don't forget though that some people still love you (and not just kids - I'll be 41 this year), & we're aware that mistakes happen.
Behold the new series ‚ÄúMatPat‚Äôs Existential Crisis Corner‚Äù; unrelated, time to come up with a watermark now for my stuff, great vid
Your theories make games (and films) a lot more interesting.


...did Game Theory do Tetris already? DO TETRIS.
That was just a story.  A MattPatt Story.
Hmmm... what about one of these 3 options:
"The truth about that, with MatPat!"
"Breaking the chat, with MatPat!"
"What a shock, MatPat's truth talk"
Love the vox machina fan art from wendydoodle.
It's a Matcast? 
It's a Matnews
hmmmm can't think of a good one so far.
Oh Matpat, you're such a wholesome lovely man. Always trying your best to do what's right!
man don't worry! we all make mistakes
I mean I would be pissed off if people used my fan art without my permission but I hope we all can pause ourselves before acting out of anger and step into the other person's shoes in these types of copyright situation
Why do you always sound AND look like youre about to cry
Please do a theory on how many safety regulations Wonder Park is breaking
Matt has a hairy neck
Good on you man. I appreciate the in-depth explanation of how and why this happens, and how to best avoid it.
I hate how people just assume everything, like just because he has a "fan art" in his video doesn't mean he meant to put a fan art in there and neglect the real one
Behind The Theory, Mattsplaining, Pat Chats, Real Theory, Just some off the cuff Ideas for a title for these type of videos.
Good video mat pat
MatPat:"Friend...have you seen the Persona video?"

Me: HA GOTEEM
The real problem is Article 13.
Okay if you create fanarts and don't put any watermark or signature or any way of showing that it's fanart, you shouldn't be upset at people for accidentally using it. (ALSO I SAW THAT PHAN-ART IN THERE AND I AM QUITE HAPPY)
I find that the internet is the most unforgiving place on earth. People need to have more mercy for God‚Äôs sake!
This is corny, so it actually might work with for MatPat...
"That's a just Fact..... a Pat-Fact. Thanks for watching."
Keep up the great work. Love you guys (and gals) at GT and FT.
I am so glad you addressed this publicly. I never thought you were malicious about any of it, but it is so important to be transparent with your audience. I am glad that you took responsibility for your mistakes and then offered advice to help artists get credit without blaming them for not doing it. Many young people don't understand copyright law or how businesses abuse it. 
Keep making these couch talks. The more transparent you are, the more understanding the audience will be. Personally, I have really enjoyed seeing the more human side of one of my favorite creators for the past 7 years. These videos also set a good example for other businesses as fans come to expect transparency from their favorite creators and brands. With your audience, making these videos can create serious positive change.
U people are too sensitive.
MatPat Makes Words of Wisdom.
(R) DareDiablo lol
But in all seriousness, use it v√¶r s√• snill
this deep fried meme is my fan-art, do not steal.
bird noises
brand idea:
matt's malingering messages
good video. I think you should just call these videos 'couch talk' <3
I guess matpat agrees on article 13..
OMG MATPAT WHY DON'T YOU PIN PBG
When is the next Kirby episode coming out
Ahh, another episode of Couch Theory.
Mat is the bill nye of video games
#CouchPat
Reality Check with MatPat
A new low? Have you not seen Ness is Sans... But In all seriousness we all make mistakes. We‚Äôre all not perfect, we slip up at times. So hopefully things go well in the future.
@The Game Theorists Have you ever tried to make your own Discord Server?
"And that's just a talk. A couch talk. Goodnight everybody!" Wonderful save there MatPat
Hey MatPat, it's really cool how you addressed this issue the way you did. Props to you man. I like your integrity and I'm glad that there are guys like you and your team that are pretty well known in world, that still try their best to make sure that you're not stepping on anyone's toes. Big and little guys alike. Theorist Fist Bump


P.S. "Couch Theories", "Behind the Theory", "Lost Theories", "Theory Co-Op", "MatPat Facts", "Theorists Save Point", "Theory Save Point", "OBJECTION! Theory", "Theory Respawn", "GameFAQS"....wait
As someone who made a meme that you used in one of your videos, specifically the "You're doing it wrong!" meme of a DS Lite with the stylus going through the screen, it was actually pretty cool to hear you talk about this. I was actually one of those people that went "Oh wow, they used it! Awesome!"
When 9 people dislike a video after it's out for 9 seconds, get out, you haven't even watched the video
I wonder Why MAT PAT receives so much Hate for such small mistakes?
First, there was Game Theory.
Then, came Film Theory.
Now, welcome to Life Theory!
tl:dw people are dumb and MatPat explains things for said people
I feel the same way, I like these videos alot. And I had a good name suggestion, but I lost it as soon as I started typing.... I'm too tired perhaps...
I will come back if I remember it though xD
This keeps inspiring me not to make a full-time YouTube channel, but it also causes me to respect you guys even more. Great job guys, I love your videos and hope you keep making them!
Dude if Mat even touched my fanart and i saw it in one of his videos i would have been excited but making a whole scene about it is quite rediculous
WHAT ABOUT THE NEW BENDY!!!!
Just a talk.... a... couch, talk?? 
Hahahaha.
Mad respect for this MatPat!
It‚Äôs just a vlog
A couch vlog
I appreciate this video.
Couch time with Chat-Pat
What kind of artist doesn't sign their work?! I rarely sign my work because it's usually in a notebook with my name on it, and if I like it enough, or I feel it's finished, I will ALWAYS sign  that page because that's what makes the art MINE. It's not that no one else can have, it's just how I connect my art to ME. 
They tell you to sign stuff in every freaking art class ever, partly to know who's it is obvs, but more to get used to it and do it with all your future work. I have a very hard time believing that a lot of the people who make fanart this good were never in an art class.
Not to mention, it doesn't matter where the art comes from, if it's good, it's going to be shared a thousand times over, and if it doesn't have your signiture, no one will see it and think "The person who made this is really talented!" they will, instead, think "Yep, that's a picture of Bonnie."
Good Lord, it's not that hard to just put your initials, your first name, your online handle, ANYTHING, into the corner of an image. Of COURSE MatPat has made the mistake quite a few times, and it doesn't excuse it - but how the hell do you people not understand that, if you don't label it, people won't know it's yours? Do you people turn in all of your homework but are failing because you never put your name on it?
I literally died when you mentioned the "matpat fan fiction"
I DIED
Why are people liking this
Honestly I watch your videos because you actually teach me stuff, I mean you taught me economics from both the Mary Poppins and black panther videos, or psychology in the loot box and addictive game things, hell you taught me legal stuff in the fortnite getting sued videos

So for all the problems with your show, just know that you are doing what school failed to do, get me to learn and get entertained at the same time, I hope you see this so you can realise a whole side of the show, you probably never noticed 

And as someone who watches you for this side of your show, keep up the good work ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I agree, I don‚Äôt watch for each individual theory, I watch for the story and personality, games I know nothing about I still enjoy the episode. Keep up the great work mat pat.
Hey Matpat, I have a completely unrelated question for you. Have you considered what the other two parts of the ring are going to be?
What people are hating on MatPat? Why. He is so down to earth, smart nice and inspiring. He works so hard and goes through so much online abuse and still works harder and harder and now even has green screens and chroma keys, yes people work for him but that really had to happen because researching, editing and actually recording
It's a MatChat.
Pat chat! The name of these videos should be pat chat
Hey MatPat, first I don't blame you for making mistakes. You're human.
Second, I really respect that you don't use any background music when doing you couch talks. It makes it feel more real.
Love these more honest videos of you on the couch just talking about a topic. Please do more :).
7:21
Thank you!! Kirby is always angry in the American box art. üòÇ‚Ä¢ü§£
.
EDIT: Dang, I got popular real quick!! :D
.o. MatPat actually notices us fan editors? Omg thank you so much we're like never noticed ever I feel so appreciated you have no idea
You should know what referencing is and how it is done. Why did you "drop out" of college again?
Fan artiist are some WHINNEY BITCHES I SEE.
It's right wing trolls I've heard....
Honestly I just like game theory because it is a creative way to learn new things, even if it is just random facts
People just get offended at anything now a daysüòê
The box is no excuse, do your research
Why do you always sound like your going to cry in these videos.
Serious theory:    Sans is nes
Little dose of education? Most of the stuff I know I got from this series. You are probably better teacher
9:36.... is... is MatPat (or the editor) a Critter?
This was a good watch, really does help to open my eyes, especially working on my 145 Dark Souls drawings, which I plan on basing them on memes, quotes, scenes, and GIFs (have a few ideas for animations), mainly to help give the characters of the series (including Bloodborne, currently trying to beat at the moment) a more of an understanding about them, but also in a funny way as well.

Maybe a few enemies and bosses here and there, like, if I was to say ‚ÄúSolaire‚Äù, they wouldn‚Äôt know who he is, but if I said ‚Äúthe guy who praises the sun‚Äù, they‚Äôll immediately know who they are, there are those who are too afraid to face death head-on, or really, dying a bunch in a single game, doing this will help to show the characters more, including bits of their story.

Including how the player‚Äôs felt when something happened to the characters (lost Solaire and Eileen and was thrown into a blood frenzy by both events), plus, I can never decide who to draw my character with, but I‚Äôm leaving myself out of this, plus, besides some characters not having a voice, or story, I will also give my take on how they look too.

What I was originally saying before I want off track was, I think I might list the things I used for making these, probably just the titles of the things their based on, including the memes, quotes, GIFs, and scenes, all in brackets too, all and all, Dark Souls, or every Souls series isn‚Äôt about despairs, death, dying and killing, not even the end, I want people to see past that... :)
If there is details wrong in one of these videos. It's okay to acknowledge them and correct matpat. That's not the problem. The problem is the people that personally attack Game Theory whenever there is a mistake in a video.
Lots of citation in this vid
Narcissist.
i like these couch talks.
0:50 yes toads were turned into bricks. But not those type of bricks. According to the Mario canon, the breakable floating bricks are natural object, like trees. The bricks toads are made into are for the castle exteriors
The power of fan art... I got a fan art that was awesome, so awesome in fact i messaged the guy and paid him to make my banner and icon, I love how things like that happen in a community üòçüëè
European legislators: laughs in article 13/17
"Creates art based on copyrighted characters they don't own because of the fair use protections that make this possible"
"Gets mad when a YouTube channel uses those same principals of fair use to feature the fan art briefly onscreen for two seconds"
Should call it The-Real-ry!
You have the hand gestures of the masked magician. 


I like it.
Makes fun of his own For Honor video

Damn, Skall got him good.
Poor Mat
1 like= 1 prayer
This sounds a lot like "Sorry I F*d up, but heres a list of reasons why I'm not a thief. TL:DW 
I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW. But I did. Google said it was cool though so F' you.
You deserve 11M subs.
P.s. "nothing really matter Mortey"
Call these talks chatpats bruh üòÇüòÇ
I‚Äôm actually really happy that you‚Äôve adressed this! I came across an artist who made artwork for an Earthbound mod and ended up having it up on a GT video uncredited. They told me that they were frustrated since they got no response back by tweeting at MatPat. I forwarded the artist your business email, so hopefully it helped!

Also I happened to be one of the artists that Smike took art from. Difference being he asked me personally if he was allowed to use my art and gave me proper credit. Which is something I really appreciate.
BUT THAT‚ÄôS JUST A MAT TALK, A MATPAT TALK! THANKS FOR WATCHING XD
No... The biggest problem facing gametheory is Matt Patt. His crazy theories and bullcrap.
How about and remember thats a Chat a Matt Chat or Pat Chat
Hey, Matpat it's okay sometimes people just want things to complain about. Not because they are actually mad but because they want to rant. Don't be upset okay.
Artists: Makes super accurate recreation / replica of famous character
Person: Uses it in another fan creation
Artists: 'O' That's mine!!!
Think you should've put "Fan Art" in the title, so you make sure those people who complain watch it.

Great video nonetheless ;)
Fun story! I once made a meme that got over 60,000 likes.

On someone else's meme page

The original got under 100
I don't get why people give you so much crap for making mistakes. It's not about making mistakes, it's about how you handle the mistake afterwards.
:)
Awe, people need to pick and whittle down anything on the Youtube scene... it's petty and ridiculous.  MatPat, you've always been very respectful in addressing issues your community and it sucks to see that you even have to put videos like this out because people are being idiots :/.

Your content will naturally change and evolve for every year your channel's existed and some people in the community can choose to grow with you or be an asshole about the changes in content to their personal idea of what that should be.

I've always loved your videos, always will, and to get right down to it your videos (GT Live, Game/Film Theory, etc.) have always put a smile on my face and kept me company through awfully dark times in my life the past couple of years <3.

Thank you for being you, MatPat and thank you for being genuine!

Props to you, man.

...so what youre saying is, you are a mustache twirling villain trying to intentionally steal other peoples creations for his own benefit?
"And remember, that's a fact, a MatChat fact.  Thanks for listening."
and also you can name the show as the "GREEN COUCH"
loving these couch episodes :D
note this is written before I finish watching so i don't know if it's mentioned


Just wanted to throw out that Nintendo unknowing used a fan made sprite of Claus from Mother 3 for his spirit in Smash Brothers Ultimate. A game filled with thousands of assets, should such a small part of a game that is technically stolen be completely taken down just for that one instance? just want people to mull that over.
‚ÄúCouch Talk‚Äù is alright
You should call these kind of videos Met Talk
Honestly the BS like this stuff is why I don't pursue art and why I wright instead it's much less demanding and far easier to be discovered as plagiarized especially if I have all the original drafts with art it's not so easy and it happens in seconds honestly I really agree with his benefit of a doubt at the end because frankly no matter how hard you try your art will be stolen one way or another.
One thing I'd maybe suggest from now on is that with very obviously fan made stuff, you credit the original artist (and going as far as to ask the artist for permission would also be a great idea so they're not blindsighted by it) and for everything else, you can put a little text at the start of the video and/or in the description saying something along the lines of "if I have used any fan made work without credit, please let me know. It was not intentional" to actually make people aware that you're not actively stealing and misusing artwork on purpose. As for the person saying "this is a new low," no. It's a mistake, yes. It was kinda bad, yes. But it's not something that would turn you into a demon.


As for the artists, please be civil. Trust me, you'll get just a bit further if you voice your complaint in a civil manner. Now, a lot of people will be - or at least should be - kind enough to credit you or take it down regardless, but saying "hey, I created this thing that you used and I'd appreciate it if you removed it or credited me" leaves both of you happy and more trusting than saying "hey prick, don't use my art." I mean. You can say that, I guess, but just now the chances of the person you're complaining to not really wanting to cooperate, increases. 


Oh yeah, and Matt. I see a lot of criticism towards you. Some is harsh, some is more politely constructed. You made note that you should have maybe acknowledged how you used fan art and while I can't say for sure whether you do or do not take criticism (either is fine, honestly. As you said, you do this for fun), but if you do, I would also suggest publicly acknowledging said criticism to make people aware that you have in fact read what people have to say and possibly strive to do better. And I know harsh criticism is hard to take, but you don't have to. And since you're the adult here, I'm sure you know the difference between harsh criticism and just blatant insults. Don't take the insults. Just leave with the tips. Or don't, that's not up to me. At least you're not lashing out at your critics, which is vastly preferable. Hope you, as well as everyone else reading this, have a good day
Couch talk
you are right. covers are a big reason people go listen to new songs. same for lets plays.
It's a shame how you have to explain that this is all for fun and the theories shouldn't be taken seriously.
Or, to summarize people: Hanlon's razor. Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
...Well, if we use the term "stupidity" loosely, that is.
This is why I still watch your videos man. Your honest. You admit you use clickbait subjects for videos. You admit the cringe. But it's still fun, because there's still interesting ideas behind the theories, and obvious over analyzation of every facet of a theory. There's a true heart behind this channel, and it's filled with passion. Thank ye, famalam.
6:25
Yeah, how dare you not create the original artist
The "age of outrage" as some would say, people love to hate things
I‚Äôve enjoyed how the gaming videos help me think about games differently, and this is not so different. I‚Äôm really liking these couch talks because it‚Äôs about real life issues, and like game videos, I get to this critically about these topics and grow my knowledge! Thank you!
"i take my work and research very seriously"
literally 2 seconds earlier
"LUIGI'S HOO HAH"
That's why I like memes. No one cares where it originated and who "owns" it. As long as it's good.
People should stop trying to pass their friggin' fan art off as the real thing and people won't rip you off. This is absurd. People don't have time to go and ferret out counterfeit box art from the real and that's not even the point. People are setting traps and then griping when people fall into the trap.
Matpat: Hey, I get the hustle the hardships, here are some suggestions to protect your work

Cheese Bags: Stop victim blaming, I‚Äôm just gonna complain on twitter
"Or the for honor one"
Respect for the awareness there dude. Good on you
its kinda sad since theorists and artists alike both are just trying to do what they love but always get thrown into this drama :c
Call it The Collab-Couch and I'll be happy ‚ò∫
yeah but article 13
I CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THIS AS A REAL PROBLEM .
People need to chill the hell out it‚Äôs just goggle images everybody does this
The sad thing is there are a lot of people who genuinely don't care, though: I've seen people reposting things with the description "credit to the artist" without actually stating who that artist was, and using "someone else reposted it without credit" as their excuse as to why it was okay. I wish people were better at differentiating between someone genuinely trying their best, and someone perpetuating a problem.
Yeah, stealing fan art really hurts the artist.
I mean some people actually steal it and say that they're the ones that made it while the real artist gets bullied for 'stealing' their own art.
But then there's people that just make mistakes without meaning to do anything harmful on purpose.

As long as the ones that do it by accident are informed that they did it, all they have to do is talk to the artist and see what can be done.

'Can I keep this art here if I credit you and maybe post a link to your art blog or website or something?'

'Are you not ok with me keeping it up? I can take it down.'

Ect.

People make honest mistakes.

Just learn to treat them different from the ones that do it on purpose.

The REAL problem is;
Finding the true artist, not a stealer that convinced pretty much everyone.

It feels impossible sometimes.

It's not even just fan art.

Stories?
Essays?
Original art?

So many have been stolen and people have gotten false praise and prizes for it.

And the true artist/writer/whatever gets bullied because people think that they're copying the people that stole their art.

And then the true artist just gets lost in all the lies and stealers and misunderstandings and people that refuse to admit that they're wrong about something that they thought to be true.

'You're the real artist? Well, you have tons of stuff in this exact same fashion and style while the other person doesn't, but...I REFUSE TO ADMIT I WAS WRONG, SO I WILL HARASS AND BULLY YOU AND SPREAD LIES ABOUT YOU FOR EVERYONE TO SEE SO THEY DO IT TOO!'

All the stealers suck.

But all the people that make honest mistakes can be forgiven with just a bit of effort on their part.

They can especially be forgiven by most of the public if they work it out with (hopefully) the real artist.
When I seen the title I said FNAF
Why do people who make fan art get so offended when their art is "stolen" Its not like he took credit for their art. He used it for illustration purposes. Also they dont own the characters and stuff that they're drawing. How is showing an image in a video stealing, but using a character in your art is not?
people who hate the game theorists are looking for a reason to hate him, and they chose fanart....wow
BUT HEY... that‚Äôs just a theory....
Generally things are neglect rather the intended malice, Generally.
Matt Ted talk
call this chatpat we'll be happier
It's STUPID easy to stumble upon fan art that's so convincing, you're convinced it's the real deal.  I understand artists getting mad if their creations get used without credit, but I fully understand it when it's done by accident if the creation LOOKS like the official art instead of having a unique style.
I agree with everything he says sometimes just gets thrown into the Internet and sometimes you‚Äôd be surprised who ends up with your art or even content it‚Äôs hard to blame just one person for things ending up somewhere else where you would rather them be
Matpat: "And that's because before you watch that episode of game theory you should really watch this video"

Me: "Woops"
To be honest I think those people are just a vocal minority, we know you're a good guy MatPat and that nobody is perfect. Wishing you all the support üëç
Also I've seen Mat Chat in the comments for the name suggestion and I totally dig it
I can't speak for everyone, but if I witnessed some of my art on your channel - even without credit - I woulda been pretty flattered. Like "Whoa! I did that!!" Kinda like you mentioned back in the old days.
Still waiting on Top 10 Freddy Fazbear pubic hairs


Also: OC, do not steal.
Make more vlogs plz this was the best vid ive seen from u
good job Matpat, and thanks for the advice as a fan artist, especially for many fandoms, for example, Eddsworld.
that's just a thought.
a couch thought
thx 4 listening
I think MatPat Couch Time would be the best title for these videos lol keep on truckin Game Theorists cause yall get me through the day sometimes and I'll always be behind you!
Having fan art in your channel would be a honor pat
watched the videos the opposite way you said
Could I also ask a favor? Could we as viewers stop being self-righteously outraged on behalf of other people? 'A new low' indeed; if you have time to get bent out of shape over something like this, do yourself a favor: get a hobby, learn a skill, read a book. Thank you!
freddy has  fingermarks above his left eye
That's just a chat.  A MatChat.   Thanks for watching :)
IS  HARD T TELL
Existing
Call it PatChat
All i see in this video is idiots pointing out flaws, just to make mattpatt look bad, dont listen to those haters, keep up the good theories, those haters doesnt even deserve a video!
Call them Couch Talks
Madpat‚Äôs back
Ok, if it's a situation where the image was mislabeled, people shouldn't blame it on you, and the things you said to artists is so true, we should know these things, how to protect our art.
This man truly does speak from the heart when he try‚Äôs to fix or address something, I am almost always gain knowledge and have a different view on him every few years so I sometimes hate and other time love. But when he speaks up I truly have to think ‚ÄúMan, I hated this guy‚Äù He isn‚Äôt perfect and that is why a change because new things happen all the time. So thank you matpat, you truly are the man that makes me reflect
Ok hold on. If you make something that looks identical to the original box art, and someone uses it thinking that its original, and you get mad because someone  uses it...Am I wrong thinking that person is a tool? If I am please set me straight. Sign your work ffs. This is ridiculous and should be a non issue. Its not hard to send a note and say hey man, you used my fan art, can you credit me? Thanks!


Done. But that would require logic and rational thinking.


Sorry you have to address this!
Title: The Real World with MatPat
Mato: It‚Äôs not just a theory, it‚Äôs life.
This is the only really successfully ‚Äúapology‚Äù video. Solid facts and evidence.
Life Theory... Life Talk... THE talk, wait no... Deeper Thoughts, if that's not copyrighted by snl...
For branding these talks i think you should put one on one with matpat
How about... Thoughts From The Couch: Stuff I Go To Therapy For
honestly, i'd love to see MatPat and the Game/Film Theory crew do a podcast where they talk about issues like this that don't quite fit into the film/movies or gaming category! I've been seeing a few people call these type of videos "ChatPat" and I think that'd make for an awesome podcast name!
I never have this problem because....I use my own *art... :-P (*screenshots/thumbnails!)
just call it "IT'S FACTS!"
Theory's were meant to die... It was ok used casually but you over killed it.  After so many people creating channel's of Theory's The word it self died. That's the problem.
i honeslty love these types of videos you're doing more now, and in my opinion i think it'd be better if you /didn't/ "brand" these like you do your other videos because i honestly think that would take away from the whole point of having it being your face and you talking to us on the couch.  I think it would kind of take away from the more personal aspect that you're trying to accomplish when doing these types of vids in the first place sooo-  yeah, honestly i think it'd work better if you just left it at smth simple like "that's all i wanted to say for today, thanks for watching" or smth like that.  doesn't have to be fancy or in that signature matpat "AAAND REMEMBER! THAATT'S JUST A THEORY!" voice either.  cuz again that could take away from the more serious and personal tone you're aiming for in the first place.  idk just a thought. 

but i do wanna say one more time that i love these vids and seeing your thoughts play out in this kind of format, it's actually really cool!  Anywho love your work and thanks for the tips I'll try to remember the watermark thing on my art next time i draw :)
Couch Session, maybe?
I personally don't see a problem, but then again, i'm not in that position to understand what it's like on both ends.
Some people really taking theories too seriously. Theories are letting us look to the games from another perspectives, it's meant for fun. 
If you ask me my opinion, I'm really having fun watching theory videos, also there's some cases like Petscop or DDLC that has stuff more than just theories or speculations, I'm really enjoying this kind of videos at most. So keep it up MatPat, you're doing a great job.
But that's just a theory. A couch theory!
This guy is scummy he buys the theories for next to nothing and hires an animator and just parrots over do not support this npc
Listen. Matpat is not an art thief. I've dealt with an art thief, which then turned into an ip-address thief. I'm not a huge GT fan, but Matpat isn't malicious. 

now, y'all can say 'well but he's smart! this could all be a PR stunt to get us on his side!' and if you really want to make excuses for the fact that his employees would also have to be in the know, well gosh dang, you're probably great at parties, Alex Jones!

Everybody needs to take a step back and chill. We're the internet. We love to make fun of crazy people who act irrationally about things, like entitled parents and whatnot. But if you rip somebody to shreds for a genuine mistake, you really aren't any better. Just think about things from everybody's POV before you go in guns blazing
Are people forgetting that his outro is literally 
"But that's just a theory...a game theory!" 


Here is one of the definitions of a theory: 
"Phrases
in theory ‚Äî used in describing what is supposed to happen or be possible, usually with the implication that it does not in fact happen."
I don't understand why The Game Theorist's gets so much hate.
I will always give you guys the benefit of the doubt. Thanks for all you do. I really enjoy your work and your videos and puns always make me smile and laugh. Love you guys. Thanks again.
Animator/Artist: Makes piece of art/a character.

Fan-artist: You stole my art since you didn't credit me!

Animator/Artist: Am I a joke to you?
Lmao, I didn't really believe "matiplier" was a thing so I looked it up on Wattpad and it said there was 666 stories, I screenshoted that lol
1 call these "couch talks" "matchats" lol

2 I already have watched it I got that notification this morning lol
You could call it "The Crying Couch". 2/3 of these that I've seen involve some tears being shed at some point.
If someone would use my art I would cry and say thx so much but plz credit.
I never thought that you would act like those people are assuming it, but I really like that you're talking about it and explaining the issue. It shows that you take all of this serious.
And I like the story about how the relationship between fanartists and youtubers was back then. I'm not a fanartist, but I always thought like you just told it. "If I was a fanartist I'd be happy to see someone using it."

Continue doing this Chat-Pat-videos. It's really nice :)
I hated you because of your tf2 vidoe
Try calling them a "Mat Chat"
Edit: For any fan artists in the comment section. This is my mini-rant. 

Realistically, I think it's more about making sure your name is attached to the art. As an artist, I can understand that some people get really snippy when their art is used without permission. But the thing is, these characters aren't yours. They aren't OCs. It is FAN ART.  And not your character. Granted, you should always want credit for your work. But in order to make sure people KNOW it was stolen, you need your name on it. 

Also, you need to NOT shout at the people using it. Ask them to update the description or something, not take the entire video down. Or scream at them for no reason. IF they didn't credit in the description, THEN you can say something. Otherwise, CHECK before you explode at people for no reason. Because odds are, they didn't know. 


(Note: if they are selling your work without permission, then by all means. Rip them a new butthole.)
Dude this had to be annoying to deal with and make a video about. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting some flake about this. I‚Äôve watched you for years, since you first started your channel (my favorite was the one with the watermelon, very early video but it was awesome) keep going my man.
HOW TO BRAND THESE EPISODES: ChatPat
call it a: MatPat stuff rant ;)
Glad you made this Mat, it definitely helped explain some stuff! For the record, I LOVE your videos. I don't care if there's loops in the theories, that's the point, it's a theory and just as you said, it's FUN to think about. My siblings and I listen to these theories and try to just freak each other out with them XD People just don't know how to just ENJOY something anymore, smh.. Please keep doing what you're doing, love ya man..
too long didnt watch
I feel bad for matpat he has dealt with so many things and these mean people are just looking for something to complain about

Mean people: "I'm bored.... I'm gonna just complain about some stupid picture!"
‚ÄúA new low‚Äù bruh
Fanart, by it's nature, is copying someone else's intellectual property, yet they claim the moral high ground here? I'm so confused.

By all means, credit where it's due for making something cool. But I wonder how many fan-artists actually credit who they are effectively stealing content from. I know some do, but having been around the internet a few times, I rarely see bowsette art crediting Nintendo or whoever originally designed Bowser. Frankly, it's just assumed, because we tend to recognize the IP - but as we grow as a society and content continues to diversify into niche markets, there are times where I encounter fanart I don't know what it's based on. And guess what? They didn't credit anyone else.  Their work is 'original'.

I'm not excusing anyone here, just pointing out that this is a bit of a kettle calling the pot black, only at least the pot is making a good faith effort attempt at not being malicious. 

At the end of the day, while credit does matter a little bit in terms of personal success, it's not that important. The human race is built off the ideas of those who came before. Edison. Tesla. Einstein. Hawking. All those ideas, all that knowledge, we still regularly use. Do we credit Edison for every lightbulb or battery? Tesla for every AC circuit in every house? 

If we had to credit the ideas of everything that came before, it would be a laundry list of names on everything ever produced.

It's pretty insane to me that some artist might be upset that the FNAF creator is getting credit for said artists copying of the FNAF character in the first place, but slightly rounding it's nose, thus making it 'different and iterative.'
Maybe brand these "A chat with Matpat"

As a fan artist myself, please know that some of us have always given you the benefit of the doubt.
Hi, Matpat, this will probably get lost in a sea of comments, but I thought I'd try to post a reply anyway. As an artist for a pretty popular fandom, I have a decent amount of followers on my non-private art accounts on tumblr/twitter. To make a long story short,  have a lot of experience having my art stolen for one purpose or another. First of all; most artists sign their art, and many watermark their art like you suggested (though I've had a LOT of people telling me that it's "ugly" and how they wish that I wouldn't. They complain that it ruins their "immersion")  Some artists write in the description of every single post they make that they don't want anyone reposting their art anywhere, yet it still happens.

Instagram users are NOTORIOUS for doing it, since there's no "reblog/retweet" feature. Instagram/twitter/facebook accounts with MILLIONS of followers repost art to their accounts - I've even had some people go as far as to cut my watermark and my signature out of my drawings. I've had times where I've had a repost of my art get 5k+ likes/retweets on  picture repost twitters, while it only has a couple of hundred on my own twitter. It really, really sucks. 

There was even once (when I was still very new to uploading art and I uploaded art in high resolution) where someone had cut my watermark and my signature out of the image and was using my art for merch such as t-shirts, mousepads and notebooks. I had no idea about it until one of my followers saw it and alerted me to it. And even then, when I got in contact with the seller, they weren't very helpful or willing to take the merch down.

Same thing happened when Jeffree Star - the art used in some of his products was stolen and the signature/watermark was removed. (Though to his credit, he was blameless in this and handled it very well)

Basically, what I'm trying to tell you is: I 100% believe you when you say that you don't mean to repost fanworks without credit, and I think you handle it well when you accidentally do so. However, as someone who had been in various fan-communities for 15 years now, it's just as difficult for artists to know what happens to their creations after it's posted.


Have a look at Laura Price
's youtube channel - she just posted a video of herself explaining why it's so damaging for artists to have their art reposted. She's a professional concept artist working on big titles like the Tangled series.


Keep up the great work, and keep doing you <3
*reads title*

You mean posting too many fnaf videos?
Dude you are human 
You are going to make mistakes as are the people in your employ.
I would be jumping with excitement to see my fanart in one of you're videos,
screw linking it, just happy you found it good enough as an example....have a pancake
Oh, my bad. I thought he was going to be talking about Game of Thrones! 
This was me trying to understand what he's talking about 3 minutes in.  O_o
I love how people in the comments discourage hate against MatPat...but do encourage hate against someone who calls him out for a mistake he made. You're all such great people and totally are worth the resect you gain from people replying to you.
Me: * draws minecraft fan characters *
Me: "I guess I am save. Pf."
It's a Theory's Honest Talk, (TM) Just kidding, use it
Oh...
I thought this was going to be about how you just keep making fnaf videos and are ruining out of ideas...
But sure, we'll go with the art thing. 
Credit them, problem solved. 
But seriously, make some thing other than FNAF, take a break from it man.

Story Couch üõã
Good on you for addressing this.
I mean it was an honest mistake. I totally get that. But I also see sort of a problem when fan artists go too far in trying to convince people what they created is real. That's a line that certain artists cross. I do think you are genuine in your apology and want to do better, and that's respectable.

Also if I could address the elephant in the comments. A user by the name of The One Formerly Known....here's the thing. I've talked to him privately in the past after an argument we had in the past. This is..sort of what he does. He challenges peoples views. He makes it pretty clear at least to me that he does this specifically to spark debate, wanting to see how open-minded people are regarding opposing view stances. One thing I never respected about him is...his mannerisms in doing so. He feels the need to call people out on their stupidity. And while..i see it being justified in a couple of his responses, most aren't. He takes these things way too seriously and OFK, if you see this, chill out. You're dealing with a very large fanbase. You don't want to dig this hole for yourself.
Like its not that good that you guys "Steal" art and stuff but i think its amasing that you come clean and tell everyone that you "stole" it :) keep goin!
As a independent game artist, you have to watermark your art especially if its fan art. If you don't, the artist can't get mad if someone uses it or even claims it as their own. That is how big companies do it and that's how every artist should approach their art. If you are proud of your art, watermark it and put your name on it. 

Don't feel bad MatPat. You're in a situation when a proffesional deals with the unprofessional. That is not a slam to the artists that make fan art but most of them dont understand how copyright works. Why Disney is the biggest abuser of copyright and intellectual property. 

Love your stuff. Keep on keeping on.
As a video editor and creator myself, I can 100% relate to this. I'm one of Lockstin & Gnoggin's editors, and the amount of images we need to use in every video becomes a shockingly long list. At one point, I used about 200 unique images in just one single 6 minute video. Imagine the amount of time you need to dedicate to find the images you need to this amount, while also making sure that every single one of them is safe to use while trying to stay on track of a deadline that must be met for the video to be ready to go Live. With such a huge amount of extremely convincing fan art out there that looks extremely official, these mistakes can easily slip through the cracks, and there have been a few occasions where Lockstin contacted me to let me know I accidentally used fan art that I thought was official art, because it was so convincing. It's incredible how good this art can be, and I have a lot of respect for anyone who creates it, your work is outstanding. Us editors are in a constant search around the internet for images that we need and are safe to use. Please try not to get too upset if we screw up, we're doing our best, but we're only human, we make mistakes.

To all artists out there, you guys are incredible, and if us editors screw up, we're sorry. <3
Any respectable fanfiction writer uses Achieve of Our Own. Jkjk. Lot of writers start on Wattpad. It‚Äôs just Ao3 is a lot more user and viewer friendly. Being able to tag your work is a blessing. And give it a rating. Archive warnings for triggering material. It‚Äôs great for both the reader and the writer.
Hats off to you for transparency, MatPat.
I realize now how easy it is to accidentally use someone else‚Äôs work without meaning to. I don‚Äôt understand how people can hate matpat. Not only did he apologize and explained everything so well, but he‚Äôs also trying to help artist by giving them very helpful tips on how to protect their work. You can tell he‚Äôs being genuine and I really appreciate these types of videos.
What's crazy is that even watermarks dont work sometimes.

I have seen where people actually slap THEIR OWN WATERMARK over someone else's. Sad.
Well done Matpat!! I‚Äôm really proud of you, and I definitely support you! I‚Äôm sorry that some people see this as malicious intent. I‚Äôm an artist myself, so I know some of the hard ships that come with posting online. 
I love your videos and would never hold something like that against you.
16:20 ok can we now make a petition to change the community name from ‚Äútheorists‚Äù to ‚ÄúMatt‚Äôs brats‚Äù idk that part cracked me up XD


(also as a side note I love how Matiplier (idk what it‚Äôs called) was used for the main ship  )

I dunno, lol.

It's crazy to think someone flipped their lid over fan art in a YouTube video but not when Nintendo accidentally used fanart for a Spirit in Smash Ultimate. 

(Its been patched out since and the Spirit was Masked Man if your wondering.)

MatPat, you are the best!
You are always entertaining and educational, and I know you are an honest guy.
Keep it up, don't beat yourself up, and don't listen to petty trolls.
You're awesome!
Personally, I love these videos. I love seeing your honest and sincerest moments during your talk times and hope to keep seeing more of this.

As for a name, I like the idea of "Minutes/Moments with Matt" because it's not just Matpat, the YouTuber, speaking to us, it's you speaking from the heart.
For these couch episodes, you could call it "Couching the issue." After all, one of the definitions of couch is as a verb and literally just means exactly what you're doing. "verb (used with object)
to arrange or frame (words, a sentence, etc.); put into words; express: 

a simple request couched in respectful language."


Just an idea. There's probably better ideas though.
Can we call these videos "MatPat Chat Time"?
The day someone accidentally uses my crappy (way off-model) fanart in a non-art video, anger would probably be my last emotion.
About the water mark. There are images I made that gets taken regardless. I always put it on the bottom left and it gets cropped out by the taker.


And I would water mark it in the middle of the picture like a stock photo but it makes the creation ugly. It ruins it and comes off as pretentious.


No solution is perfect but its stuff I look at when creating.

I use Wattpad, I really just use it for my own art. call Wattpad, Wattpad ( wat* sounds like mat with a w * pad)
Hey it‚Äôs okay! You learned something and decided to share it with us so that we can avoid this mistake.
Matt, you need to start officially doing couch theories. I have found myself enjoying your ranting more than some of your recent theories. 

More!
This is why I don't get Fan arts who get triggered over this: They need to leave a mark on their stuff that definitively shows them as the creator (whether it be their signature, (c) you, etc).
"But this is just a couch chat, a ChatPat/MatPat couch chat. And don't forget to keep the chatting going"
Any suggestions of changing any line please comment it below.
a lot of the reasons you brought up is really the reason why I decided not to make a YouTube channel.
Props to you for addressing this, man,
Mad props ü§ü
Thank you for the advice! As someone who is both an artist and a college student studying information, I find myself thinking about the struggle artists have with protecting their works, how to properly credit or cite references (written, drawn, created, etc.) online, and what can be done by the creators and the users to fix these issue. Anyways, very insightful video.
BUT HEY, THAT'S JUST A TALK, A COUCH TALK, getting comfy
Matpat's Fireside Chats 2k19
really enjoying these little "behind the theory" couch talks. keep up the hard work!
If artists don't bother watermarking or signing their art they're consenting unrestricted third-party use.

While giving credit to those artists is a nice move it's not required, not when they gave full permission to everyone to use it.

If artists want to take credit for their work they'd be signing it at least.
Why should anyone respect what the original creator did not?
PETITION FOR MATPAT TO GROW A VILLAIN MUSTACHE!!!!
Thank you!!! As a both writer and artist I understand how frustrating how sometimes things get stolen but its understandable at some times. That's why I don't make art with very similar originals. Make art with your name and watermark. In the art community we need to not react so harshly when it happens, and just understand when it happens.
Earlier this day I saw a post by someone "explaining" how reposts hurt the original creator, and the one difference I could find is that the amounts of views and likes were higher on the fanpage repost than on the original.
I smirked.
While art should be signed and people should credit, there'd still be an enormous difference in view and like count.
Usually fanpages have this gimmick going on which makes them very likeable and accessible to the public. At the end of the day the artists won't get the recognition they'd like. Which is sad. But so is harassment. Talk first, point later.
Mats casting couch
I love ‚ÄúCouch Talks with MatPat‚Äù. They are my second favorite series on this channel. The FNAF series is my favorite. I am a huge coward so there was no way for me to play them. Then I saw you explain all the little clues and lore. I felt like it was a way I could enjoy the games without nightmares. Thank you for all your hard work over the years. It is deeply appreciated.
Fanart has hit a new high
I love this heart-to-heart talks, MatPat! But man, haters gonna hate hate hate! Just focus on your truly supporting community and don't listen to those people who just have no CLUE what it takes to create these videos. Just the other day I was trying to subtitle one of your videos, man, I had no idea how hard it would be. I'm trying to say, people love to talk smack about things they don't understand, and there's no reason for it, it's just that, they don't understand, the saddest part is that they don't care about understanding either, they just care about lashing out whatever hate they have built up inside for some reason. The work you guys do is AMAZING and I love all you content, I hope it never changes ‚ô• Love you guys, keep it up! ‚ô•
That's just a theory.
Even though you're not my dad, I thank you for taking care of us all here. Gamer Dad MatPat teaching us about integrity, respect and responsibility in our ever growing internet world. 


Know that in every angry email you receive, there are hundreds of unsent thank you emails because we hope it's not a boring echo of what you should already know and that's "Thanks for all the good content you guys do!"
Call it: Chit chat with MattPatt xD
I always appreciate your honestly and transparency. These talks are sometimes interesting, sometimes boring or frustrating, but always really good. Keep it important, keep it real, and keep them coming but only when needed and able. 

You guys rock it!
For example, Youtuber Thomas Sanders. He has on Instagram every Sunday. Credited fanart images of his characters and he is proud of every single one
But fan art is using someone else ideas without their permission? The internet needs to chill (and i make fan art)
12:08 Useful tips for using image in your work.

copyright are getting out of hand...
people are getting WAY too mad because of it


im looking at you, Europe.
17:37 i‚Äôm only human after all don‚Äôt put the blame on me 

Also 18:04 FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOOM!!
This is a great video MatPat, I‚Äôm so glad you can stick up for yourself, keep it up!
And that's just a rant, a couch rant.
More reasons why not to become a YouTuber. sigh :(
Ok after MatPat said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not some mustache twirling villain...‚Äù 

ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF MATPAT WITH A VILLAIN MUSTACHE LETS HAVE A PETITION!!! 
Mustache time MatPat !!!
How about you call these sorts of videos Fan Talks, maybe could even bring in some other people to have actual discussions with.

That all said, Role Playing Games occupy a strange space in gaming, I'm sure you could do quite a few videos on that.
Call it matpats a couch venting
mat chat
Love ya!
Matt Chatt
There goes YouTube, 18 likes and 6 views
Thing is, it's not youtube guys I worry on with (accidental) stolen art, it's more that t-shirt/mug/etc makers who actually get money directly who pull that art theft crap. Since also, that usually is not accidental.
MatPat: Uses Fanart

Mad Artist: Wait, that‚Äôs illegal
Thoughts with matpat
I agree that art is constantly stolen and isn't credited, and it should stop immediately. In cases like these though, it was on accident, and that should be okay. When that happens, the creator either does two things, makes sure the artist is still okay with it and credits it, or continues without changing anything. The 2nd thing is obviously the wrong desicion. I agree that people using art without crediting the artist should be stopped.
17:36 no. You're a human, but you're not ONLY human. You're a hero, MatPat. In my opinion, you are. And i'm preeeeetty sure i'm not the only one.
I don‚Äôt know how you do it. The level commitment and the attention to detail you put into your channel and videos, I would say, rivals that Scott Cawthon or even Disney. This video and the one that follows this has inspired me to devote the same level of caution and respect in my channel‚Äôs videos, thumbnails etc. 

Thank you for what you do, for bringing us entertaining videos that we don‚Äôt feel bad for binging, that make us think differently or see something or someone in a different light. Thank you for putting so much passion into what you do and for always being so humble and relatable.

Please don‚Äôt ever stop :)
Haha ppl are retarted or trolls
Matpat's editors don't know every image on the internet complete with sources and creators .... pppffff unsub
Thank you for Addressing this MatPat, because people need to be more aware than just flying off the handle because someone made the mistake of not sourcing the image. 

Also I disagree on the little educational. I built an entire Strength/Weakness chart for Sound Pokemon thanks to your video on sound.
I feel bad for you but me and thousands of thousands of other people have been here for a long time and we will stayüòÄThank you for all of you vids love you dudeüíõüíöüíúüíùüíô‚ù§üíóüíñüíïüíìüíòüíü‚ù£üíå
"Thats a chat, a matt/pat chat" could work.
damn i forgot smike oof
id shart myself if someone else used my art as a reference to a topic like in any matpat video, i dont understand how artist get so butthurt over an honest mistake of someones art being mistaken for official art
@The Game Theorists - I love tuning into your "MatChat" episodes. We learn a ton of this info in Digital Marketing when we look into creating quick and easy student ads for the Google ad challenge. You just did a great job articulating so much of the info we learned there in this episode.
I like the couch talks :)
Give the guy a break
I know YouTube has a duration algorithm or something, but these episodes are too long-winded to be enjoyable for me. I mean I don't have the best attention span and I'm a busy college student, so might just be me. But still.
It's amazing that you can both clearly show how it is an easily made, justifiable mistake to make - 
...and yet also act as though you feel like what you did is as bad as murder.

Make up your mind. Is this a pity-party apology video, or a "get over it you idiots" video. Because it SHOULD be the latter.

I know you try to make these talking on the couch videos more personal and serious, but in all reality they just feel a lot more fake. Like - these are your PR videos
Matpat you should brand these talks as a new channel or something easy to differentiate.  These talks aren't strict to game theory or film theory, so having a channel like "Couch Theory" or "Youtube Theory" would be cool
Don't steal ma stealing...  IE: The Disney model
I‚Äôm a simple man.
I see him and his couch on the thumbnail.
I click.


Edit: and thx for the likes lul
ppl need to stop getting angry about theories, they're theories.it's all in good fun.
I love listening to matpat's voice


Idk if that's really weird... But like....
Going thru thousands of images can make you lose track after awhile. Having vague credits also doesnt help. At least you did your best, mat
It just seems like it's something that's bound to happen no matter how hard you try to not have this happen
Welp, this video was a waste of time
AND REMEMBER, THIS IS JUST A POTATO...

A COUCH POTATO!!!




Thanks for watching.
Mid-tier Influencer... Pfft. Love your Real Talk MatPat. In my heart you will always be Top-Tier Influencer.
I like these couch talks. They have a GT feel because it's MatPat in educator mode, but they feel more personal, more focused and more current.
Hey how about? "My two cents." "Matt Packs two cents!"
9:35 They used a piece from WendyDoodles! So... which GT member is a Critter??
What if this is April fools
ü§îü§® why aren't fan artists signing there work isn't that the hole point of a signature so that you can get credit for your work and no one would steal it from you?
why do i feel like these are the videos i see on game theory now lol
And that‚Äôs:
Taking it seriously, very seriously and cut
Series name idea: CHATPAT
it should be: And remember thats just a Chat, a mat chat
I still dont get it. even if its not the original character arent we all able to distinguish who is who? even if theres a difference in design.
what has happend to all the fair use laws?
Couch Chat with MatPat!
Who here used to watch smike.
I can already smell a few [not all, obviously] fan art purposely made to be baiting use from youtubers like Matt, trying to look as close to the original content as possible.  This Way, they can strike him up after not using their stuff fairly.  Gain attention out of it too.  Think about it.  Please, I beg, don't abuse Matt's patience in trying yo fix things.
Damn it Matt. You're supposed to entertain me! Not make me learn stuff!!!





Though this video was utterly fascinating so I couldn't bring myself to X out. Well played, good sir. Well played.
Who disliked? He literally just said that he would never intentionally hurt creaters. Oh How horrible of him
Cry more
Intro: "Sure I know there are some theories that are going to be controversial"

My Brain: Persona, PERSONA!
Man MatPats knows how to hit you with the feels, about literally anything...
why do fan artists care about people crediting their work, NO-ONE actually reads these.
The problem is:
You're putting math and science for the backside and turning the show into a "kids show". In my opinion, that's what lead to the show to lose it's essence, becoming a numbers showcase instead of what it was always supposed to be: about videogames+science.

                                                 Sincerely, klaux.
In the meantime remember. Its a talk. A smalltalk, thanks for watching.

I think that would fit well ^^
I love you all at GT. Been here since the early days and I don‚Äôt think you are doing anything other than trying your best.
PHEW I though this would be about article 13...
#MatChat. Let's get that one trending.
You can call it "Mat Chats"
no matter what we are always on your side matpat
And that's just a check, a fact check! Thanks for watching!
You should call them ‚Äúhear me‚Äôs‚Äù or something of the sort
So you basically google search and take the first images that show up even if the original ones are there?
I love this man (no homo)
Personally I think this is an easy fix. If artist just placed some identifier or watermark on their art so it is self crediting this problem could be avoided. If this were somehow enforced then fan artist who refuse to give themselves credit are to blame really. It sad that people can‚Äôt just be happy they their art was featured on a video for about 2 seconds.

You seem like you're going to breakdown and cry at any moment I would hope that you're not , but the levels of emoting are seriously off the charts. Did you happen to grow up in a Methodist home?
Couch Chat With Mat Pat.
As someone who had pumped out a few pieces of art on the internet, both, heh, "original" AND fanart, I feel that whenever I publish some fanart, I understand the nature of it: at the core, the character is not mine. I get that the art idea is mine, but I don't go pell-nell in guarding it. I am borrowing another character that I had no part of creating in my picture.
ITS DA CHATPAT
i just love watching the videos because its entertaining not that if ness really is sans
I guess people stopped using the old disclaimer that we used when writing fan fiction and drawing fan art. 

If you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about look up the incident about Anne Rice suing her fans for writing fan fiction
But that's just a chat, *A MAT CHAT*. Thanks for listening.
Who else likes MatPat talk time
if i didn t watch the two channels i will never be able to answer some questions my teacher.MATPATYOU ARE MY best and favourite  YOUTUBER TEACHER  give that baby a hug and tell steph i said hi :)
That's just a talk a talk on life
What about the fact you steal fan theories
But HEY!! That‚Äôs just a soliloquy...
thank you.
It‚Äôs just a chat a matchat  and cut
Steal fanart? What a load of BS. He's never come off saying the artwork is his. The whole bitching about fanart it stupid. Nobody comes here for the fanart, the visuals are nice, they help convey what's being said, perhaps to make it more understandable, or just to amuse, but they're not the draw. The Draw, why people come here is for the Theories. For the length of Luigi's Italian Sausage, For how Mario is a dirty Commie, For the meaning behind the Fan in FNAF. Clips from the games, box art, artistic expressions themselves, Matpat's head exploding in the old intro, that's all well and good, and make for a good watch, but again, they're not the draw.

 People seem to get on this bandwagon now and again, trying to drag Game Theory down, accusing Matpat of this or that, or suggesting that the channel has 'reached a new low'. Compared to what? Sure sure, removing the fanart may remove some sort of legal issues, but then so is removing game music, what about official art? What if companies pull that too? Just have to go to a podcast version or no visuals. People are complaining about things that either don't involve them, complaining for the sake of complaining, or complaining in an attempt to try and ruin something for the rest of us. 

This whole complaining is stupid. Everyone else should just shut it and let them make vids.
Honestly I didnt need to hear anymore past the googling nonsense. It is VERY hard to tell fanart apart from the real things sometimes. Its not anything against the artist, it's just super hard for the artist to get credited unless they locked it to a website airtight as if that could ever happen.

Bottom line: If you post ANYTHING on the internet. You are the source; but you can't expect it to not be shared, reposted, plastered somewhere else- because you can't control the internet. And trying to control someone else legally for a mistake is just showing how little you understand of how loose the internet really is.
Chat theory
thank you
So that's what happened to Smike... Sad.
Most of these fan arts look almost exactly like the actual characters.   The actual creators themselves could easily get most of that art pulled.   This money issue with  fan art seems overly critical.
Holy crap dude I was thinking about smike before he mentioned him because I remember him reuploading videos saying it's them without fan art
MatPat‚Äôs Couch Chat
I think this is a great example why Article 13 (now 17) won't work. It's IMPOSSIBLE to enforce without simply stopping providing service to EU. Speaking of which, can you do an in-depth real life theory on the effects of the article will have, or rather the undesired side effects?
Matpat‚Äôs pad talks
Mat, you and Steph need a break. Also, thank you for doing these videos for the past 8 years!
This episode tldr; CONTEXT and PERSPECTIVE
I would be honnored if he used any of my fam art. Wouldnt mind not being credited. ^~^
Spamming the comments section for Matpat's username on Wattpad


Jk.


Can you adopt me on Wattpad tho?
this sitdown style of video has by far become my favorite thing matpat has done
I might not watch Game Theory as I much as I did 3 or 4 years ago, but this sort of honesty and work ethic is something I really like about this channel.
U should call these things mat patches
If My Fanart was used in any channel I would be "Stoked"!!! Ppl it's FREE PUBLICITY!!
everyone, stop hating on this sweet man. can't you see how hard he tries?
just call these couch talks lmao
m u s t a c h e   t w i r l i n g
i agree with signing your work, but i horrendously disagree with watermarks. I personally would never put a watermark on any art i made that wasn't a commission (such as showing a demo of something before its done and paid for), id rather all of my art be stolen and used without credit than deface the art itself. ill state this here and now, if i ever make any art anyone likes, you are 100% welcome to use it in any fashion you wish. signing the art is fine, but don't deface it with a watermark
Why always when u make a video like this you sound like youre about to cry?
Call it a couch theory
Matpat couch time
To be completely honest if matpat showed of some of my fan art I would be so proud and happy
Dude.... Matt..... you are freaking awesome broseph. Keep up the amazing and entertaining content. 

Oh, and side note: Forget the haters and keep doing the great work you've always done. Your true fans know none of this was done with malicious intent.

üòÅü§ô
I always love how serious you take everything. Even small issues are incredibly important to you, and that's one thing I love about this channel.
I learned something when going to school, if you want credit for something.... PUT YOUR NAME ON IT!!!
*Sees mats serious face
This is a twisted April fool's prank
"Game Theory - The TRUTH About Sans?!". That's the biggest problem with this channel.
This has been your friendly neighbourhood MatChat.
If someone would use my art I wouldn't really care as much.
I just finished the video and asked myself "why did I watch this? This doesn't effect me..." XD
This youtube video is worded and constructed as a collegiate level essay.
Truth talk with MatPat or Real talk with MatPat
The only brand that i know who was actively working with fans and being cool about the different iterations was hasbro with its my little pony franchise.
Their was a lot of really cool ideas that saw the light of day because of this.
Wish we could see that same level of understanding in other companies.
i really like these personal talks
I'm partial to calling it a "PatChat".
Love you Matt!!!!
Yeah, anyone who's been on the internet for any period of time should know that sourcing content and distinguishing it is a herculean task. You literally have billions of people in what can be described as neural networks creating, referencing, re-imagining works to the point that the archaic ideas of copy-right barely hold sway. It's becoming increasingly difficult to tell where one persons ideas begin and another's end. We live in such a connected way, influence by so many others that the saying "nothing is original under the sun" becomes closer and closer to the truth. I can see why a person could grab fan art and never realize it. A lot of fan art is of exceptional, professional quality and a part of the process of making this kind of fan art is in making it indistinguishable from the genuine article.
It's a couch chat ..... MatChat ... getting real with the MatPat
I still felt you should just not do like just your pic... And cause I'm scared of lag...
borrow the art
You  should make a third channel called MatPat Talktime
Wrong. GT only problem is not finishing up second part of mass effect indoctrination theory
You can call this segment:

CHIT CHAT WITH MATPAT
You my boy Matt, anyone who knows you and the channel sees those lengths, and it might sound cheesy but you've one of the best moral compasses I see on the site, often the first I hear about an issue with the channel is from you. Keep it up my man.
Biggest problem is videos like this
If someone's "fan art" is so close to the original that it can't be easily distinguished, that is essentially copyright infringement on their part. And the idea that they think they deserve some sort of credit for that honestly kinda blows my mind.
If he published this the next day no one would take him seriously...


Edit:Thanks for the likes btw 

Other edit:OMG STOP CORRECTING ME THIS COMMENT WAS JUST A JOKE DEAR GOD
It‚Äôs just a CHAT 
WITH MATPAT 
THANKS FOR WATCHING
Congrats on having a family and getting to this point. But article 13.
Honestly if Matpat stole all my art I wouldn‚Äôt care, he could use it all he wanted
Sigh.  Aw, come on.  The outrage hobbyists need to calm the &^%& down about innocent mistakes.  If you're going to post artwork that looks almost identical to the original IP, then yeah, this is gonna happen.
It is you trying to stretch 5-10 minutes to 20...
I miss your old content.
Sounds like you wanna keep the channel safe when article 13 kicks in
Theory Talk and make the color Blue since you already have red and green.
Ay it's Smike!
Honestly Matpat, I feel like I learned so much as an artist from this. Thank you for this video, it really spreads a good wealth of awareness for artists who put so much work into their own pieces.
Ngl as an artist,  very much like music I‚Äôd love my art to get attention from media and even better from game companies but if my art has been used because I‚Äôve uploaded it without a watermark or without main specification that it‚Äôs not the actual game model it‚Äôs kind of fair game especially if my model is literally next to an exact copy of the original game art plus even for my artwork when I make fan models of games due to copyright I need to give credit to any concepts/ close inspirations that I use so that I don‚Äôt get sued 

I‚Äôm probably confused by most of the topic I‚Äôm not great with this topic 

But like matpat says to sign the work, water mark it and upload it to a site with good terms and conditions e.g ArtStation, luckily for me I have a student version of 3dsmax so if a company did use my model it‚Äôs already watermarked by Autodesk as a student version model and can sue the user of money is made of it
But that's just a rant. A couch rant! Thanks for listening.
6 min in and what I hear is "So we did some slip ups but he who made FNAF couldnt even see ONE picture was fan made, when we have ti do that for so much footage for soo many videos!" I understand, but idk thats what I hear. Not saying its less or more OK for neither of them to do that, basically steal fantart. But I understand and youve admitted your error.
I'm late
As someone who wants to start on YouTube I‚Äôll definitely take some notes from this video. Thanks MatPat! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I have watched that episode!! üòÇ but I think you should call them MatChats or Beyond the videos with MatPat or something Like that
Welcome to CouchTheory 
Story time with CouchPat
MatPats CouchChatt thanks for watching
I really hope many people that hate your channel for the reasons that you described in this video watch this video, I really love your channel MatPat! I am your supporter all the way! And also...






lol
What about calling it "Couch Talk"? That way it's a pritty blank canvas for everytime you want to have a talk.
I love this honest video, mat your such a great guy its sad to see people so upset over mistakes like that :/
There really isnt an excuse for when artists make fanart this ambiguous. In my oppinion, you would need to do so INTENTIONALLY for fanart to be this hard to recognize. Seriously, if you want credit for your work it's not hard to put a watermark in the corner or something
Matpat recently is tired of the haters' sh**
Dunno what you're doing, but you look more handsome than ever! :) <3 oh, yeah.. the video.. what was I saying? Yeah! This is as good as always! You know what you're doing ^_^. Keep up the good work!
I honestly don‚Äôt care about this fan art I just love watching your videoüëç
After the first minute I realized this is why your one of my favorite Youtubersüòå‚ù§
He's talking about the how to train your dragon Theory...
Oof it is good that you are personally talking about these sorts of things 
#goodmatpat
Gatcha games = hell proof: play gatcha games
Thank you MatPat :3
#matchat
I really don't understand the issue...
If you(matpat) would use sommething I created, a fan art, an animation created by fan or anything like this... I would have be really thankful for it, regardless if you add my name and all... the idea of something I created was appropriated by someone is something really cool... And if I would ask for credit for something I created I would just calmly ask you if you could add my name/nickname and all...
I don't support taking credit for something created by others, But if something you worked hard on is being appriciated by big time youtubers and others.... to the point you can't see the difference between the original to a version you created... That is amazing... No reason whatsoever to get mad of, and as I said, instead of being rageful or accusing him, just ask them to add your name by the side, or add the link where they find it in the description below...
personally don‚Äôt watch matpat, but I appreciate this video. never saw it from this perspective. i really admire matt‚Äôs honesty and integrity.
Try searching "FNAF game files" to get original rather than fan art.
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt care if someone used my art, unless they lie and say it‚Äôs theres.
I dare each person that complained to go out and attempt to make their fanart free episode.  I stand by 99.999% of everything you said in this video.  The one thing that I can't stand by is how dare you to say Luigi has a hoo hah!  You have reached a new low!!!  LOL     much love and thank you for all you and your team does.
I want more realtalk MatPat
But this is just a chat, a MatChat
I love you videos matpat. No matter what happens
Thank you, Matt, for speaking for us fan artist and teaching us one or two things about how to publish are art and be reasonable and aware. ‚ù§

I actually believe that Scott released a new game just to mess with Matpat


He's watching
MatPat: FNaF SOLVED!!!
Scott: Hold my Exotic butters
Scott: (makes FNaF 7)
MatPat: 0:06
MatPat: finishes fnaf series

Scott: hOLd mY eXoTic BuTtErs-
Matpat: not a game in 3 mounths I‚Äôm saved

Matpat: yeets fnaf

Matpat: finally I have finish fnaf
Scott: surprise motherf###er
Matpat: well at least batim is over
The meatly: not so fast
Matpat: finally finished with fnaf

Scott: yes, but actually no
I'm convinced Scott and Miyamoto are in cahoots to keep you talking about FNAF and Mario's height just to screw with you.
Fnaf 7:
Me:*heavy breathing*
Damn it Scott. Matpat was FINALLY getting SOME sleep.
I remember back then when fnaf 3 came out I was scared of the game so I thought the 4 game would be the end 
I WAS WRONG
No..
NO GOD NO!
NO
NO-Insert game theory intro
I don't know if this is even helpful... But it might help? I don't know how, but anyway...
COUGH COUGH
In FNAF 2, you can see the endoskeleton in Mangle's mouth, but in UCN, you can't. This probably doesn't even matter, but it could...
BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY - A GAME THEORY!
Thanks for reading.
"you can tellf rom the general shape of the nose"
Don't they look completely different?
Matpat: FNAF is finished!


Scott: UNO REVERSE CARD



Edit: 1.2K likes in 2 hours

Scott: YOU HAVE ACTIVATED MY TRAPCARD. Releases images
Mat: okay I'm done with fna-







Scott: 






Mat:

"No God please no!!   NO!!! NO!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"


Edit: AHA!!  the jumpscare on  didn't get me
Me and my friends say hell by saying he- double hockey sticks
You tubers: these jump scares are scary 

Theorists: Their is an unspoken horror
Just as how the vengeful spirit will never let William leave, Scott will never let MatPat be done
MAT when you speed up old man consequences William says MIIIIKEEE HEELP MEE MIKEEE HELP MEEE check it out!!!
MatPat: This was my last theory!

What if... the help wanted game is actually gonna involve (drumroll please, OL WILLY!
I just noticed that the last image is named ‚Äú0rgn‚Äù, which can be heard as ‚ÄúOrgan‚Äù, you know,  like innards 
So it that image is very likely Enard
0:36 Don't let the springlocks get to you, MatPat.
Scott is going to milk this game series for all it‚Äôs worth
Matpat: so this is the last episode of fnaf

Scott: well yes but acually no
Just one question, why is funtime foxy in the image, when foxy is already there! This could be something about mangle. Possibly not but just a guess
When you think a game is fineshed 

Scott: here is a new game
Plot twist, Matt is Scott just trying to keep his career going
18:48 lol I know dis meme and also 

Matt Patt: OH MY GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH a new fnaf?
Matpat: Finally finished FNaF!

Scott: Hold my pizza
How I spent my day today: Binge watching all of the FNAF theories on this channel...cuz why not?
MatPat:Finally Im Done

Scott:Let Me End This Man Career
Yea, It's back and improved! It's fnaf theory time!!!
Scott: Only 2 games then its done.
MatPat: exists
Scott: how about instead it‚Äôs 7 games but there all a troll with the release dates
Matpat:I'm done with fnaf

Nightmare'scott:900k games and make  matpat suffferüòà

Scott : hold my exotic butters
Scott: time to bring you back to He double toothpick
Heyya pal uhhhhhhhh Scott expanded the universe....there is a dog character and a new book soooooo yeahhhhh good luck with your new theory heheh
Matpat wilding makes a whole vid about one picture
Lets be honest, Mat is making the story of fnaf.....not Scott, the guy is probably just taking the credit
Nice video, but I preferred the old FNAF theories where he stayed off screen.
'Here lies mat pat' (Matpat walks out of his coffin)'Matpat were are you going'fanf '315152626 is out'
MatPat: HW. JPEG.
Me: sorry, idk what a jpeg is, I just want a picture of a god darn hotdog.
MatPat: FNaF is over 

Scott: Hold my dead children.
Freddy as hand print on this face
I feel like Matt should stop saying: "This is the end of FNaF"
cause I feel like he's cursed when he says that. Everytime Matt says it Scott is just sitting there like: " How bout nah I'mma keep my casual bongos going and having coffee with toast graced by my ExOtIc BuTtErS "
Therapist: FNAF: Help Wanted isn‚Äôt real, it can‚Äôt hurt you


FNAF: Help Wanted:
Mat: How many Games are you gonna make, Scott?

Scott Cawthon: Y E S
MatPat: finally. done. no more fnaf theories.



Scott:

This man has spent 10x more time studying Fnaf than I have in my entire school life on things like academics
I feel like ‚Äúremember jeremy‚Äù would be like jogging jeremy‚Äôs memory
Mat pat: I‚Äôm done with fnaf 
Scott: hold my beer
Is it just me or does anyone get ecstatic when his theme tune comes on
Also, 0rgn... Origin.

MatPat: Thinks He Done The Final Theory



Scott: yOuR nOt FiNiShEd YeT

matpat:

"This is my final FNAF theory!"
"Mattpatt, you've shown us your final FNAF theory for the 7th week in a row"
The anamatronics look like they're in an insane asylum
more books!? i should have read the first three sooner.
10 years later

MatPat: WE FINISHED FNAF!!!!!

Scott: 

MatPat: my life is a lie
MatPat: finally done-
Scott: No no we‚Äôre just getting started
What if Help Wanted is a subversive title like Sister Location? Similarly to how "Sister Location" was actually the location of your sister, maybe "Help Wanted" refers to someone asking for help, rather than a job opening.
I read another comment about reading the text backwards, read their theory on it, and came up with a similar, little more complex one. Here it is:


"Remember Jeremy?" 
The boss is talking to the technicians about him.

"It was an accident"
"We let something inside"
"Don't listen to them"
This is the two technicians telling the boss that they accidentally let something inside, something that possibly killed Jeremy. The "don't listen to them" implies that maybe there are rumors spread about the technicians causing the death of Jeremy, and are telling their boss:
"Don't listen to them, it wasn't our fault"
Matt Patt makes a theroy

Scott: I'm about to debunk this man's whole theory ‚òïüßê
MatPat: Finally, this is my final FNAF theory.

Scott: Well yes, but actually no.
Has the game come out yet? And the fist time I looked at this teaser when I saw the welding I thought it was fire lol!!!ü§£üòÖ
MatPat: sneezes
Scott: dID YOu SAy nEw gAMe?

Quero tradu√ß√£o em portugu√™s, adoro fnaf √© a comunidade de fnaf brasileira fala mto bem das suas teorias
Fans: How long will FNaF be?

Scott:
Mat: I have solved fnaf

Scott: hold my exotic butters
MatPat: fnaf is over

Scott: hold my exotic butters
I really love The Puppet
shes my favorite character
(she? he?)
Matt: Im finally done with fnaf theories




Scott: 
Afton says he always come back so he is maybe in fanf 7
(1) Are you dooin meams to get hit with the kidsü§£
(2) OMG YASSS FANF THEORYS WILL BE BACKüòÄüòÅ
(3) wow another fnaf game that i have to get to see how my own theroys are diffrent or similar to yours üòë
MatPat thinks fnaf is done

Scott: lets fix that with a controlled shock

Thanks for the likes everyone!
Remember when your done with fnaf 8 
There Will always be this word in your mind
"I ALWAYS COME BACK"
FNAF battle royale

Scott: Y E S
10 seconds in and already a Office reference :')
Btw in bad ending fnaf 3, it shows the 4 animatronics, or 5? There is one in the background. Probably springtrap
Matpat: Supposedly solved FNAF.

Scott: wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
Scott Cawthon: *updates*
Pat: Aw s**t, here we go again.
wat channel is the fanf film going on when it comes out and you need to theorize
Is fnaf over ?

Scott: YESN'T
What's with the gay version of the rogue hair from xmen? ü§î ü§î
MatPat:I've solved the entire FNAF series

Scott:I'am about to end this man's whole career
MATT PATT  IS BACK AT IT AGAIN FOLKS!!! cries with happiness
Aaaaaannnd matpat told the lore of a game that isnt even out yet. üëèüëèüëè
The game may not be about someone in prison, however I still think that someone was wrongfully found guilty, because Afton DOES return to the old pizzeria to destroy the animatronics. He couldn't do that in prison.
Matpat: This is the last FNAF vid I'm doing
Scott: Hold my exotic butters
Matpat is on screen. 
That only means...


HE LEFT THE RECORDING CLOSET!!
MatPat: my final definitive FNAF video
Scott: honey!? Get my exotic butter ready, MatPat thinks he's done
0:30 i just realized golden freddy on te tv

Scott:mabeyyyyyyy
One year later
Matpat:its done i think

Matpat: "I'm done with the fnaf videos!"

  

Scott: 
MatPat:Finally,No MOre fnaf...!

Scott: * checks time * * whistles* Sorry,What?!
Just a Fact:

If this is true...then the person(s) who were talking...to one another in the 4th Night at Sister Location...were Those Guys(Co-Workers)
Scot:*release new game*

Mattpat:GAmE THeORy
Hi MatPat, Have you ever wondered if these techniques were shadow freddy and shadow bonnie?
Scott: makes more fnaf

Matt: exist

MatPat: FINALLY ITS DONE HALLELUJAH PRAISE JESUS
Scott: hold meh beer..
Hold on i just had a thought in my mind, if we are william afton in custom night why is springtrap an option?
I feel like I should inform that your vids make great background noise for when I'm drawing üòÖ
Scott: releasing a new FNaF teaser


MatPat: *chuckles*  I'm in danger
All the Xbox players are quaking that they can‚Äôt compare ü§™
1950‚Äôs: I bet we MatPat will solve Fnaf in 2019

2019: Flying cars
2 things I have to say: 1. Henry created lefty to capture the puppet, 2. Will anyone find out WHY William did it, or is it not possible?!
MatPat: Covers up Fnaf theory

Scott: Now this looks like a job for me
Matpat: fnaf is over and I know it


Scott: HOLd MY GODDAMN EXOTIC  BUTTERS
Why now is't subtiled in portuguese 

Whyüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Friend: well, we found-
Me: this is taking to long I quit.
thanks for that freddy jumpscare that made me jump lmao XD
Scott : releases new teaser


Matpat : I already killed this guy like 5 times.
(FNAF be comes out)
Matpat:crys in closet
Steph:why
"Filthy Frank. Miss you."

Darn it
It's amazing.........






How much a hack fraud like Mat Pat can talk about FNAF, but even more so how many people consume this crap, i mean, kids get fixiated with crap like this, is ok, we are dumb as children, we are gulible and eat whatever industry has to offer, we are terrible consumers when we have 10, but come one, if you have above 16 and you still follow this videos, you better be "special" or something....
All I could thunk during this episode is "Why would the spirits be haunting the guard in prison if he was innocent?"
Scott : Makes new fnaf game

Matpat: phew glad that's over
Scott: it's rewind time

I wish everyone would look in the back background of the teaser image. There are other animatronics hidden in the images
The FNAF series AKA: The Eternal Torment Of Matthew Patrick
"Will I be right in my predictions?"
Umm no... Scott probably watched this and rushed to change his game...

scott: hmmm how bout 100 more fnaf games? 

matpat: 
Mat today:NO GOD PLEASE NO

Mat in 3019:..... I‚Äôm dead
What if Scott is in cahoots with mat and he's just constantly releasing bullshit so mat can make videos and get money and Scott's getting a certain percentage of it.ü§î
This wouldn‚Äôt happen if Scott Cawthon didn‚Äôt watch your ‚ÄúFortnite stealing again‚Äù  video intro
MatPat: Solves fnaf mystery
ScottCawthon: released fnaf 7
MatPat: Am I a jOkE tO yOu?
Matpat:NOOO GOD NOOO NOOO GOD NOOO

Me if I was in the room:IM OUT NOT GONNA HEAR ANOTHER THEORY
Technicians: exist
Edner:I'm about to end these men careers
Scott starts makings a new game
Matpat: Oh poop, here we go again
What if Jeremy was "the one you should have not killed"?
Edit: they always refer to the one you should have not killed as him or he
We all knew FNAF will never die. It always comes back. 
I aLwAyS cOmE bAcK
idk if this is a thing but it seems that springtrap is replaced by nightmarionne now in the vr game's image
I just double tapped to like the video üòÇ I‚Äôve been on Instagram for too long
ARE WE REALLY NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE NEW FORMAT????????? BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T GET USE TO THIS
BRUH U GOTTA SON 1ST KINDLY KIEN 2CND RAZZBOWSKI 3RD YOU
Matpat : Finally. Finally I am done with Fnaf
Scott : Well yes, but actually no
0:12

Matt pat has my reaction when someone told me I was still alive
It had to b June 26th 
my birthday is June 27th
Happy birthday eve woohoo
me: looks at foxy and funtime foxy plushies
sighs forget it
throws self into fandom of fnaf
Wait.. what happened to the recording closet? 
I‚Äôve been gone for so long, this is sad. I like this style of video so I‚Äôm cool with itüíï but when did it change?
Scott: I'm done with fnaf
Also Scott: Yes, but actually no
Pls talk about how in assassins creed odessey you can survive a fall from any hight
Beginning=Matpat whenever a new game comes out.
DID YOU KNOW? games are also called video games.
MatPat: This is the secret of FNaF 7! 


Scott: Yes, but not really...
Matpat:it's over fin-
Scott:*kicks down door* who tf gave you permission to say that

Edit:hmmmm 995 likes the most likes I will ever getüò©(thanks so much guys)
"So how-"
Scott- Yes
loved that office reference at the beginning
Bhai can you promote me
Matpat: * slaps Scott on the back * this bad boy can fit so much pain and stress in it 


Also Matpat: okay I'll take it!
Mat: FNAF is finally done!
Scott: Releases a new FNAF game

Matt: Am I a joke to you?
Mat pat:i'm finished with fnaf
Scott:hold my beer
MatPat. You are the only thing keeping FNAF barely alive. Don‚Äôt make any videos about FNAF and you will never have another FNAF game again. Problem solved.
I thought the gravestones represent the animatronics. Therefore the ‚ÄúJeremy‚Äù the teaser is referring to is one of the spirits behind angry or out for revenge or something. But I like this theory tooü§î
Scott when he releases a game: 



You won‚Äôt get tired of my voice will you?
Fnaf has joined the chat
Mat has joined the chat.
Sanity has left the chat
The handprint on freddy‚Äôs face is back??
person: so how many more fnaf games?


Scott: yes
Mat, you know that even if this theory is right Scott's gonna make another game to make it be incorrect
scott probably has all this sh33t planed out and is planing a fnaf 10 with hidden messages in the walls of fnaf 4.
(comes back in 2030) OH MY GOD-
Matpat: Finally done let me rest in pepperonis

Scott: hold my pizza
Matpat: Man that series was a rough ride



Scott:*chuckles* omae wa mou shindeiru



Matpat: NANI!
Mat: OH GOD NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!
Me: OH YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!
If there kids pjs how do they fit him
Mattpatt is a kid
But hey that's just a theory!
A game theory theory
I feel like Scott is making FNAF games simply to piss off MattyPatty here. ü§£ü§£
That's the best impression I've ever seen of the "No God, please no" meme.
The Jumpscare actually scared meü§£
hello game theory i have not watched your vids sorry k 


Oh yeah i subbed
Imperfectly balanced as no things should be.
does anyone watch these without having played a single fnaf title?
mathew: i completed fnaf
scott: no a triple aaa game and a movie and a vr game
@Brebel Appliance nah
MatPat:Im done with F.N.A.F
Scott:IM BOUT TO JUMPSTART THIS MAN‚ÄôS WHOLE CAREER
Mat pat: my last fnaf theory 

Scott : let‚Äôs make a new game
But the technicians were hanged??
Edit; uhm nvm
Matpat:is fnaf over?
Scott:well yes but actually no
When will they just explain the whole thing dude
May be you can do a game theory on brutal legends??üëã
I love it when he says Jeremy




Cuz dats my name
The hand print is still on Freddy but more visible
Matpat: This is the final theory


Scott: I always come back
The title changed
Remember when there was pretty much only Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy?... Heh
Scott: Wasn‚Äôt good enough.
People: WE NEED A BETTER VR GAME ALL OF THIS SUCKS
Scott: Hold my beer
One day we will be in the ‚Äòend game‚Äô but not today
MatPat: so the series is actually done and I can get some sleep right?
Scott: Well yes, but actually no
I got a qusetion: Did William Afton went to prison?
MatPat: Finally I'm done!

Scott: pfffff- HAHAHAHA lol no * releases new game *

MatPat: * looks at camera * Am I a joke to you Scott?



* NOT MY IDEA *
Matpat: well I‚Äôm done with my FNAF theories!

casual bongos slowly intensifies

Theory: Matpat has lost his mind killed scott, and taken over fnaf
Matpat... this is the 7th week in a row you‚Äôve shown your final fnaf theory in class


( I definitely didn‚Äôt take that from a meme )
I guessed that the bonnie image was from the first game before he said it and I feel so proud üò¢
0:07 YES GOD YES YES YES
MatPat: So that is the WHOLE story of FNAF.
Scott: Well yes, but actually no.
Yay it‚Äôs back thx Scott
Matpat: finally get everything done with FNAF.
Scott: I about to end this whole man career.. AKA. Releases a new game that changes the timeline and make mat theory false.
I love the Office reference in the beginning üòÇüòÇüòÇ Comedy GOLD üëçüëçüëç
Matpat:my theory is complete 

Scott: i‚Äôma bout to ruin this guy career
Scott talking about fnaf being over:
yes but actually no
Scott cawthon: breathes
Matpat: hold my diet coke
Finally,  now I‚Äôve seen an actual model of Spring Bonnie made by Scott, kinda
Matt really likes dressing as Freddy... 
This isn‚Äôt even the first time he‚Äôs been spotted wearing a bear costume... üêª
MatPat: so now that we are done with FNAF we can finally move on to-

Scott: 
Make a video about why sonics eyes are atached.
Matpat you think you can do a game theory based on a game called "Burning Daylight", the game play is about 30 mins and has alot of things i think you can talk about
Hey Mat Pat! I'm a viewer and I got theory for you! If Jessie and James from team Rocket are well apart of them well then, explain their white uniforms, because every one and I mean every one wear a black uniform including Giovanie and Archer but why do Jessie and James have white ones? Now that's a theory!
Matpat: I solved it all... FINALLY FNAF IS SOLVED
Scott: hold my exotic butters, I‚Äôm about to end this mans whole career.
No one:

JK rowling: matpat and fnaf had an intense sexual relationship
Scott cothen has gathered all the infinity stones but hasn't snapped yet

Scott is NOT done! He will never be done with FNAF!
Scott is trying to convert Mat to the Scott side by making him re-create Michael Scott's famous Toby meme.
Therapist: FNAF 7 doesn‚Äôt exist, it can‚Äôt hurt you
FNAF 7:

MatPat: Finally, FNAF is finished! No more!

Matpat: I can now die a happy theorist
Scott: Oh, are you sure?

Top 10 anime returns




EDIT 2: Thank you for the likes, you really made my day :D
Someday, MatPat will realize there is no Scott. It was just MatPat.

Just MatPat. Just MatPat. Just MatPat.
I liked the OG GT Opening. The 8-bit Science Blaster... the one by Spelling Phailer...
He started filming these kinds of videos because of article 13 I think.
11:48 sobs FRANKU!!!!
Matpat: finally I'm done with fnaf
Fnaf: I ALWAYS COME BACK
Were back with FANAF
When jumpscaring you Toy bonnie looks like they are having fun diving.
Was the intro an Office reference? I don't watch the show
What if




Scott was the killer and now he is telling a story
So when do you want to complete this game series? 

Scott: yes
Matpat:NO GOD NO NO NO

Fnaf fandom:YES GOD YES YES YES

Hey Matt, remember Candy Cadet?, remember when he said there were 5 "things"-(5 keys, 5 kittens, 5 kids) sowed together into one?....maybe the "melted creature thing" (which has 5 animatronics in one) is was what Candy Cadet was talking about! üò±ü§îüòèüòÅ

Edit: I also just realized that the keys, kittens, and kids all start with K... Hmmm...ü§îü§î
I'm here, not because I like FNAF, but because I want to see Matpat's slow descent to madness...
Ohh hell nooooooooh
i showed your video to my class I got an A++
finally 
a new fnaf game
im ready to get spooky 
fred boi
What if the security guards who talk about Jeremy we're friends with him and the reason why Jeremy died and the bite was because he was trying to fix, mangle and got bit in the process, and this is why Scott made this game baby, it's just a theory one that I came up with, what do you think yay or nay
matpat: exists

scott: i'm about to end this man's whole career
If William Afton is spring-trap how is spring-trap a character in ultimate custom night and it says scraptrap is William Afton
Maybe we will find out what happened to chica s beak ??? Maybe the technician s messed something
Did you like, turn into TheOdd1sOut?
They shoulda hired you to find Tupac you damn detectiveüôåüèΩ
Mat : Fnaf the FINAL timeline 
Scott : Fnaf 7 
Mat : Am i a joke to you?
Is it possible that Jeremy is Michael's older brother?
Pls bring back moving around the picture of Matpat. The last 6 videos haven't been the same.
Again, my boy deadass has a grey hair streak
I've got a theory it's  about mangle. Now everybody has fought about mangles gender ( not anymore tho '-_-) but my theory is that mangle is both genders because of it's two heads ( originally I thought mangle was a girl because well she was a girl when she came to this hell called JR'S so who made the rumour that she was a boy >:( ,)but that's just a theory by me. People : BOO impostor, phoney, fake.
Literally every FNAF theory:
Fnaf 1: this is the story...I think
Fnaf 2: okay, this is the story
Fnaf 3: ...now this is the story
Fnaf 4: now THIS is the story
Fnaf Sister Location: *internal suffering
Fnaf 6: you've gotta be kidding me! Oh well, at least it's the en-

Matpat:  ...this is fine
Scott: there's even more after this
Matpat:  SCREEEEEEEE
8:53 Keyword there being ‚Äúfalse‚Äù ending.
Yep I'm sure 25% of people are gonna play that VR game like if u agree
Anyone else catch the The Office reference at the beginning?
also idk but at 9:42 where yourright hand is look under it HMMMMMMMMM an D
MatPat was kidnapped and is stuck in Scott‚Äôs basement. He‚Äôs being forced to make theories on Fnaf.
bro is you bring all of the first hidden words it says dont we it remember mix them up and it says we dont remember it
I died cause one of the jumpscaresüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Scott Cawthon: yeah there are 2 new characters who knew Jeremy and are trying to survive the same fate


also Scott Cawthon: oh and they're already dead in a previous game
Ah shiz, here we go again
Scott:* announces new FNAF game *

MatPat:* confused screaming *
So the children pyjamas ARE the animatronics. Children inside. üëè perfect design
Huh neat, I was actually curious where the fnaf franchise went
I have a feeling that Scott is watching us
Mat pat : pls no more fnaf game scott
Scott : na im going to mack one more 
Me: nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Matt pat: I‚Äôm done yes finally!!!!!

Scott: UNO REVERSE CARD!
WELP LETS GO GET ON THE MARKIMOO BUS
yes yes yes oh yes yes esssssssssssssssssss
MatPat: 

Scott: 

MatPat: ...

Scott: 
Wait, I may be wrong, but I thought that the bite of 87 victim survived despite losing his frontal lobe. I thought that was what phone guy said.
In the Future...
MatPat: Finally no Fnaf games.
Scott: opens a Pizzeria with animatronics
I have my own theory

Wot if the time he dat boi died in spring trap, it actually wasn't that other thing that you said, and was this instead


When the water drops call on the floor, there is no puddle, so wut if the drops were ghosts, and each time they dropped, that were strangling him?

Idk that's my theory
Nah you got that wrong probably if ¬´remember jeremy¬ª was meant the way you thought it should of had a question mark...
MatPat: what happens when you lose two technicians two animatronic fatality? 

Me: the pizzeria gets shut down and a new one has to open?
0:03 Show of hands, who saw that coming?
Everyone - ‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã
Matpat: FNAF is finally over
Scott:Well yes... But actually No
You can really see how much has changed in the editing since the other editor took his own lifeüò¢
No...




I thought it was over.
Dear Scott coffin 





You will never beat minecraft
It has been a very long time since II havent watched this channel and I wasnt suspecting you to make more in life apparitions to illustrate the video.
I wasnt suspecting this but hey its videos from you thats always something im happy about ^^
looks back at Freddy plushie


sigh
PETSCOP 17 AND 18
Battle royale....?
Five nights at fortnite
Haw many combinations of mind craft are there
What if the blurred image is enard in real life? That means it could be that scott is making a movie who else belive it? :v üôãüèº it looks more realistic for me
MatPat: FNAF is solved.

Scott: Hold my non-alcoholic beverage.
Im surprised noones talking about Matts new approach on doing these videos. ACTUALLY APPEARING IN THE VIDEO instead of a VO
The thumbnail subtitles are my reaction to seeing another fnaf theory video.
It looks a bit more like molten freddy but ennard goes on to become him in the pizzeria simulatorar correct?
1:19 For me this is very accurate
Freddy is eating children and you are often eating our childhood
Matpat: Finally, no more fnaf.

Scott Smiling Through Blinds at matpat
good job getting honey to sponsor you next stop coke
My idea for fanf is we're you play as purple guy before he goes mad his days into madness
IM SOOOOO HYPE FOR THE VR GAME
Scott knew this man is going to analyse everything
*Scott releases another fnaf game eventho matpat has already tried to end the timeline 2 times*

Matpat: Am I a jOke to you?
the jumpscare is at 10:56 if anyone needs it
matpat:.... switches channel 
Matpat:0_0 noooo.....noooo...nooo...no god nooooo....nooooo..NOOOOO...NOO-
Sry but I wished  upon a star and wished for the story not to end
Still have questions not answered sry pat
Hello comments section, welcome to Game Theory! I wish I had friends :)
Matpat*Exists*
Scott:hIppITY HOppITY, yOuR Sanity Is NoW mY PrOpeRTy
What if it was remember
-jeremy  as if the message was from him
My phone flew off my hand from the jumpscare
looks at line up of pop figures and pc goodbye cruel world
*steals matt pats pj's*I'll take that its mine now!üòÄ
Yo I swear at this point Scott is just making these for MatPatüòÇ
U should play this who agrees
I honestly think that this is less lore building more just for the heck of it.
Me last year: WHOOF. Finally, the madness can end. Im happy for me and Matpat. No more FNAF vids, mysteries or games. (LONG HAPPY SIGH)

Scott: Did somebody say new game?

EVERYONE:NOOOOOOOOOO
For me remember Jeremy is like him talking to Jeremy and saying remember about that
Scott: makes a new game

Matpat:
let me in LET ME INNN
No one:
Matpat at 11:21 = üëèifüëèitüëèisüëè
DUDE
üëèüèª
Candy Cadet‚Äôs stories
I actually really like Matpat's hair like this
Told you hahahaha hahah hahahahahahahahahahahahaahahhaahahahahahahahahahahaahhaahahahahahahah it will never end üôÇ
Matpat : Makes new fnaf theory
Scott : Well Actually...
Matpat : Am I a joke to you?
Oh oh i think scot cathon is getting exposed
Time for matpat to go through pain and suffering again
Office reference at the start on point
13:25 HECK
No one:
Scott Cawthon: mORE LORE
Matpat: distant sounds of mind breaking
Mat Pat speaking to Scott: "I HAVE SOLVED YOUR FRANCHISE, YOU HAVE BEEN-"
Scott: "Hold that thought. I just released by new game teaser online. What were you saying?"
Mat Pat: crying in the corner cause he doesn't want to make another fnaf theory
Wasn't Mike the kid that got bit by Fred ear in 1983? And not Jeremy, wasn't that bunny's name?
like who missed fnaf theorys
I thought Jeremy was the kid inside bonnie
Back into the rabbit hole we go...
Oh god no. Its so old and who would care about it. PLEASE NO SCOTT!
These freaky games need to go away forever and never be remembered
Matpat in this vid reminds me of the guy that gets stuff in fnaf 1
i actually rlly like game and film theory and u cant stop me
Nobody:
Scott: so what I'm hearing is FNAF 7?
On the Scottgames website at the bottom right of the VR help wanted teaser Bonnie‚Äôs eyes are dark. Not light like the others and same with the puppet. 

Baby‚Äôs eyes are reflective. What is being shown through her eyes?

What if the white dots in the background make a picture? 
I keep noticing eyes in them.
Damnit never mind you'll be doing fnaf videos
wow that's pretty epic
Your wrong about no more FNAF games XD
MatPat- Are we finally done?!
Scott- Well yes, but actually no...
Hey, did you guys notice that the first letters in Help and Wanted might also actually stand for Henry = H = Help William =W=Wanted
but wait what if your not in every place but one place
maybe because theres all them then they not anywere but everywear in one building
Chaos Theory is a thing, right?
If we play as purple guy why does springtrap and jimmy neutron springtrap attack you and how?
Scott: makes new trailer
Matpat: am I a joke to you
Well guess I'm going to GameStop.
The beginning tho
"NO. NO GOD NO"
William Afton is one of the technotion sorry I can‚Äôt spell.
I still want a game where you go around and get your vengeance on these things for scaring people.  Walk around in VR and be able to fight these things instead of just trying to survive them.
Literally everyone: So it's done, right?
Scott: Well yes, but actually no.
Rip Pyrocincal petscop2
why was fursuit on the list u furry
sigh... if there was a way to put scott into NASA we wouldve most likely already be living on mars playing his next game.
Jeremy Heere?
MatPat: its finally over

Scott: I was only using 2% of my power

MatPat: NANI¬ø!
IM EXCITED
Ôº≠ÔΩèÔΩíÔΩÖ„ÄÄÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖÔΩèÔΩíÔΩâÔΩÖÔΩìÔºå„ÄÄÔºπÔº•Ôº°Ôº®ÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
Henry is phone guy ‚òéÔ∏è
I feel like your William aftin  and fnaf is golden freddy.
You know it's a big deal when it's MatPat talking in person instead of infinitely photoshopping one still image.
Remember fnaf world fnaf 59?I think he can go further than that
Hey! You really should do a theory for Identity V! I feel like it‚Äôs gonna be another of te really annoying ones but Tencent did a good job adding in the mystery and horror into the game
Matpat you should be a detective
I can't wait for Scott to message Mat Pat and ask him to stop making these videos because they're spoiling EVERYTHING. THIS MAN IS INSANE. ITS TIME TO STOP LOL i love it though
I swear to scott, one day, this game will break matpat
Exotic butter me suprised, fnaf strikes them bongos again
But the big question is will someone /you play it :(???
I assume that the bars in the image is to show that its in VR, like a digital room like the training room in street fighter ect
The fun time foxy looks more like lolbit I see purple
Matpat: finally done with FNAF!


Scott: its free real estate
the lobe lad himself
OH GOD PLEASE NO IM IN A EXAM PLEASE JUST 1 MORE WEEK
When you think something is done 




Think agian üòê
Cmon I've been gone for 4 months on youtube and i see you doing fnaf
It‚Äôs weird to see him actually talk rather than the big-eyed image
but what if someone allrety has honey?
Who else is loving the office reference at the beginning XD
The more theory's we hear in FANAF, the more I feel MattPat is onto the right road.....just missing some things because of the analytical mind.
Where did this channel go wrong
i came here to see Matpat Having a Mental Breakdown
Yey,New game, new Matt fnaf theories
make a theory about the story of Hollow Knight
That's not fun time foxy dude
Hey Matt, uhh, why does the poster in the office back  in fnaf 1 beep when you click it? Is it just an Easter egg or has meaning?,
Matpat: Finally!!!! Fnaf is finally over!!

Scott: Hold my pizza üçï
Well Mat you wearing children's pajamas is kinda creepy but you do you...
Jermy has his own story branch
did anyone else also notice that the time line is backwards?
Next game FNAF BATTLE ROYAL
Anybody have the feeling that Scott changes the plot line when pat gets it right?
that intro though damn mat
It's truly never... OGRE
1:17 Yeah, agreed. That's pretty weird
Do another puzzle with your merch
Matpat: Yes I‚Äôm finally done
Scott: hold my exotic butters 
Scott: Drops new steam post about 3 games and new books
Matpat: we had a deal Scott
Ennard: 
Let me in 
LET ME IIIIIINNNNNN
These are all of the fnaf theory‚Äôs mat pat made
‚Üì
In assassins creed oddesy you can survive from any hight you should talk about it
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh yeah ü§©
Scott: Fnaf 7 is out now!! 

Mat: rocking back and forth in the corner
this man has white hair????
What if there‚Äôs something in the name since you have to ha back
9:04 Peppa pig?
Perhaps this may be us fixing the animatronic and perhaps later there could be one final game with all the animatronics in one new big location
You do know Scott is gonna flip your theory on its head.




Multiple times
Do you mean upper left hand corner?
1% comments are talking about the actual video
YES YES YES YES OH YES HEHEHEHEBEHEBEBEHEHEHEHEHHEHEHEHE
Nooo! No god please! NO! NOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOO-
He protec

He attac

But most importantly 


He angry when Freddy is bacc
Hihihihihi,
vvvvv random but I've had this thought since midday at school when I couldn't post, but the "Remember Jeremy" line, what if that some sort of mention towards the child's gravestone? I don't remember if you mentioned it, but I remember you speaking of the gravestones and one of the children named was Jeremy. It's kind of a long shot theory if it's connected that way but I was just thinking about it.
im not as smart as him but i understood every word he said
If only 0:00 - 0:14 had a green screen effect on the T.V.
IT'S THE BROTHER AGAIN! FREEING THE SOULS! REMEMBER? HE WAS GOING AROUND, UNDOING ALL THE DAMAGE HIS FATHER HAD DONE. ALSO HE GOES BACK TO HIS OLD HOUSE AND INTO HIS BROTHER'S OLD ROOM. THAT'S ALSO WHY WE SEE BABY. BABY HAS THE SOUL OF THE SISTER!!! OMFG YESSSS SCOTT! Edit: sorry this is in caps, I was exited üòÇ
Scott just gives Matt the finger everytime Matt thinks it‚Äôs over
Scott: Hold my bear.
For me this was the most hype I've ever been
See the new format fits this type of video really well
I have a question about the timeline:
Right in your version of the timeline, you said that fnaf 2 came first in the timeline but then the problem will be that the withered animatronics of Freddy, Bonny, Chica and foxy wouldn‚Äôt have the spirits yet of the og. And how would the new animatronics (The fnaf 2 ones) also get the spirits of the 5 other children?
MatPat: WE FINISHED IT
Scott: HOld mY diEt cOkE
Since I‚Äôve recently gotten the psvr I kinda wanna buy the game but also don‚Äôt wanna get traumatized, y‚Äôknow?
Still waiting on the explanation on how the puppet works...
Damn mat,you rocking that white streak
that office meme in the beginning though
MatPat - You know, I‚Äôm finally able to get some sleep.

Scott - Sleep? Never heard of her.

MatPat - What do you‚Äî  oh no...

Scott - Oh yes
I want you to answer this question Matt Pat how did all the bosses in Cuphead get contracts and why do we have to collect them?
The thing they "let in" was Eric Andre, he finally got his way.
Wait What The Hell You Back?
whats a AAA game, and whats an AR game? sorry for not being educated XD
When I saw fnaf in the title the first thing I thought was:
Oh. Oh no. Not again.
I feel ya MatPat.
Scott is making ur life miserable xD
Jumpscares in VR? oh no
I thought you were done
11:50 The memes are getting too strong.
YouTube has some parts of the game
What if the teaser Mat Pat said was ennard was actually a picture of an animatronic taken (in the words of officer clay.) from maximum range. It's probably blurry because of the chip
üò≠üò¢üò≠üò¢üò≠üò¢üò¢üò•üò•
Matpat, the springtrap from the teaser image has a far different nose than the actual one in the games. The one from the games is deformed and has a more square like appearance. The one in the teaser has a smooth look with a more triangular shape, it looks like fan art.
Matpat:I am don-


Scott:SINCE WHEN WERE U THE ONE IN CHARGE
Hey Mat. Iwas playing some custom night challenges and I clicked on the old friends challenge and  of course Freddy Bonnie chica the toys spring trap puppet phone guy and 

Circus baby with makes me think that baby was an old friend don‚Äôt know if this will help but I thought I would let you know
Lmao Scott is really determined to frustrate matpat 15:35
Freddy still has that handprint on him
And Scott disappeared from the comments again.
matpat: I FINALLY FINISHED THE THEORY

SCOTT: BUT WAIT, THERES MORE
4:01 rip Matpat
So first we get to be in the place of Jeremy since he died. now we get to play as 2 u techincian workers who also died. so in every game when workers died, the game has √•  part when it says help wanted so you can take place of that worker,.......I feel like im just writing a More understandable version of this video. Why?
Now feels like 10 years of this franchise. Hope there will be an Endgame at the last of FCU(Freddy Cinematic Universe).
when I'm older I'm gonna get my kids into fnaf  and then teach them the ways  and tell them who the kings are          


matpat and markiplier
Fnaf game: exists

Matpat: hold my beer
If you copy the poster on Scott‚Äôs sit for the game then paste it for some reason it says remember Jeremy
Scott: I will never let you leave. I will never let you rest.
Dude you cray cray
I just noticed that in the teaser image that was most displayed in the video, on Freddy's face, above the eyebrow (right), there are these odd marks that kinda look like finger imprints to me. just thought id point it out
MatPat: FINALLY! FNAF IS DONE!

Scott: poor, naive MatPat... when will you learn... WhEn WiLl YoU lEaRn....







 
i mean at least its not going down the battle royale path...
Game theory I opened up the inspect element on scottgames.com and it has the name verdana what does that mean
Do a theory on The Evil Within - what happened to joseph
Mat just wants to end the fanf but one day it will reach fnaf100
MatPat: We solved FNAF

Scott Cawthon: WE DON'T DO THAT HERE
Fred-HEADS??
Where is my: "But hey, its just a theory, a game theory!" ?
Poise: working as intended
matpat you didn't find out everything about undertale yet. I found out a great theory about dummies cousin! I think dummies cousin is nabstablook I know it might sound crazy but I will explain. in the game when you fight nabstablook he attacks you using his tears that must have been in result of him losing his body and both the songs are the same only dummies song is a remixed version.I know you are going to ask me who destroyed his body so I got a theory about that to. Chara destroyed his body.
MatPat :Fnaf is over!


Scott: Well yes,but actually no
Mattpat: No
Wallet: yes
Yes
He has the best intro
How did Michael afton get the masks in the bite of 1983
No one: ...
Matpat: I'm doing live action now
Wait, maybe this was what Candy Cadet was talking about. Five things melted together.
Michal Scott irl
7:10 wasnt purple guy the one that killed the kids
There better be a trailer if not I'm a rip my Freddy plush
No one: 
Scott: wait did you guys say you wanted A SEVENTH GAME?
Scott is the king of trolling at this point.
Mat: no god! No! No! God no!
Scott: YES!
Arti: As I used to say "here we go again!" I am out of FNAF mode. i had Enough of Freddy fazbear!!!!!! Got it Scott and Mat!? Good!

Edited: I am still a Fnaf fan.
Edited part 2: ( Spoiler Alert) If you look closely at freddy they is a child's foot. Dawko has the video on it.
The second I get my credit card I swear to God I'm gonna buy out your store
OH MA GWAWDDD FNAF IS BACK! üòÖ
I think the only unhappy one about thus is MatPat tbh
MatPat: I am never touching this again
Scott: WE‚ÄôRE RELEASING 10 DIFFERENT THINGS SO YA BETTER START ANALYZIN BUDDY
Matpat can never catch a break from fanf
I like this new editing style
yassssss. Yasssssss just.....yasssssss scotty you habe not faileds me
Scott hates you. And it‚Äôs hilarious.
Mat pat: I‚Äôm done with the the fnaf series 

Scott: hold my beer

Edit: holy crap thanks for the likes
11:50 that's filthy Franks meme
I think that this is after fnaf 6, because as we all know they all melted away leaving the spirts free, but what if the melted together.
Now I no all about fnaf thank you
i already downloaded honey dangit
Matpat: This is my final fnaf theory 



Scott: 
I've watched this video 6 times or more
i reckon the intro to this video is a complete lie
0:01 he‚Äôs smiling lol
Here we go again... (mostly Matpat)
I know where this is going...

FNAF: battle royale

HES HERE HES THERE HES EVERYWHERE. WHO YA GONNA CALL?
PSYCHIC FRIEND FRED BEAR
its coming out april
THIS SUCKS ME!!!I LOVE THIS SERIES BUT ALWAYS SCARED BY THE GAME(CHILDREN CHEER SOUND)
At this rate, Scott will end up making Mat's mind explode!
editing is garbage
Matpat: I‚Äôm done with fnaf!!
Scott: well yes but actually no
scream unholy screaming noooooooooo scott noooooooooooooooooooooo
I thought the technicians got killed by the animatronics
What matpats thinking:why are we still here... Just to suffer
game theory freddy look like he has finger prints over his eye brow a 5 across thing on  freddy
Everyone: Oh god, it's over! No more theories! 
Scott: hold my beer
MatPat: :0
Chaos Theory? The image on the front looks more like the Chaos Insurgency logo from SCP Containment Breach... Check it out...
I love the new style of these, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôve breathed new life into the series and it‚Äôs got passion into it again. Keep it up matpat. Long live game theory!
green screen of the tv intro please
Im just gonna leave this here

So I have a question and a theory the theory is just something I don't think anyone talked about same goes with the question

my theory is as we all know from the survival logbook Michael Afton doesn't seem to remember his name so the possible reason that his name is different in FNAF 1&2 is that he's remembering his Friends who got stuffed Fitz and Jeremy who are foxy and Bonnie

My question is what is the big brother doing throughout all of  is he a bystander is he responsible for something in the lore? And other than the midnight motorist  minigame. He isn't really seen anywhere else so what is he doing?
Scott: Finally I‚Äôm done with fnaf
Also Scott: bUt WaIt, tHeRe‚ÄôS mOrE
Like your intro
note when you brighten the new image only nightmare puppet has a normal eye.
I inspected the website and in the code it said remember jeramy
Rip mat pat......
Matpat: Finally finished the FNAF series!
Scott: releases FNAF 7 poster
Matpat: Am I a joke to you?
Bro at the first bit I kinda sounded like jerry Seinfeld when he was in the show Seinfeld
Chica says lodged in your forehead so couldn‚Äôt that be the bite of 87?
The office reference lol
Hey, I don't know if this is helpful, but when I was playing fnaf 2 I got that minigame when you play has freddy, and in upward right room of the corridor leading to the room you play in the nights, when I got out I saw golden freddy sitting in the corner of the corridor, when i went up to him he oppened his eyes and vanished!


Hope this may be helpful!
Mattpatt: I did it! I solved fnaf!
Scott: Hold my Fazbear
Poooooooooooooooooop
Poooooooooooooooooop
mat, things like FNAF is keep coming back but me
my bank account will be surprised when I tell them my son buys merch games and books about this fnaf I think I am in trouble after the release üò≠üò≠üò≠
What if in the new FNAF vr help wanted you play as the security guard tampering with animatronics and other's such as FNAF 4 player.
Matpat: I solved the FNAF timeline 

Scott Cawthon: HOLD MY BEER
Scott has trolled us a gain
Please release the ARG u spoke of
Maybe the technicians are going to other levels to find out how the made a bad bissnus decision
Did he just do a Michael Scott impression?
Scott is basically just doing these to bully Mat now

(You hear Scott's Maniacal laugh in the background)

Edit: Thanks for Likes!! This is my most so far :D
Don't get why MatPat doesn't just make a 3rd channel called Chaos Theory that deals with all the theories that don't fall into film or games. It also works for the theories that fall into both. It could be used for almost any theory that doesn't fit just into film or game....
Some time you make your video creepy and scary
4:29 are you okay
Screw you Scott
Matpat: I'm finally done with Fnaf!
Scott: whippity wine, your sanity's is now mine
II DIED AT 11:00
is FNAF 8 don't believe me watch....
fnaf 1 fnaf 2 fnaf 3 fnaf 4 fnaf sis location (5) TJOC (6) fnaf custom night (7)
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Nooooooooooooooo not again
Game Theory: Well that‚Äôs the end of FNAF.

Scott: I always come back.
Mat pat, for the theory of Micheal afton is a robot... I don't really think Micheal survive, I think u might have forgot the older brother, maybe it's just Micheal afton, Mike, maybe....
In the picture freddy has a hand shaped smudge on his head I think it's what happens in the game were you fix freddy
Game theorist hey im done with this lore hell SCOTT hold my beer
Is it just me or does this giver you nostalgic
Scott: ‚Äúwatches game theorists final theory‚Äù

Scott: HoLD My FreDBeAr PlUsHIe
When people keep giving you money for a game franchise that died long ago, you know there can't be a "final chapter".
I thought Jeremy was a kid... one of the deceased kids.
Put it on shopee pls..
@The Game Theorists

If the Novels and the games share a single universe then it would make sense that both the puppet and circus baby remain intelligent; both have been identified and neither has closure.

On another line of thought of Elizabeth is circus Baby (Afton‚Äôs daughter) and the Puppet is Charlie (Henry‚Äôs daughter) then the series continuity is in tact. Both would be pissed at Afton. And this game may very well be just filling in where the novels and the games left off: Charlie (novel- IE Henry‚Äôs own ghost) was in fact the one that trapped all the animatronics in the last game and torched them in order to tidy up the mess. However, if the novel process for animatronic possession is true for the games as well it means the fire just made an amalgam out of the souls and possessed animatronics and some poor sap has to clean it all up. (My bets are on John from the novels seeing as he just can‚Äôt leave things alone.)
MatPat: fnaf is done for good
Fnaf: well yes, but actually no
Matpat:fnaf finished.       Scott:more okkkkkkkkkkk$
That intro tho
OMG***
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
FNAF 7
Good luck!
Having Matpat on the screen of a FNAF video feels... weird
Anyone remember two Spanish electricians trying to stop the evil king trouser? Thought so.
It's a cross-over!!
A vr game alright .btw I have   all merch
Dude fanf 7 is a fanf vr
Everyone: "IT'S FINALLY OVER!!"

Scot: *bursts in room holding a pile of games.

"  "
Are you going grey because of this? Looks good. Have fun in the rabbit hole.
actually jeremy never died. in fnaf 1 phone guy says "Its amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe" implying that Jeremy survived
I'm actually losing brain cells just listening to FNAF theories
I see a handprint on Freddys left eye
*3 years later*:
We finally finished, for real this time, the FNAF Theory series.

New FNAF game comes out
0:05 haha lmao
who won that merch and personalized note?
Where's THE NO GOD PLZ NO MEME OF OFFICE 
NO GOD NO NO GOD PLZ NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
RRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
MatPat: WE FINISHED FNAF!


Scott: Well about that


MatPat: Am I a joke to you?
Mat didn‚Äôt see the shoe inside of Freddy
Blum house was gonna make fnaf movie? Xd
Is anyone going to say that they are excited about the game
After the teaser I made a fnaf  Funtime foxy snout,ears,cheeks, and bow tie but mangle is better than Funtime foxy anyway but Funtime foxy is secondüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüê∫üê∫üê∫üê∫üê∫üê∫
No one:
Absolutely no one I kid you not:

Matpat and Scott: BUT WAIT
Micheal Scott reference
Oh God why
So, you‚Äôre finally awake, you tried to cross the border.
#SaveYourInternet
MatPat: Finally were finished
Scott: Posts teaser
MatPat: ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!
Heh heh. Lobe lad.
Do not say God's name in vain!
0:07 me:yes yes YES YES YES YEEES
Doesnt Elizabeth (???? ;-;) aka baby??? Sound like peppa pig?
Matpat: *releases FNAF 7 prediction video and is spot on*
Scott: *under breath* 
damn it
Ya guys, fanf is dead and should be left that way
VR game really
Scott will not let this fandom die, my God.
The chaos theory is an unpredictable factor that can completely break down somebodys plan,for an example everybody notices an assassin at the same time if you link this to the fnaf theories you made,   nice symbolism
Purple guy was sentenced to infinite  FNAF purgatory but he dragged Matpat down with him
No No G  O  D   N   O
What about the things in the background that look like animatronics if you brighten the picture
Remember me
rip fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaank
MatPat: Scott isnt going to make anymore fnaf games


Scott: Hold my beer
(10+ new fnaf games come out)
Yay another fnaf season for mattpat.
10:32 there's a shoe on the right of Freddy's endo skeleton
0rgn sounds like origin to me maybe enards origin
When did he turn from a theorist to a teacher
Everyone: Wow.. FNAF is finally over, huh?
Scott: Well yes, but actually no.
Everyone: Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
Wait I‚Äôm getting confused your using the grave stone where the kid Jeremy died in not the guard
This is really interesting! But I'm pretty sure that every picture of "Ennard" you mentioned was actually Ballora, after she got scooped. I know people probably already told you this. I really appreciate how much research you put into every video you do though.
Matpat and everyone else, do yall know Scott has a YouTube that's been posting videos the past month?
matpat did you put one slice of pizza in the pizza box at 0:50 cuz there are 8 slices of pizza on a normal pizza and there has been 7 games of fnaf so he has only eaten 7 slices? hmmmmmm
Mattpat: it's finally ove-

Scott: kicks down door HEEEERE'S SCOTTY
In 6:04 is that a skull? In the bottom left
Bagus
What if they were talking about the child Jeremy and not the nightguard
I am unsure about this, but the fact that all the other teaser images have such a long URL tag and the final teaser image out of the typos is just 4 letters long, it could be possible that if you rearrange the letters and then put them into the URL bar of scottgames.com, you might get some more teaser images. I mean, it's Scott Cawthon, so that would totally be possible.
You might even get the instructions of how to rearrange the letters in the other teaser images, the text of the first teaser or the websites source code.
What do you think, MatPat?
This would be my "Step 3 Analysis"
Honestly shocked you didn't just title this video "yes I'm making another one"
The animatronic head is actually real and the company that made it is Creative Engineering Inc. Their Characters are one of the most realistic animated characters out there. I've been there and the workshop is amazing.
Mat why do u hate doing this.
If you inspect the Help Wanted teaser on Scott's website, the code says "Remember Jeremy"
Well you have a lot of theories to do
He protec

He attak

But most importantly 

We thought he wouldn‚Äôt come back
After seeing Dawko, 8bitryan playing the demo at a convention and the trailer its becoming more clear that this is not what matpat had thought. In the demo there were 2 modes:


1: this was when you had to operate on bonnie from fnaf 1


2: you become a security guard at Fnaf1 location


point is that the trailer and the demo has become clear that this is not about 2 technicians its about the previous employees who have been working with Freddy Fazbears.


Let me explain.


In the theory he found coded message inside showing about jeremy's death in the bite of '87, i can tell that the security guard that was in the fnaf 2 trailer is the same guy as the security guard in fnaf 2 because at the beginning is showed that there was a job application on the same time when the 'new improved pizzeria' showed at the paper before starting your first night so there would be no previous employees then. In Fnaf 1 on the other hand, has a different view in phones guy talk in night 3 he said that 'employees don't last that long here' this suggests that in Help wanted we are playing as the old employees who were killed in the incident of being stuffed in a suit.


Next, we have the technicians in Sister location the technicians who we see in the trailer is not the one who were taking in the secret message because once they were shut down they were never coming back again trying to survive again. So the technicians are employed ones who has not clue what is lurking behind their job application which would lead to the technicians hiding away in afton's home (after all sister location is the basement of Aftons house) where they were hunted by the funtime animatronics (and the nightmares) in the trailer. soon later they get killed and presented on the stand for Michael in night 5. And by that they were hanged, not suicidal.


Th truth about Help Wanted is that it sticks to its name, new employees coming in surviving and soon one was killed another help wanted job poster pops up, this game takes the history of the deaths of the previous employees slipping to the job which the shouldn't be there in the first place.


Feel free to share your opinions.

Warning for the faint of heart that there is a jumpscare in the video around 10:55 - 10:58.
Isnt this fnaf 8 because of ultimate custom night?
Mat: So Fnaf is over now right?

Scott: Well yes, but actually no.
16:03 just do it

Therapist: Mat you have a problem. 

Mat: Wears bear onesie on episode.
Yes! new theorist
I think Scott is trying to kill Matt Patt with his games
So... Sirius dies in Sister Location, Dumbledore in 6, and Lupin, Tonks, Fred and Bellatrix in 7?
This guy is hilarious!!!
Matpat: this is the final theory 

scott: makes FNAF 7 

Matpat: am I a joke to you?
I thought we were done, damn
I knew it wasn't over
nOOOOOOOOOOO
Matpat: ah THIS IS THE REAL FINAL FNAF GAME THIS IS THE END 

Fnaf 8: aLlOw Me To InTrOdUcE mYsElF
I think the technicians have it better than you, not money wise, but work wise.
5:51 look at his hands
10:57 ... Thanks for that . . .
How did I miss this.
Matpat:finishes theory for fnaf

Scott:makes another game 

Matpat:*Insert shocked pikachu face here*
Surprisingly not yet.
I remember when I first saw the teaser I was like oh matpat is gonna be angry as satan
NOOOOOOOO...
The cool part is if u went to insomnia this year but I think there could be something in the preview of the game u could play FNAF for VR personally u dint but lots of people did
2017
Matpat: This is my last FNAF video
Everyone: Ok seems legit
2018:
Matpat: This is finally the true ending of FNAf
Everyone: Ok....
2019: 
Matpat: (Makes a FNAF video)
Everyone: wtf
Remember he always comes back
no stopping i love five night
Theoreview
14:47 actually, that‚Äôs a Creative Engineering animatronic of Paul McCartney that was never finished in the 80s.
Matpat: Goodbye Fnaf! It was fun while it lasted! 

Scott: I'm sorry what? I couldnt hear you over making another game
So have you learned lesson mat pat at saying this is the end
*taps matt pat * take a break go burn in fnaf 6
Poor MatPat
I have a theory baldi is the kid from the mangle minigame
moment when you realize fnaf had so many theories the budget of Matt editing went out so he used his real self
Jermy runner aka Hawkeye
What if the kid from the bites brother works at it!
adn 0rgn sounds like organ
Cums when he says filthy frank
I clicked on this for the sole purpose of seeing MatPat lose his mind
MatPat's been stuffed!
One video for Kingdom Hearts because it's too complicated with regards to lore, but over 20 for FNaF?
wow just wow 102 fnaf theorys
Again.... Again just... You have a problem..... Are you just adicted to fnaf??? Like what's your problem... You need help .............,. Like too much (this is not hater comment I'm just wondering if you need help)
At this point I'm almost certain that Scott is just extending the game's lifespan for the sole purpose of torturing Matpat
You know the game is the 8th fnaf game right
MAT-
I was watching Markiplier's playthrough of Fnaf 2 again, and he mentioned how

"Wait, then why are the old animatronics broken??? The prequel theory is pretty much canon, but why are they still broken?" Something like that,

but you pretty much have summed all of that up at this point;
but what if during that time, they had to fix them up to reuse them for the Fazbear's when it was brought back afterwards?

I feel like this might be obvious and I probably am just forgetting a lot of stuff from your previous videos or maybe even this one due to a migraine, but I was just thinking about it and thought I'd mention it! Qwq I don't have Twitter, which is why I posted here too... ;^;
excuse m-
The game is real FNAF 7 the game it is not over FNAF 8
Me: Finally, the FNAF series is over.
Scott:
Me:
Scott:
Me:
Scott: Hold my beer.
Me: OH COME ON
Quem √© do brasil da like
3:18 yeah, copyright issues
What happened to Austin
WE NEED MORE FNAF!
1 like is one prayer for MatPat to stop his pain
13:00 didn't know matpat was vsauce
Yessss
Hay mat pat do you remember the fnaf musicel with mark i loved that musicel
@MatPat: I found a relation to the upcoming VR FNAF game Help Wanted art and Ultimate Custom Night. In UCN, if you look behind all the characters in the menu you will see the exact same design as you do in the background of the HW artwork. The ONLY difference is that UCN's is warped. Has anyone else noticed this?
Since when did Matpat narrate the theory on screen?  Is this a new style?  It sort of feels like I'm watching a tv show now.
Whenerver MatPat is sitting on the couch we know something very bad happened.
13:31 baby doing a whip
Bonnie
MATPAT ITS ME
MatPat: thank god I finally finished this story

Scott: hold my dead child
Nice pj's!
I also love the popsocet
My name is Jeremy
Here‚Äôs what I think, William or Jeremy or Mike or whoever gets captured is in prison, haunted by his exposure at the locations, going INTO MADNESS!!! Feel free to correct me.
i feel like scott cawthon is making all these games just to troll matpat
Nooooooooo!
Didn't you notice the hight of player in ballora gallery in sister location FNAF what if it's just like charlie in books.
Example-you play as the kid version in some parts and since you watch cartoons after work it makes sense that you are at least someone with the mind of a child sure you can be crawling in ballora gallery in sister location FNAF but what if all the editions share a memory database somehow.
I know it's quite far fetched but it did stand out a little.
I don't know if anyone noticed, but on Freddy's face from the teaser, you can make out the shape of two fingers, as a reference to brighten up freddy's face from the first game.
but hey this is just a theory a game theory
Matpat:Yes im finally finished with FNAF!

Scott:Well yes but actually no.
Who is springtrap anyways???
Here's the thing I would hate if it was just vr but I feel like Scott will make one that's not vr
matpat : connection terminated I'm sorry to interrupt you Scott but you were not here just to receive the gift neither have you been called here by the individual you assume been called here for a labyrinth of sounds smells misdirection in misfortune a maze with no exit a room with no price you don't even realize you're trapped your lust for blood has been driving in circles chasing the cries of some game always seems so near but you'll never find it none of you will this is where your story ends this ends for all of us and communication


SCOTT CAWTHON  AND FNAF : I ALWAYS COME BACK
So I went back to your vid when you said sister location is under fnaf 4,and baby is in fnaf 4 do you think baby climb out of sister location to fnaf 4.
Matpat: "I did about 25 videos about FNAF and I will never talk about it again."
 


Scott: "Hold My PIZZA."
Now I‚Äôm waiting for teaser images theorists
Watches vidio Yare Yare Daze
Wair, can scott make a fnaf with matpat as the protagonist?
My names jeremy waaaaaaiiiiit
MatPat: AND THATS MY FINAL THEORY FOR FNAF!
Scott: HOLD ONTO MY EXOTIC BUTTERS
Im now rewatching this and if you look under the every thing (is) working as intended   you can see what looks kinda like the puppet  or enard
THIS IS CONFUSING!
Yaaaaaaaassss
Clap clap clap
"Everything is working as intended!" 
Hey mat i was watching this vidio and i saw you said the two workers were scared for there life but when i looked at the quote we knew it was from fnaf 2 so i think this is coming from the puppet because in fnaf two the original fnaf caracters (bonny freddy chica and foxy)where all close to the exit door so this sounds like this was something the puppet told the readers thats it please contact me if theres anything else
This is creepy
I FOUND IT Mr Theoryst under when you showed a zomed in line that said remember jerm UNDEr IT is more letters i only realised it ( 8:23 sorry i have bad spelling)
u miss one part in freddys face theres a hand!
Mattpat: "The series has finally ended."
Scott Cawthon: "Nah, man, I gotta pay my rent." makes more fnaf games
0:05
It's time to STOP
MatPat: ah yes finally done with those fnaf theorys 
1 year later and Scott finally sees matpat‚Äôs last fnaf theory 
Scott: NOT TODAY MATPAT! ITS MY JOB TO ANNOY YOU WITH FNAF GAMES! I MUST MAKE MOOOREE!
MatPat: I think ima watch some good ol‚Äô TV 

SCOTT: OH MATPAT I HAVE A....
MATPAT: no please no I thought I was done...
SCOTT: I HAVE THE EXOTIC BUTTERS AND A COMPUTER! IM GONNA MAKE A FNAF GAME!
MatPat: no no...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
       the end! 
HAHAHAHA
Matpat: Fnaf is finally over

Scott: MiSs mE AsShOlEs
Hey Matt, I just wanted to add on to your theory, I disagree with the theory that mangle was a dog, after listening to voice lines, I think it may be possible that mangle is a creation of two ressianace put together. For one of mangles lines are"now I get to play take apart and put back together" not to mention the amatronic has two heads. I doubt matt will read this but I wanted to mention another voice line from nightmare freddy,I can't remeber it exactly but it says something discussing nightmare fred hiding in purple guys shadow, this sounds like pg felt some type of jealousy towards the character
At this point, Scott really just needs to reboot everything.
spring trap is gone from the fnaf vr teaser
The sister location bots are the fnaf 4 bots. Remember you talked about those discs inside the fun times in an old theory. They made the character think that they were nightmares when they were actually the fun times
Scott: makes another fnaf game

MatPat: trying to figure out what to do with all the money he‚Äôs about to make with these new fnaf theories
Matpat the game is out
LOUD NOISES!
I have a theory of hello neighbor, my theory is the secret of the golden apple.Here is my theory, be careful it is big

Theory of me: In the ALPHA 4 version we have a gramophone with a panel with a guy and under his arms have a 4 other smaller but the 4th falls. Then, always in the ALPHA 4 you can find cubes of reds and greens and yellows and whites but the first three are bright colors but the white is not a bright color so it appears from the others as with the 4 guy on the panel near the gramophone and the last he falls. now I'll talk about the beta 3: there is in the supermarket level at the caise (the end of the level) a panel with 4 eggs but the 4th is open and there is a golden apple inside so it's not the same of the others . And there are 4 manes in the neighbor's house but one of them is in a position to fall as the pannau with 4 men. Conclusion number 4 has to do with the golden apple. maids in the family of the neighbor there are 4 members as with the story of the 4 personages and the last one falls, but in the family the only member who died in falling was the daughter of the neighbor like they see at the end of hello neighbor hide and seek. so here is my theory! sorry for my spelling is google translation make these :)
9:50
‚ÄúI will not make another theory‚Äù

^This phrase is now always a lie in my book
He actually sounds annoyed
Kindergarten 2
the urls wont work
Wow this game is still alive?
Matpat: Finally solves FNAF

Scott: Im about to end this mans whole career
stop
My name is Jeremy     ...yaaaaa
i was watching a few vids on YouTube when I heard the word maps... what if you take the image you were mainly looking at and put is a sphere just like what they do when making maps? just a thought ‚Ä¶ it would explain the grid in the back??
12:36 You are dead, not big surprise.
Whats next Scott Fnaf infinity war
Matt: FINNALLY. I CAN BURRY THIS THEORY ONCE AND FOR ALL

Scott: HOLD. MY. BEAR.
There should be a class taught by mat pat so that I can actually understand all the lore, there‚Äôs so much in this game. We have homework of playing the games, finding the clues ourselves, I dunno. That‚Äôd be pretty cool and helpful. (.

Scott challenged MatPat again?
Love the videos!!!! But just one thing, you can't complain about the one thing that made you popular, I mean come ooonnnnn 8 or more games isn't that big of a deal üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ouf
Oh god not another one
Scott uses "new game" on MatPat...It's very effective!
HE DYED HIS HAIR
Yes
When will we get the fnaf battle royale
my name is honey
‚ÄúThe games actually been finished for months, and I‚Äôve just been waiting for Matpat to hit publish on his theory from my teaser‚Äù
I think that might be inside the jukebox in fnaf 2 where ennard appears
No no oh god no!
Is this a hint that you‚Äôre making merch.....
Wait there's a movie
Matpat: yes I done with fnafü•≥
Scott: hold my Freddy plush
No.. Playstation 4 VR... 





NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
its fnaf 8 not fnaf 7 matpat
Oh
No fn
Matpat: Announces that he's finally done with Fnaf theories

Scott: Releases teasers for yet another Fnaf game

Matpat: 
any1 think it will work on the vive?
No god no god no god no
1 year later
god no god no
Intro plays
LOL
Oh god no good no!!
Fnaf: into madness is actually just a compilation of all the game theorist fnaf videos
pause at any time between 2:39 and 2:40 and just look at matpat...
Filthy frank we miss you
first 15 seconds no no noooo nooooooo no noo noooo no no no no noooooooooooo
Mat:fnaf is over

Scott:good guess but actually no.
Dear Game theorists, thanks so much for my fave fnaf theories! I am subscribed ‚Ä¢*‚Ä¢
He should be in the FBI because of his detective skills
MatPat: I'm soooo done with fnaf rn! It's over! Let it die
Scott: Oh...w-well...I did make a new game but I-I guess since you don't want i-
MatPat: Give me the game, Scott!!!!
Scott:  ^Throws game before cowering in the corner^
I loved your office reference at the begging of the video. NNNOOOOOOO!!!!
Gt ur awsome gt stands for game theory
I don‚Äôt like the idea of vr because I don‚Äôt want to buy vr but I like the new game idea

Edit: by aaying I like the new game means that I like FNAF into madness
I think scott wans matpat to do one more fnaf theory vid coz hes still not releasin what matpat shown in the vid yet lol
I think at this point Scott is just making new FNaF to make sure Mat doesn't sleep. This is personal now
Im going to have a heart attack when i try it on vr.. >-< seems scary
Matpat, 
in the fnaf 3 bad ending, we see a head Possibly that of Golden freddy's lit up in the backround,
if that is golden freddy, then in the good ending, he is missing, 
he was not burned, but possibly destroyed, but his soul I'm aware golden freddy is a girl seems to stick around,
meaning Henry did not eliminate all the souls?
Idk, just wondering.
matpat‚Äôs level of tired is the same as me walking into stats to retake it for the 6th time
Where do i buy that book
There's fingerprints on Fazbear's right eyebrow for some reason.
LEGEND NEVER DIES
Genius
Where is the suspense in this video like the other, the video felt like a documentary
Theory: It is finally over...
FNAF: It's rewind time.
mat pat: they stole $17 million
scott: releases new game
scott:
modern problems require modern solutions
MatPat: Got that out of the wa-

ScottCawthon-breaks down the door I'm Back

MatPat-Noooooooooooooooo
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm betting what happened.

Me: You need to make a new game.

Scott: Uh...

Me: Matpat is moving on to Fortnite 

Scott: Hold my beer.
Just binged the whole FNAF series again- STILL as amazing as ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
That FILTHYFRANK SHOUTOUTüñ§üñ§
Fooking jumpscares in this video are more scarier that in the the game it self because I'm not expecting it.
WAIT MAT!
THEORY


THOSE TILES MIGHT NOT BE TILES!
THEY COULD BE SCREENS!!!!!
‚ÄúTheory Review‚Äù

Me: INTENSIFIES
Matt:FNAF is finally put to rest

Scott:hold my beer
MatPat: I‚Äôm finally done with fnaf games
Scott: Hold my animatronics
Mat pat: haha hahaha HAHAHAHAHA, IVE FINALLY DEFEATED YOU

Scott: silly mortal.... I was only using 0.5 percent of my power...
When it says ‚Äúremember Jeremy‚Äù couldnt it also be read as ‚Äúremember, Jeremy‚Äù? Like telling Jeremy to remember or asking him if he remembers?
11:46 as soon as he stepped offscreen I knew it was coming
I have a theory.



You play as jeremy in this and at the end you die... so the people say remember jeremy because he died in it..




BUT THATS JUST A THEORY... A GAAAME THEORY..



Thanks for reading
You SAID...it was going to BE...your LAST FNAF THEORY
GOD DAMMIT JUST LET IT DIIIIIIEEE
Scott:NO YOI HAVE WON MATPAT HOW?!*dies*
MATPAT:sorry bud no more FnaF
FnaF fans:we shall awaken Scott*awakens scott*
Scott:know MATPAT will BURN
theory review
I love this new format
This is the first Game Theory vid I've watched in a while but I don't hate Mat's more physical presence in the video. He's got a great smile so it's not like it's unpleasant and it adds a bit of... I dunno, I don't wanna say personality but, like, closeness, I guess?
Is it weird that I'm listening to This whilst writing a story? Yes? Okay, That's normal for me.
Is it sad that ive been in love with FNAF for years now but ive never been able to play it for myself QmQ, thanks to Matt and amino i can stay sane. Thanks Matt
10:56 I can't believe I didn't see that coming ;-;
I just found that the grid lines in the back of the trailer picture are the same grid lines behind the character select in ultimate custom night
Second thing when it says remember jeremy it's like Jeremy is saying remember him not just that but it's like Jeremy said he let something in
Didn‚Äôt withered Bonnie talk about being trapped in Ultimate Custom Night
0:06 I smell new merch "sniff" yup definitely some new merch
Matt:it's over
Scott:let's tocher matt some more shall we.
No a fence
Now the questions are:
A Who are the technicians exactly?
B Who is Jeremy exactly?
C How does this all connect?
yeaaa...you lost me there
Bro with that baby teaser in the bedroom in vr I can tell this is gonna be the scariest game yet.
matpat: I'M FINALLY DONE WITH FNAF 


scott: le epicly makes vr fnaf game


matpat: NO GOD PLEASE NO. NO, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@the game theorists have you listened to all the song lyrics? they might give clues
This boi in the thumbnail be looking like ketch and mustard
Who else likes this new format
I think fnaf is mat pats hell this is gonna be a amazing game
If fnaf brings back the first animictrocics that were Burned I am done
GUYS I MAY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING PEOPLE MAY HAVE LOOKED OVER!
ok just hear me out and listen
In ultimate custom night, the animatronics talk to you after the jumpscares right?
but i was just listening through all of them and realised that a lot of them say something about "The one you shouldn't have killed". Any ideas?
(PS like so MatPat can see this comment)
IRL Matpat for theories! Man, anyone else reminded of the Super Carlin Bros with that style?
Confirmed VR Help Wanted.
Welcomeback fnaf
Matpat :no good no no no no no no no
You got stuffed in Freddy matpat
Rember me.......  Does anyone get it?
mat is doing what Micheal Scott from the office U.S. when toby comes back.
Scott: releases new game
Matpat: STOP ATTACKANIZING ME
since you mentioned The Binding of Isaac...
time to do another theory on it, right??


please?????
Random Comment:jesus loves toast because of marshmellos new song...
I loved that clapping when he sad If it is
At 5:50 under foxys head I kinda see a face I might be crazy tho
We let something in so that must mean spring trap but early form
Tiles in fanf 3
Matpat don‚Äôt trust them means the crew working on the game
Ya know, you could just use inspect element
üò≠YESSSSSS
Matt you‚Äôre so handsome
Rating category Teen only? Are you sure?
You need to stop 11:50
Why man, why the jumpscare I get scared easily u poopoo
Next video do a 5 nights at sonic game theorists
8:55 that‚Äôs baby‚Äôs voice. Hers and William Afton‚Äôs daughters voice. Baby‚Äôs voice because well there‚Äôs a little bit of Ennard in everyone and William‚Äôs daughters voice because Baby "ate" her.
Make a theory about why pokemon dont actually evolve
Who else heard him say "recycle chuck cheese pizza"
There are words under "Remember Jeremy..."
Poop in my pants young man
Fnaf battle Royale. What's next, Mario battle Royale. Oh wait, that's also a thing
matpat i know doing these fnaf series are slowly driving you insane but they are my favourite game theory videos SO IM EXCITED
Can't believe we're actually convinced that animatronics are
possesed
Even better, type in sitemap.xml and find every link
For goodness sake matpat stop the jumpscares I dont think anyone likes em xD other than that great video
I actually think a movie would be a good idea
DO MORTAL KOMBAT
The beginning is exactly what I said
You know when Scott said "Why is Tony Roy Chica missing her beak?" 
Isn't he trying to indicate that Toy Chica did the bite of 87?
I mean, I know there's no way she could bite the head of the victim from the size of her mouth and her beak being in the way, but she can peck it with her beak.
11:49 lmao i died
Scott... you‚Äôre good at what you do, but can ya move on?
Ok 2 things a the 5 animatronics in the picture only 4 of them are melted together cause it didn't show Freddy melted with them but it's almost like Freddy is there leader/care taker
The VR game is almost like ‚Äú Mario in Animatronic Horror!‚Äù
Why did he suddenly start to do this with live video?
No hello internet, welcome to game theory?
fifthly frank didn't leave youtube to become a rapper for this mat.
Matpat is the best, he spends his life just for random video game crap for us, your the best
No one:



Scott cowfton:
HERE'S 29 NEW GAMES
Matpat: Man it feels so good to be done with fnaf!
Scott: maniacal laughter.
FnAf BaTtLe RoYaLe
Matpat
Markiplier
Scott


One taught me love, one taught me pain, one taught me patience
Matpat tried so hard not to laugh in the intro lol
Hey Matt so a new teaser dropped for help wanted could you pls do an analysis of it. Thnx
I feel your pain mat I also thought this series was over tooüòÇ
I swear Scott‚Äôs gonna claim the series is over, wait until Mat ‚Äúdies a happy man‚Äù and then create a new series to drive us all crazy. 
(And with no MatPat to give us a conclusion, he will have nothing to stop him.)
Scott:  reveals new fnaf trailer
Freddy: ‚ÄúWhy?!  Why master?!? WHY WON‚ÄôT YOU JUST LET ME DIE?!?
Thank you for adding filthyfrank content!
I miss the old game theory format.
NO GOD NO
16:04
Matpat: Wow i cant believe I solved the mystery.
Scott: Let's talk about that

MatPat: starts crying
Matpat u forget...... 






Fnaf always comes back
Next on my strange addiction
Scott: I can't stop making FNAF games
How are you so smart
Literally nobody:
Scott: new FNAF game!
JK Rowling: Micheal Afton had a deep sexual relationship with mangle
I love FNaF Ask Scott to make a FNaF For a game on the tablet FNaF  the chaos comes back
How fnaf theories work:
1. MatPat goes over the trailer and says that he figured out the story
2. The game comes out and MatPat realizes that he‚Äôs completely wrong
3. He makes another theory in the new game
4. A new game comes out and throws everything MatPat did out the window
MatPat: I HAVE FINALLY FINISHED THE BIGGEST THEORY IN HISTORY
Scott Cawthon: Hold my non-alcoholic beverage
MatPat: cries in a corner
ITS OUT!!
Scott: Announces New FNAF Game

MatPat: * demon noises *
Matt : I‚Äôm done with fnaf 
Scott : Hold my beer
no one:
scott: releases another fnaf game
Who else thinks matpat looks good in the Freddy suit just me..ok
Theory üëè Review üëè
Oh my Markimoo, looks like you have a new game to play. ùí¢ùëúùëúùíπ ùìÅùìäùí∏ùìÄ
I honestly think help wanted means the workers died and someone(im looking at you afton) is trying to hide it.
I Think that the bars are the ones in ultimate custom nights loading screen
We called it. Thanks Scott
yup.
definitely
This series never truly ends
It's time for a new Era of fnaf.
The detail Put in...
guess hows back back agin
just when you think fnaf is over, Scott goes ahead and adds a whole list of whats yet to come. Yikes.
All the melted animatronics are from the pizzeria simulator game where they were all stored and when it was set on fire they all got connected
MatPat: And that‚Äôs the end of FNAF

Scott: Hold my exotic butters.
Fans: Scott how many fnaf games are you going to make?

Scott: Yes
matt: ‚Äú Im so happy I can stop doing FNAF‚Äù
scott comes out of his freddy onesie
scott: Are you challenging me?
Matpat: ‚Äúit‚Äôs finally over! I‚Äôm not doing this anymore‚Äù




Scott: ‚Äúhold my beer!‚Äù
MatPat: no, no, no god, no, no, no god, no, nooo, nooooooooooooooo! 
I died, I am dead
matpat: it took 30 years, but i'm finally done with FNAF

scott cawthon: makes FNAF battle royale

matpat: Am I a JoKE tO YOu?
So many different comments that say the same thingü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
i knew it...


I F***ING KNEW HE WOULD MAKE ANOTHER ONE!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
R.I.P Purple gay
Killed so many innocent children.
matt you become so cringy i cant even be proud to watch you man
It actually IS kind of Afton since him and anti - vincent share the same body.
"Filthy Frank, we miss you," Amen to that
YOOO if we work on freddy in the game, and get attacked by him but not killed, that may explain the handprints on freddys face in fnaf 1. We might struggle in the game and get out eventually. Just a theory idk if its true. üòÄ
8 months since a vid.
8 teasers 
CONECTION???
Scott is like that clingy ex that begs to comeback even when you thought everything was over lol
Omg that fursuits that sounds epic
I was looking for something to watch, when I saw something in my recommended. When I clicked on it, I sighed and began to watch, and there I  pondered. could it be? Is there a possibility? And then I looked throughout, this cool channel made by a handsome fellow. I found the playlist, and- Wait, there's another video? GOD DAM- We're having some technical difficulties, we'll be right back.

BTW this basically meant that, sure, you may be suffering throughout this adventure. But so am I, you see, I now have to keep watching these videos.
Time to jump right into the lore again
You could always take it off ;3
Matt has a grey hair streak from the stress
Jesus , i swear MatPat is able of buying PS4 just to play play wanted
Anyone notice how in Sister Location the animatronic say the same things? Like the biddybads saying "hello in there" and fun time freddy also saying hello in there?
1:11 God , i didn't even think of that Lol
To think this all happened because people on the internet told some guy his Christian friendly video game was creepy.
St is alive
I think Scott or someone said that in the game we will be able to visit A LOT of locations of the fnaf franchises locations




Matpat:
I SOLVED THIS FRANCHISE! 

Scott:
NOPE 
I love this new editing with mat Pat on the screen not as a photoshop version of him I love this DO IT MORE PLEASE
Crawling, in, the vents...
These rooms, they will, not seal.
Fear is how he falls.
Confusing what is real.

Something inside me is pulled beneath the surface.
Infusing. Confusing.
This lack of self-control, I fear, is never ending...
Controlling, oh, how I can't see...
I can't seem to find myself again, the costume's closing in.
I felt this pressure before, the suit's insecure...!

My ennards endlessly being pulled apart upon me.
Extracting... Reacting...
Against my will I'm forced into ever introspection.
Its haunting, knowing "It's me..."
I can't seem to find myself again, the costume's closing in.
I felt this pressure before, the suit's insecure...!

Crawling, in, the vents...
These rooms, they will, not seal.
Fear is how he falls.
Confusing what is real.
Crawling, in, the vents...
These rooms, they will, not seal.

Infusing. Confusing, what, is real.
MatPat: Fnaf is finally over 
Scott: I always come back
A wild MatPat appeared!!
Go Scott Cawthon!
The wild MatPat used Final Theory!
The attack misses!
Scott Cawthon, use Fnaf Teasers!
Its super effective!
Critical hit!
The wild MatPat fainted!
Scott Cawthon leveled up to level 100!
This is probably a stupid question but what exactly is a triple A game/AAA game
I loved your Undertale theories they're my favorite!
Scott Cawthon: "I ALWAYS COME BACK"
Instead of prison bars, how about a camera, as most games with the cameras have those types of background line
i miss the old type theories
I really like the new formula this episode used
do the witness for a game theory
12:00 can't find filthyfrank meme comments
Notice how it says "with frequent jumpscares bla bla bla and the text You Are Dead." It says You are Dead like not You died like other games but You are Dead. Could that reffer to the technichians being dead?
The reference of The Office thou
What if its just a VR game? Like he just maded for fun not for clues or anyhting.
scott good troll feed it well
16:05
Nice Frank reference there, matpat
I died of cuteness over load at 7:21
Matpat: I HAVE SOLVED FNAF


Scott: N O


Matpat: Y E S 


Scott: #


Matpat: 
Now I have to rewatch all the old episodes so I can understand what‚Äôs going on in a game I haven‚Äôt cared about in 4 years

Nostalgia
Madpatt: finally its done
Scott: hahahahaahahahahahaha
the pure ‚Äúwhat kind of fuckery is this‚Äù energy coming from matt in this one absolutely kills me
looks at the screen
sees what Scott said
Wow, that‚Äôs hilarious
Scott: making new fnaf game 

Matt: puts gun in front of head
F in the chat for my boy matpat
was that a bad a paraody of THE OFFICE? HOW DARE YOU!
i've been watching this since i was 14 and im still hooked lmao
there's still more books on the way...
It‚Äôs back. AGAIAN?!? Plus hope the kid is going okay. Also the bars to me look like a pelvis. Maybe it‚Äôs just me.
MATTPATT!!!! I CHECKED THE SIGHT AND THE PICTURE HAS SO MUCH MORE THEN JUST FRRDDY BONNIE FOXY SPRING TRAP AND FUNTIME FOXY!!!! IT HAS BASICALLY EVERY SINGLE ANIMATRONIC!!! I'm not screaming at you from anger, it's from EXCITEMENT!!! yay... xD
HOLD MA BEEER !!!
What if the two technicians accedentally  create enerd and then he kills them
did anyone see the shoe in the image
OMG remember the two tech guys who got hanged in sister location ? could be those ...
Scott Just makes games to annoy you. 

imagine that lol
Whoever edited the video, you did a really good job! Still feels like a classic Game Theory video, while making it so much better!
Matpat: it‚Äôs over it‚Äôs finally over.
Scott: Actually there‚Äôs going to be more games and more books.
Matpat: Am I a joke to you?
Edit: Thank you for the likes
Scott will keep you employed till the end of Youtube, Matpat
I thought Jeremy was Bonnie?
*Insert obligatory joke*
I love the new editing Matt is using a lot more interactive
I have been waiting for this moment for an eternity
Finally it‚Äôs here
Remember back when SEGA and Nintendo were the two biggest rivals in gaming history? 

And now it's MatPat and Scott?
When I brightened the picture and when you mentioned the lines and how they were weird I started to think they look like blueprints it makes sense there are two technicians so maybe they had blueprints to something or someone. More on the blueprints it looks like the shadows could be dust that had collected over time or maybe those shadows is a spill from a drink or it could just be ya know shadows...
MatPat:Finally the FNAF Lore is complete
Scott:Hold my new game teaser that I just made
Can you explained how when you press D+C and plus you beat the night immediately
MatPat:im finally done!  


Scott:I don‚Äôt think so!
Please read the comments section for short dialog stories abt matpat vs Scott
I think It would be cool if you planed as a Detective searching what happened during those times and then he talks to some of the victim's parents and trying to survive long enough for him to find the full story
I thought fnaf2 pizzeria was scrapped
I saw this game at pax. I thought it was an unofficial game when I saw it. I don't know if it was a full game or just a teaser area.
Is matpats hair goin grey or naw?
Please do Fran bow Game Theory. We still waiting for it.
My vote 

MOVIE!!!!
im not liking the matpat in the middle of the screen. i enjoy the crazy editing and funny stuff while still getting through to his point. with this boring editing style, i often zoned off while staring into the screen.
He protec

He attack

But most importantly, he always come bac..
MatPat: thinks he solved the FNAF lore
Scott: makes another game

Outstanding move

Edit: Holy crap! Did not expect that many likes, thank you guysüòÖüíô
Matpat, making final fnaf theorys since 3000 b.c
Matpat: Im finally done with FNAF.







Scott:But waittttt thats just a theory.
Love your new representative style :) keep it up
It seems like we will play as the technicians based on the mangle vr game at PAX (crawling through vents), as well as the repairing games.
MatPat: Burries self on the ground
 
Matpat:IM FINALLY DONE!

Scott: 
Scott: NOT TODAY MAT!
Yay! I really like this series tho!
Am I the only person  entertained by Matpat's intros???
Really liking the new format.
this format sucks

slow and mumbly
unedited old man grunts on camera 2 hours
Oh you know you love to milk it.
Ahsod dixbwhdoc shevfievdkcbdicbf I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS AGHGGHGJDHRVDIDBFKCOENVDOXNDBDIDECEIDJFOMF CHSKDBD
I been in a game theory coma for a while (by that i mean i haven't been on the channel in like, 6 months) aaaaaand what's with mat's new live action-y editing?
And now the teaser trailer is out so have fun matt can't wait to see you in the mental asylum
This is what‚Äôs called ‚Äújob security ‚Äú üòÇ
Mat: I FINALLY SOLVED EVERYTHING

Scott: *BOOM bursts through the door*...aRe YoU sUrE aBoUt ThAt?!
Honey doesn‚Äôt work on creepyhollows shop
Scott: sees a pizza

MatPat: oh no...please dont....

Scott: I HAVE AWOKEN-
Don't EVER say you're done with FNAF, MatPat.
It doesn't work.
Mat: "WE FINISHED IT!!!!!" 
Scott: "hold my red bull"

OMFG 570 LIKES THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!
Scott will keep on making games as long as MatPat is there to theorize.
"Pizzaria simulator is the last fnaf game"

Scott : hold my pizza
ok but imagine.
"into madness" comes out.
protagonist's name is matt.
MatPat be like the BillNye of theories XD Liking the greenscreen style :P
MatPat: I'm finally done with FNAF!


Scott:.... Well actually-
Matpat "No, no no no no NO!"


Inner Matpat: YES YES YES YES YES MOOONEEEEEEEEEEY
LOOK 
THE ONLY WILLIAM WE NEED CURRENTLY 
IS MUTANT MAN FROM RESIDENT EVIL 2
I love how the intro bit is just him yelling 'no!'
I can't tell if MatPat really hates FNaF now, or if he's just kidding.
0:41 sorry, that might have been me.
Into the ‚ÄúMat-ness‚Äù :D Get It?
geez. Every time I look at the picture of Freddy with the bloodshot eyes, it scares me.
Is anyone else just binge watching all the other fnaf theories ?
That voice crack on 4:29
0:06 it seems like MatPat is William Afton from ultimate custom night and Scott is "the one he shouldn't have killed," making more fnaf stuff that MatPat has to cover so the the series is "finished," rework his timeline, and wait until the next fnaf item to come out or for Scott to say that he quit (which he probably won't anyway). It's a perfect metaphor!!!
Quickly matpat made a joke about a vr fnaf game a while ago
Couldn't the 5 animatronics melted together in the teaser be the 5 things put together and locked in the box? It was talked about in the FNAF 6 what's in the box video.
WOOBADYDOO
Ya know why its called Chaos Theory?
Cuz it has been such a Chaos with the fnaf theories!
Get it? K ill go home now
Good like all the time
Matpat: The end for FNAF!
Scott: Hold my murderous animatronics.
Scott is like Elon musk

Game Theory: "Throws Fnaf in water"
Scott: "Watches fnaf drown"
Scott: "Laughs"
WAIT!!!

5 animatronics burned together

Remember the candy cadet?

All the stories were about 5 thing being put together
You guys tried lighting up the VR poster thingy. Because i think i see something to the right of chicka and just in general in all the corners
Matpat we are done with fnaf 
We are done with fnaf again
We are finally actually done
Omg Scott we are done 
Now SCOTT STOP IM GETTING STRESSED I HAVE GREY HAIR THANKS TO YOU!üêªü¶äüê§

AHHHHHHH I'M SO EXCITED I WAS JUST TSAYIN THE OTHER DAY THAT I MISSED FNAF
So we are going to get in a sut ü§Æü§Æthat‚Äôs bescusihg!?!
Dye out your grays bro
Fanf should have stopped at 4
SANS
I really like this format of you talking to a camera.
At this point Mat just looks .tired.
Matpat: Im done with fnaf
Scott: "releases new fnaf 7"
Matpat: Am i a joke to you?
MatPat: We finished all FNAF¬¥s story!!!
Scott: What are we celebrating?
Matt: "And that's it, the full story of FNAF...."

Scott: *makes FNAF new game

Matt: 
MatPat: WE FINALLY FINISHED FNAF!!!!!

Scott: You sure about that?

MatPat: no. No.... no no no NOOOOOOOO
MatPat: I finally finished it!!!

Scott: time to make a new one

MatPat: GODAMIT SCOTT
If MatPat hasn't became a psychopath by now, i dont know when he will.

Its really impressive  that matpat can make a 18 minute long theory from a teaser image
Please read the comments section for short dialog stories abt matpat vs Scott
It could just be new surgeon simulator :D
perfect intro XD
This game sucks
Fnaf community:[insert here]
Matpat is having a crisis and it shows
is matt slowly losin mat mind
Trailer is now officially out
I never play any of the other Freddie's game other than the original. However I always watch MatPats videos on the lore because he makes it interesting.

0:06 summer reading
MatPat: There we are, a nice, satisfying conclusion
Scott: Hold My Beer
Matpat: That's it. It's been done. I've done all the theories possible in the universe.

*A NEW CHALLENGER APROACHES*

Matpat: 
Matpat: Makes an awesome new theory

Scottyboi: Releases new fnaf game

 
Anybody notice the hand print
He protecc
he Atacc
But most importantly..
NOBODY EVER THOUGHT HE WOULD COME BACC!!!
Matpat: Fnaf is finished, right?
Scott: Well yes but actually no
5:53 Ha you looked
Scott: Omae wa mou shindeiru 
Matpat and his theories: NANI!?
Chucks cheese= FNAF
Chucky= Freddy
Weird yellow chicken = Chika
Purple guy on every ride= Bonnie


...
Game: So this is the end of FNAF..
Scott Cawthon: Hold my beer
Matt: finally done!

Scott some where in a cave: dO I SmElL rElaXatIOn?
Matpat: Finally!!! I may rest now

Scott: NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!
There was not Freddy in sister location...Funtime Freddy but not Freddy ....so the timeline doesn‚Äôt match since  the character wouldn‚Äôt have been in sister location....
2:13 instead of stuffing kids into animatronics (sorry for misspelling) it's now the other way around "let's see how Freddy likes being stuffed into a dead kid"
Didn‚Äôt the victim of the Bite of 87 not die though? Didn‚Äôt phone guy specifically mention LIVING without the frontal lobe?
Jeremy=venjfull sole
Definitely the battle Royale game
who else thought ultimate custom night was fnaf 7
aggressively no's
Man, so many original comments here.
NO GOD NO NO GOD NO NO... GOD NO!
JEREMYS MY NAME
Matpat: fnaf is over


Scott: laughs in sith lord

90% "Matpat: its finally ov-" 
         "Scott: Hold my beer"
Game theory: *Starts doing more livestreams, running out of Indie horror games
Scott Cawthon: I‚Äôm about to fuel this man‚Äôs whole career
I've been here since the start, who would have guessed like 4 years later I would still be watching MatPat suffer with fnaf again
Matpat: I FINALLY SOLVED IT

Scott: Wait, that's illegal
MatPat:okay Scott thanks for not making another....


Scott:*makes like 80 more games*Your welcome


MatPat:üòÉüòÄüòÖ help me please
MatPat: Yes. I unscrambled FNAF's lore!
Scott: Hold my beer
Matpat: no no no no

Also matpat: makes 3+ more videos about it
God have mercy on Matthew Patrick's Soul
Mat Pat i 1UP,T IT  for you guys and found out that there is a new anamtronic wolf
Scott: makes game on ps4
People who are on mobile: am I a joke to you?
Wait ik that he deleted the thumbnail but the melting part is one of candy cadets stories
8:56 lEt mE IiIiNnNn......    is enard Eric andre???
Why don't you like fnaf? üò¢üò¢
Dude... the fnaf series is so old... when will Scott learn... move on
But I thought Jeremy was Bonnie
While I think your point on the prison bars is interesting, I don't think that was the intension:
I checked the (new, fanart free) image out, and, having tweaked the contrast as per usual, it looks significantly more like two layers of grid squares. They aren't rectangular slots, they are overlapping images of perfect squares. You can tell, because one set of lines that forms perfect lines is brighter than all the lines that aren't involved, which also form perfect squares. This can be seen particularly well towards the bottom of the image.


No, I don't have a better suggestion as to what they are - you are way better at this whole "figuring things out" deal than I - but I don't think prison is the answer. Just saying.
today my friend looked at Freddy with his stomach open and he saw a shoe, i also saw an eye. This means this game takes place during the time when Afton stuffed the kids in the suits.
Did no one see the shoe in Freddy? No? Okay
Lol, Scott is just trolling you by now. Scrolling through the comments everyone just joking like: "Mat: I'm done now with fnaf
Scott: not yet! (Aka hold my [insert item] or well yes, but no)"

Poor Matpat, fnaf is gonna make more theories happen. Probably wondering when the fnaf will end, aren't you? (Wish I saw this sooner) now Imma make a joke

Random person for sake of joke (rpfsoj): here lies Matpat, finally done with fnaf...
Scott: here, hold this [insert whatever you think he was holding] THERE'S VR MAT!
Rpfsoj: 
Mat:  oh come on, Scott!
Scott and Mat: 
Me: WHY DIDN'T I KNOW OF THIS SOONER!!!
Something just hit me, what if the 5 animatronics in the teaser are the 5 missing children? And who ever seen those animatronics was the person that was convicted.I know it's a stretch but it just got me thinking.
matpat : phone rings
matpat: hello? who's th-
scott: heeeeey buddy umm i have a new vr game about fnaf , help wanted, would yo-
matpat hangs up
üòê

üëñ
üëû
This is MatPat. 
Lately he's been suffering because of a man named Scott Cawthon
Let's pray he gets better
Scott : FNAF 3 will be the final game
Also Scott : DID SOMEBODY SAY FNAF 7??
Matpat: is it over? finally!

Scott: he's finished? well better make 3 new games and a book series...
Alright. I waited a good week before I saw this and now that I'm good and drunk it's time to read the comments. 




Oh. These memes you lot are referencing are dead now...
F
MatPat - FNaF is now over

Scott Cawthon - Yell yes, but actually no.
I‚Äôm still sticking with what candy cadet said about five things becoming one! Now art work of them melting together like in a fire sound familiar ??
what if every time MatPat makes a theory Scott changes his game so that MatPat is wrong


i'd believe it
"mattpat thinks he's done? LETS FIX THAT WITH A CONTOLLED SHOCK"
Nobody:
Scott: but what about a fnaf version of fortnite
Someone who doesn‚Äôt know fnaf: why is everyone freaking out about this game?
Matpat and fnaf fandom: Y O U   D O N T   K N O W   WHAT   W E ‚Äò V E   B E E N   T H R O U G H
14:50
it looks like its not in the game but in real life




movie
Mat your clip from 0:03 to 0:13 became a meme
AWWWWWW DANG IT,SCOTT
Matt is right, I do miss Frank...
What about this? What if William Afton isn‚Äôt the one in the suit? What if he was convicted and someone else is in the sprintrap suit?
Scott wants MatPat to theorized the game
Welcome back Scott and jj
Attn. MattyPatty

I'm not smart enough to figure this one out, but I noticed something from the page source on Scottgames.com. The header includes 5 meta name tags, 3 of which are blank. See below:

<head><title>Scot0t Games</title><meta name="" contrent="Ggxcqw432"><meta name="" content="Scottgames"><meta name="" content="9Taawf32Bb"><meta name=‚Äú5sdvgHsd‚Äù content="s55Hdfcaa2"><meta name="sd3mz77fW" content="Fwxht4Scv"></head>

I couldn't help but notice that the total of 5 names is the same as the number of gravestones. Which also gives more weight to the whole "remember Jeremy" message. Are you able to crack this one?
Help Wanted? That's an understatement
Your having White hairs
Absolutely No one -

JK. Rowling - Freddy was gay

(Thx 4 the likesüëç)

Also JK. Rowling - Foxy & Springtrap had a relationship
Matt:FNAF is finally over!
Scott: Haha you thought
Can we all just appreciate how done MatPat is here? He‚Äôs just like, welp there‚Äôs another one. Lets rip off this bandaid.
if you turn the volume up, you can hear scott laughing in the distance
Matpat: finally I‚Äôm done 



Scott: hold my freddy mask
The photoshop file name is hilarious: ‚ÄúPLZ SCOTT NO MORE‚Äù
Matpat just looks 1000000000% done with Scott Cawthon


Don't blame ya.
I've only watched 1 minute and it's already the best I've ever seen
I legit thought game theory was a rip off of film theory made by someone else
14:30
ORIGIN
Scott: i always come back
the green screen is weeeeird
I have a theory that fnaf 5 is a prequel because if funtime foxy Is a pre form of mangle then wouldn't it be a prequel also sorry if you have already covered this I haven't watched a fnaf theory for a while like if you agree
I think that the name 'Help Wanted' might mean more than just a company needing employees. I think it might mean some spirits who can't let go who need 'Help' to move on.
Rip filthy frank
A new format? What is this?????
Finally no more FNAF theories..

Scott: Well yes but actually no
MatPat: It's over! It's finally OVER! WE NEVER NEED TO HEAR ABOUT IT AGAIN!!

Scott: Chops down a door Here's Scotty.
What does an animatronic do when they get sick



Scott Coughin
1 Year Later:


Dude: Hey, Scotts announced FNAF 8.
Matpat: WHHHHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
Honestly im not suprised that Matpat is getting more unhinged with every Fnaf Video
Maybe the purple man is a pedophile 
and the restaurant is actively putting technology in place to either lure children into the "safe room," or keeping an eye out for potential predators such as mangle. This explains why the purple guy is constantly looking for more and more children as you play him in all games. This is why Golden Freddie can't let the sexual assault go.
I've got a theory! 




I think MatPat is one of the dead kids that has grown up in a Freddy suit.
10:55 (jumpscare)


YOU HAVE THE INTEGRITY TO SCARE ME?!?!
if i wanna stay awake all knight ill play fnaf thanks.
I‚Äôm going to cry. Scott actually hid the link for an image in spelling errors in the source code for the teaser. IN THE SOURCE CODE. The absolute madman
0:05 my reaction when matpat uses an old meme
I love how the editor made him louder when MatPat said, Listen
One of my favorite youtube channels but please stop saying "you see", thx.
Well mat grab a paper and pen cause you're gonna be in a lot of research
You can tell MatPat Is REALLY trying not to smile in the start of the video.
I love the fnaf theories from matpat I have been watching all the game theory since the first fnaf game theory. Get matpat shirts there amazing
This better be on PC
MatPat: sits down




Scott: NO! YOU STAND UP RIGHT NOW, EGGS BENEDICT! 
I a sorry that you have to suffer but their is alot alot more is coming like 30 or 20
I swear  hes just making the games to mess with matt
I thought the bars were like retro computer stuff like 80s stuff
If you turn the contrast up you can hear MatPat sobbing the whole video.


The contrast gives you heart-ray vision.
Matpat:I finally solved fnaf

Scott: wait.. that's illegal
Matpat, I believe you've been specifically targeted by Scott.
A.. game theory... where matpat is on screen during the theory? I'm... Actually down for this
Mat Pat: thinks he finished the series

Scott Cawthon: hold my exotic butter
Matpat: FNAF is finally over
Scott: Posts teaser images
Matpat: Makes 18 minute theory video
"I'm about to ruin this whole man's carrer."- Scott~2019
MatPat: I'm finally done with this series!


Scott: I'm about to end this mans whole career
This would make sense with the lore! It's just basically plugging in some plot holes like how Star Wars did with Rogue 1
There is 2 reasons i cant win .1 YouTube on phone and no pc or mac .2 i cant install it on a non existent laptop so... LOOK AT ALL THE FOX I GIVE
Mad respect for the Filthy Frank meme...rip.
Best of luck Mat Pat. I can tell you're tired. But I truly enjoy watching each and every one of your videos. I feel your frustration, but I urge you to find excitement and thus be compelled to unpack whatever comes next. We all enjoy these videos, and it's all thanks to you and your amazing team.
Are you intending for these videos to scare people?
Instead of "five night's" at freddys, it should be called "help wanted" at freddys
Yes ITS BACK YAAAAYYY
Liked the old format much much better
That's what you get for thinking about fortnite HahaHaha
Damnit, not this again
As someone who can't tolerate actually playing scary games without panic attacks, I deeply appreciate you following the story of FNAF so I can keep up without the scares. Thanks, Theory Team, for your hard work! 
Now I'm gonna go download the thing, to try to win a hoodie! Low blood pressure sucks. I'm always cold and really need it. Lol
This is my third time watching this and the jokes still don‚Äôt get old!! MatPat, you get a clap and a half from me!
I have honey üòï
Matpat: LAST EPISODE!
Scott: nope
AGAIN MATPAT: LAST EPISODE!
Scott: no 
Matpat:....
Matpat:I finally finished the fnaf lore!!!!!
Scott:I'm bout to end this man's career
Matpat: I‚Äôve figured out the whole series

Scott: ladies and gentleman we got em
Matt: ‚ÄúTime to break out FNAF Lore for Dummies, one last time.‚Äù 

Me: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
Filthy Frank is Joji now lol
Matpat: done with the fanaf

Scott: hold my golden freddy suit please
Me: *spends 3 weeks catching up of FNAF gameplays and theories even tho it‚Äôs been over for years+ ‚Äúwow I‚Äôm glad I did that‚Äù

*new game comes out*

The entire community including me: ‚Äú*Noooooooooo*‚Äù
Mat Pat:Kirby is evil
Kirby fan base: >:O
Scott: Released Teaser
Mat Pat: Thank the gods
Literally the only things I know about Fnaf are your videos Matt. 
I wouldn't even know there's a 2nd game out or anything else without you. 
You're the ultimate promoter for it
Holy shitballs Matt can you PLEASE do a FILTHY FRANK THEORY
And with that, Matpat has lost my subscription.
I did not even hear about a new fnaf üò≤ wow
You'll get to milk it more and have to make a new timeline
Oh my God. I remember I was really surprised when matpat revealed he had a son, cause he always looked like 24 MAX to me. But not gonna lie he actually looks a bit older
another game...
Dude if they just throw out the thing then lives won‚Äôt be lost and why did they make 2 places if they know people can die there
Apologize to James Gunn
10:56 watch out there‚Äôs a cheap scare
scott: yeah fnaf 4 last game i swear, also scott: makes like 6 more games
Why do I feel like Scott and MatPat are working together lol..?
MatPat: This will be the last FNAF video.


Scott: O-Reeeeeaaaallllyyyyyy?
Matpat: Is FNaF finally done???

Scott: well yes but actually no
Matpat Existing

Scott: I‚Äôm bout‚Äô to end this mans whole career
Look on the FULL image on SCOTT‚ÄôS WEBSITE brighten up the image!!! Do you see FACES in the corners!?
MatPat: that‚Äôs it ive finally solved all the fnaf lore! 

Scott: ... makes new game

MatPat: 
Matpat: Stops making videos

Scott: QUICK ILL SAVE YOU!!!!
Matpat: I'm finally done with-
Scott: Lel.
MatPat : Finally I'm done with the timeline, the , books, and all the games!
Scott Cawthon : releases new game teaser
MatPat : NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Scott Cawthon :  takes down teaser
MatPat : yay...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ theory fodder
(When the timeline gets too complicated)
Scott Cawthon
Suffering from succes
yeah i can‚Äôt follow this video at all
you have to study like 24 hours worth of content to even have a sliver of understanding as to what‚Äôs going on
Matpat... remember when you said on film theory that announcing paid sponsorships at the end of a video can be potentially illegal?
What if the two technitions are Henry and William
"Remember Jeremy" more sounds like a threat
This poor man. This game will be the death of him, you poor poor soul.
You know he‚Äôs done with the series when he didn‚Äôt even add a special beginning.
I‚Äôm going to get nightmares nowüòÖ
9:50  SCOTT Voice crack
I have a theory: Fortnite Battle Royale and Save the world are both canon because the Cube. After the Storm King is defeated in save the world, all that‚Äôs left is the cube itself boiling in the water below. More on that later...
Matpat: Let‚Äôs get this over with
MatPat: We finally finished Fnaf!!!

Scott: Hold my pizza
Mat: This is my theory

Scott: Oh shoot gotta change the game he got it right.
MatPat's last fnaf vid: "It's all over now."
Scott: "Hold my beer."
Is it just me or does it look like funtime China is in the image he linked
Nice new editing style. It takes everything good about the old style and combines it with you seeming more personal since you're actually there doing stuff. Keep up the good work
MatPat, I think you over looked how the animatronics were melded together. I rewatched one of your previous videos(the full timeline one i think) and you theorized that William melded the original souls together to experiment and learn to harness immortality. So perhaps these tech people figured out, or maybe even saw, the true purpose of the machines. MAYBE, these people wanted to end it so they didn't end up in another case like Jeremy (side note i share Jeremy's last name so that's fun) and thus wanted to get out of it before anything else happened.  This is of course generalized because i can't seem to figure out why spring trap and funtime foxy are added to the mix, as if this theory can be added then it must mean that it is set earlier in the timeline. Maybe they play a bigger part in their story, or maybe i'm just wrong altogether with this(as i expect i am since you are a very thorough, and might i add very intellectual, being). Either way this may change nothing, as it fits pretty well with your theory, just was a thought while watching that previous video. Anyway, have a nice day, or night, and keep being amazing.




Edit: I was reading other comments for a while to see if anyone else had this idea(no luck) but i do want to point out that most of the comments follow these lines.


Matpat: thinks fnaf is over (in some sort of way, there were a lot of these comments this just generalizes them)


Scott: hold my 
Read it bottom to top and it will say 

Remember Jeremy
It was an accident
We let something inside
Don't listen to them
Scott: hey Mattpat nice to see you again how would you like a teaser for a new vr game, books, and a regular game that may or may not have super important lore that you have to spend the rest of 2019 and some breaking down happy Christmas
Mattpat: I just sat down
my mind jumped to "hey thats a face behind those bar things"
Did....did MatPat just reference Filthy Frank?
the intro: no no no no no no
people browsing youtube seeing this video:no no no no no no
7:56     Or it could signify a choice of trust in Faz Bear or the animatronic
Loving that office reference :)
that intro is a constant mood
I'm glad FNAF theories are back though. Always found them exceptionally entertaining.
Are you the odd one's out?
what happens if you have honey before this videos release? just a question
Put the horse back in its grave its already had a good beating
three words: phone guy death
I feel incomplete without hearing that "Hello Internet,welcome to game theory, the only show where etc."
Matt : Fnaf is done now

Scott : ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
MatPat: Finally, my final FNaF theory.

Scott: I ALWAYS COME BACK
Nice to see you can stand in ur closet
Okay so I noticed something,  it's about the hidden code in that one text file 0rgn. To me that spells out the word origin, it also explains that one photo of Enerd in the making. The technicians are letting Enerd in by building him, but why are they building him, why are they letting him in?
Scott: don't worry MatPat. I stopped making fnaf games. It's over.

MatPat: really? Is it really over?

Scott: yes, you can finally rest.

MatPat: YEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!

MatPat: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Poor matpat
Matpat: I‚Äôm finally done,,


Scott: Hold my broken animatronic
Matpat: I'm done

Scott: hold my vodka
Matpat : I am finally done 

Scott : hold my beer
0:06


Office reference?
Me in the first couple minutes of this video: fu- b-but I liked how it ended... It wassss good... :(
Vr though I am very disappointed üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I‚Äòm scared. That‚Äòll be interesting
Thank you Scott. Again you ruined my social life
See you on CoachTheWorld so that followers can talk to you ;)
I think Scott is just gonna keep making games until we figure out FNAF
God dammit Scott, how many times do I have to tell you
The puppet is at the side
Matt, take a nap
Wait does dis mean u making more fnaf musicals
Remember the candy kinet stories. The stories are about 5 things made into 1 and the teaser is 5 animatronics made into one. Also in one of the stories they let something in and the teaser says that the character of the game let someone in and made a mistake
Wait is this a new format with more matpat?
i was watching this at 11pm and i got the god damn annabelle 3 ad ffs
Scott:MatPat will never find this theory out!

MatPat:Am I a joke to you?
Edit: thanks for the likes lol
Fnaf related thing comes out:
-Matt: "god no, no please, no!"
-3,523,856 views
-Matt's bank balance: "god yes, yes please, yes!"
Wait...? H E douple toothpics? Reminds me of a spn quote
My question is if Scott even know the exact story of Fnaf.
Next thing you know Scott makes a Fnaf amusement park! Matpat: Scott!!!
Scott: what?! It‚Äôs what the fans want! Lol üòÇ
THEORY:
Shadow Freddy & Shadow Bonnie are the spirits of the workers we would be playing as in this upcoming game. That is why they appeared at the same time that Jeremy was working there. Idk I could be wrong. Just a thought.
15:04


Seems more like molten freddy.... Yet is still ennard so... nothing wrong here
10/10 best intro
15:37 DED XDDDDDDD Oh god. Poor MattPatt...
Nice, "the office" reference. Maybe it was an accident, but i hope it's a reference.
Hey mat do a video on dangonrompa
It's funny the trailer was released a week ago. And what d OK you know this video was released  a week ago
Matt: Phew! Finally done with all the FNAF theories! Now I can cover more games and get out the content that my viewers have been asking for.
Scott: LOL BET HERE‚ÄôS SOME STEAM STUFF YOU CAN OBSESS OVER. HAVE FUN LOSER
He's milked this cow so hard it has become fossilised.
Y‚Äôall what if fnaf 7 is just an April fools joke
I was thinking the lines are either the camera layout or the vents layout from FNAF 3
NOW!!
He‚Äôs crying right now
MatPat: Yes! Finaly i‚Äôm done with fnaf!

Scott: Well actualy...
epic
Matpat: ‚Äúokay, we‚Äôre done‚Äù
Scott: ‚ÄúHold my beer‚Äù
Matpat: sees teaser no
Also Matpat: ‚ÄúHold my beer‚Äù
Matpat and scott in a nutshell
Mat: 'creats channel'
Scott: I am going to create this guy's intire career
Matpat: Welp I'm done with fnaf
Scott Cawthon: I aLwAyS cOmE bAcK
(Also, the VR trailer is out, I guess Scott was really waiting Matpat to make a video XD)
Yes yes YES!! oh yes!!! Lololol
Scott: creates a new fnaf game


Matpat: oh poop...
Matpat: I have solved  FNAF 
Scott: hold all the FNAF I've made so far
I feel like that was a "The Office" reference at the beginning of the video üòÇ
Begins with an office reference tongue click noice
Five nights at Freddy's...

I haven't heard that name in years...
Theory to the pictures of the game: you, the technician will go fix the robots of every franchise, when youre about to leave one of the animatronics will start working and start cashing you until you get to a certain place, the animatronic will then shut down and you can leave, this will go on until sister location, you will have youre friend technician two with you every night but he will check the building not the animatronics wich means he leaves early. That was it for midnights theory.



Lol
Maybe the cover art has something to do with the Candy Cadett animatronic.
My lord hes back
there are new tesers
pls no psvr i dont have a ps4
how is this game still relevent
MatPat- I finally finished fnaf‚Äôs lore!!


Scott- CHUCKLES you‚Äôre in danger
Matpat : I finally have solved the FnaF Lore!!! I‚Äôm finally done whith This game!!

Scott : Hold my Movie
At This Point, Scott is only doing this to Drive MatPat Crazy
Fnaf 7: comes out
Matt: loses IQ points
This looks a lot better then I thought it would
thats FNaF 8 pictures dude
the lion sleeps tonight
This series can't die. Because How can you kill...

What isn't human
No, No, NO, NO GOD NOOO
Scott: Coming next the battle royale!

Matpat: humans where a mistake
0rgn? So Organ. As in "internal" as in "innards" as in the dude in the pic
You have to admit, a fnaf VR would is pretty cool
You were right about fnaf vr help wanted
I have the jacket of  toy Freddy lol twins
mattpat I have a question not relating to the video
and you might hate me if this question ends up making a new timeline
but I need to know

in one episode you said mangle was busies dog before susie possesed chicka 
but wouldn't mangle and chicka kinda have any friendly interaction of some sort?
because they knew each other before they died?
This forMAT is actually really cool
Mat I hope ur right about this.
I like the new format!
12:02 ‚ô•Ô∏è
Oooooh really cool new video format
please go back to the cupboard your not a weatherman
Hey I know this is a late comment but if you look at freddy on the trailer picture right above his eyebrow he has finger print markings, not sure this will lead you anywhere but here's some interesting evidence
I honestly can't tell the difference between the theories on FNAF anymore.
Me - sees video pop up "Oh, oh no..."
Matpat - "No, no...Oh god no!"
Me- "Exactly!"
Matpat: WE are finally done with FNAF


Scott:where is my computer!?...
MatPat : content noises
Scott : makes new game
MatPat : interal screaming
Matt, I gotta say, while I don‚Äôt necessarily care for your Fnaf videos, I do really like this new video style where you yourself show up more often on screen. It feels more genuine than the canned jokes that some of your other modern videos come with.
Da them is da demons
I like watching as MatPat slowly falls into insanity because of this game.
Matpat, I choose you! Use Series finisher!
1 damage, NOT EFFECTIVE

Scott, I choose you! Use FNAF 7
100 damage! SUPAH EFFECTIVE!
Everything is working as intended -Fazbear Entertainment.
Huh, i see Scott was inspired by Todd Hovard, it just works.
this isnt an april fools joke so advanced he made it march 24th to make it look more real? right? RIGHT?





Scott wont stop until we end him...
Everyone:ahh i've been finish the FNAF 
ScottCawthon:Mmm hmm are you sure about that
I have a feeling that Scott Cawthon keeps making FNAF sequels because of your constant accurate explanations for it XD
scott: another one, another one, another one, another one, another one,another one,


mat: NOOOOOOOOO
13:26 The very picture of toggle caps

HeCk
Scott: lets make another one.
mat pat: am I a joke to you?
This is the Best thing to ever happen In 2019
Matpat go back to your previous style of game theory. This you on camera so much is throwing me off.
I started laughing far too hard when he said lobe-lad. I don't know why that made me laugh.
oh my god was the beginning of that an office reffreance?
Did anyone else notice the three dots that are somewhat hand sized above Freddy‚Äôs left eyebrow?
The 10th final fnaf theory
YESSSSS
Game Theory: And that's just a theo-


Scott: HeReS tHiS aNd tHiS aNd tHiS aNd tHiS aNd...

Everyone: Oh, nice creepy teaser.


Matpat: LOOK AT THE NOSE
Scott: More FNAF!!!!

MatPat: Twitching and rocking back and forth in a white room.
When an indie game franchise is more consistent than your love life
I don't know if anyone else noticed, but i'm pretty sure Austin dropped a few subtle hints that he likes Mirage...
You were right dude! There is a video out called "Every Legend in Apex Legends Explained by Respawn" by Wired!
I miss crazy irritated Austin. This sentimental caring Austin is just... wrong...
Wraith is the most mysterious legend ever
Bloodhound: Am I a joke to you?!?!
Should have done how mirage's holograms work.
"hey Austin?"
"Yeah?"
"WHERE IS THE SEQUEL TO 'WHO IS THE RICHEST GAMING CHARACTER'?!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
Hi Austin I have a theory, you know wraiths ability to travel almost invisible and no one can damage her? Well maybe she is traveling in another parallel universe where there is no one there. Evidence 1: You cannot see teammates or enemies in this state. Evidence 2:  When she enters this state you can see shadows of other wraiths around you, like in this state she can see parallel wraiths. Just hope you look at this. Love your videos.
so wait ur saying that wraith never existed until the apex games
and this is why i'm a pathfinder main
also this is into the spiderverse all over again
Mat pat is trying to hid the secret about fnaf
Oh wow lol! The devs just confirmed in a WIRED video that wraith is communicating w/ different versions of herself from different dimensions. This was pretty spot on and its funny since I saw that video then this one
Why was a FNAF 7 video just put out and then immediately deleted
Austin, what is your opinion of the current state of Mirage Rule 34?

I assume you have all images downloaded, considering your crush on him.
I can imagine Austin coming home from a long day of work only to see his wife dressed up like mirage laying on the bed and everything Austin ever wanted coming true
MAT JUST UPLOADED A UNWATCHABLE FNAF VIDEO ITS TIME FOR A THEORY A MAT PAT THEORY AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
Austin: spents weeks trying to figure out Wraith's powers
Respawn & Wired: Releases a video explaining Wraith's powers one day before this video


Feels bad man.
I‚Äôve been in love with this game called ‚ÄúAlice: Madness Returns‚Äù I know there‚Äôs something hidden in that game but I can‚Äôt put my finger on it... A little help would be nice üëç
Someone else here before the FNAF 7 notification?

Before it got erased idk
Don't forget that you can see more Wraith outlines in portals and when she teleports!
There's a reality where she subscribed and smashed that like button
Austin : wraith is the strongest legend she can never lose
Also austin : loses every fight
Did you know that you can see other versions of wraith when you are using her ability
Now i want wraith to have a line where she says: el psy congroo
Well done on delting the fnaf vid
The most mysterious ,according to respawn, is Bloodhound
Wraith would be a great company. Yes JUST her I mean imagine it

Wraith 1: Ok so we are going to launch the new product.

Wraith 2: actually in the future you get sued if you keep the name

Wraith 3: Yea but if she switches the name then she gets hunted down

Wraith 4: Yea but if she gets hunted down and reads this then she will be killed

Wraith 507: yea but if she reads this then she will be fine

Wraith 2: wait what happens to wraith 5-506?

Wraith 507: they stopped reading after wraith 4

Wraith 4 but how could they read yours if you happened after them?

Wraith 507: I‚Äôm not sure

Wraith 2, 3, 4, and 507: ENEMIES NEARBY
My sister made a list of sentient characters
Sans
Flowey 
Wraith from Apex
Her void jump looks a lot like infinite warfare's FTL thing
just stop and enjoy the goddamn game :)






ps. this is a joke, love your videos :)
In summary life is just a gamble
don't give up
It predicts we‚Äôll have bad mic quality in the future?
Did you just do that so you could get more views on this video because you knew people would come here to ask what happened?

Nvm, I was wrong
do a plants vs zombies garden warfare 2 theory
If you dont think there is anything to theorise you are wrong
This may be lost. But theres a video by Wired where they talk about legends with Respawn. They say that when Wraith is in the void, all shadows are different versions of herself that entered and passed through the void at the same time she is.

Using this I would love to believe that the wraith you play when leaving the void is actually another wraith from what could possibly be from another player who also had the exact same stuff you did.
Did anyone else get the notification of a new fnaf theory:fnaf 7 the untold story of sister location?
How to calm Austin down:
Step 1: Buy a Mirage body pillow.
Step 2: Throw it at Austin.
Step 3: Throw more Mirage body pillows at Austin.
Repeat the process until Austin is calm.
Mirage is a Beaitiful Man. I love and play him everytime. And You should totally do more Apex related theories!!!!
It‚Äôs true


As soon as I hear the warning I just go into the phase ability to get away
This video told me nothing.
I totally understood everything that you saidüòÇüòÇ
0:27 Austin: GIVE ME A TIC TOK DEAL!
tic tok ad plays
Oof.
So, wraith is the next chosen undead? Kindling the fire through Apex?
So wraith is all powerful and eternal so yeah I know who I'm playing next
God I LOVE YOU! Damn it this helps my current level of depression and anxiety.
Should have just said wraith is like Okabe from steins gate, with the d mail and Steiner reading ability.
Austin: Asks for TikTok deal 
Me: How could you? We trusted you.
No one:
Austin: Wraith!
Austin, buddy? You okay? Need some time alone with Mirage and a box of tissues?

Heya, I‚Äôve had a question for a long time (not that long of a time but just throwing that in for dramatic effect) is Dr Zomboss from Plants vs Zombies actually human? I mean he has that big ol brain doesn‚Äôt he... right?

Is it weird that what you explained is pretty obvious to me? Like VERY similar to what I think of wraith's abilities before watching your video. (O.O  )

By the way, thanks for the hard work, it's a really nice theory video. (OwO  )
it would be amazing if those multiple worlds are data being mined and shared among every game being played as wraith.
can't explain something?

Logically it will only be at the moment of death and closest to the present version. That would use the least amount of energy, and account for the message.
Mal a video on how much energy a flintknock pistol produces
There are some QUIPS that Wraith has that proves this.
One is "In another life, this may have been different" and the other one is, "A little birdie told me all about you".
I don't know if the second one proves anything, but I think the first one does.

Dear austin

I know you've discovered Mario's gravity in 3D Mario games, but in the 2D games Mario falls at the same speed....
The dudes who designed the characters of Apex actually mentioned that when you phasewalk, you can see flashes of her from other timelines also phasewalking. Phasewalking is apparently a dimension between other dimensions and can see neaby dimensions, so other Wraiths are just phasing in and telling your Wraith what they see before they phase out.

Here's a link to the video: 
Ah,
I love words that I don‚Äôt understand but I still get some joy out of coupled with music.
Personally I think multiple timelines theory is... Just wrong. Everything always acts in the same way everytime, physically. Why wouldn't it be the same on a quantum level?
Austin: Researchs a topic for AGES
Respawn: Releases a guide for the topic
Austin: Am I A Joke To You?
Hey! Austin! It's me! Hey I'm totally curious and you're the man to ask. How much radiation is coming out of Firebreak's reactive core to kill somebody within seconds in CoD: BO4? Thanks! Love the videos!!
The multiple worlds thing on save games reminds me of a character from the book Worm(i think I'm spelling it right), where he can basically split himself across two parallel timelines/universes and he uses this ability to his advantage because he can basically choose both options in a one out of two options scenario. 

Don't know why I'm saying this but hey, it's cool
Man, who knew Sonic from One Punch Man was so powerful?
MatPat should do a video about Wraiths Origin. Like if u agree
The best advice for time travel comes from Cheif O'Brien of DS9. "Time travel? Don't."
It has been confirmed in a WIRED interview that wraith hears the voices of an infinite other wraiths from parallel dimensions.
6:41, Hang on, I'mma pause right here and explain, Schrodnirs Cat, I can't remember the name, is a Cat that's both dead and alive, as stated before I paused, it's a Cat in a box with poison, the Cat is dead but also alive, that's about as far as I can remember.


, Dude, that's saving and reloading, knowing the future in a sense, another way to explain is Marai Nikki.


, So, in short, it's creating multiple different worlds/universes/dimensions/etc.
I love string theory and parallel  universe theory vids!!! There‚Äôre so interesting and cool!!! Thnx Austin!

To be honest i like the visualizations of the older videos, now its hard to comprehend the information (the older videos had more detailed visualizations)
Roblox is still better.






Nah jk its minecraft.
The devs had said that those ghost-like figures when you're portal jumping is just her in a parallel universe.
Or maybe, you know, it's just voices from the void and They're just looking at the person aiming at her.
Nah, the strongest legend is Shroud
Hey Austin, I'm wondering, what would happen if you got crushed between 2 portals connected to each other?
Theres bean an update on the scottgames.com In the elements 'Remember Jeremy' it says can you explain it?

4:38 I think that it‚Äôs traveling though anther dimension because if a player use the same Ability you can see them moving though the dimension but aye that just a Theory.
nobody:




me: Where is the sequel!?
if i were to explain this, heres how i would.

when she teleports (or void jumps) you see faded characters, those are wraith, in multiple timelines, void jumping while they are too, essentially,  the voices in her head are herself, but they experienced it before they did, giving a warning so it wont happen again.

Her powers are explained in the WIRED interview called "Every Legend in Apex Legends Explained By Respawn | WIRED"
Great video! I'd like to put forward one idea about it however:

You mentioned near the end of the video that Wraith must be bombarded with loads of information and then kinda left it at that. To expand on this, it kind of makes me believe that she would "sense" this information rather than absorb it verbatim (so to speak). Similarly to the way the human eye sees loads of information but focuses on what the brain tells it to, Wraith could possibly have a general sense of the other Wraith's experiences which would allow her to focus on individual things that she needs to react to. What would cue her into any specific action would be a result of a higher amount of "you're in danger" cues that the other Wraiths would be experiencing. Kind of like how you don't pay much attention to things in your peripheral vision until you sense movement in it. Since there's so much info your senses provide, the human brain gets really good at seeking out the bits that are important to it and simply ignores the rest. 

Example: Wraith ends up in a spot where she has a sniper aiming at her head. There's little to no cover near by, so lets say 90% of the "many worlds" Wraiths who end up in this situation end up getting shot in the head. That would be something Wraith could pick up on since the spike of "you're in danger" cues from the many dying Wraiths would stand out from the miasma of information coming from the infinite versions of herself. Just like how you can look at a car and think in your head "wow that paint job is terrible" in actual English words, Wraith would sense this danger and be able to infer that "there's a sniper about to kill me" as her own voice absorbing said information.

Just a thought :)
Respawn confirmed this in a wired interview!!
Sir. I commend you for... 'tolerating' python... If you ever want to cross over to the side of JavaScript, were waiting.

Now correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Austin also forget that at any moment Wraith can jump, stop moving or slide with the ither combonations?

WHERES THE FNAF 7 VIDEO

WHY DID YOU DELETE YOUR VID!

(This is for mat pat not Austin)
But hey where is MarkASS BROWNIE??
Go watch Apex Wraithman Royale,It is the name of the video.

I cant tell the number of wraith they kill in it
Her design reminds me Sonic from One-punch Man...

It's a video game you're taking it too far ü§£
MatPat, PLEASE do a Spyro the Dragon theory!!!
Hey please do a video about where sonic actually stores his rings can you explain this mystery
Yes! Finally an Apex Legends theory!

Also i thought about it while watching this video, but Mat should do a Diet Theory on how many chemical warfare laws Caustic breaks throughout the game.
Literally one tapped a wraith with the 50cal today
If you think about it this is really heavy, Wraith just constantly hears herself dying from parallel universes but at least it helps her survive.
7:20 Schr√∂dinger isn't Dutch, he's Austrian. The German version would be Verdammt
This is fascinating and all, this is what her power is and makes sense üòÉ but then you realize that it‚Äôs just the code in the game that makes it so that she says ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs aiming at you‚Äù when ever someone aims at a certain ‚Äúhitbox‚Äù around wraith :,) aah science
Why play Apex Legends when you can play Tetris 99
Hey Austin,next could you what's in octane seed formula
Good finally someone apreciating my main!
Get angry and opset Austin, yell at me; YELL AT ME!! [BATMAN's VOICE]
Or you could have just watched wired‚Äôs interview with game devs who literally explained everything he talked about when describing wraith
In titan fall2 there's a character in the multiplayer where it's a robot pilot and has the same phasing ability as Wraith, so what if IMC wanted to make a human version of that but since it's a human they had to brainwash/kidnap them to test on them and stuff. I say "them" because we don't know if wraith was the only person tested on, it would be cool if we had another person show up with seemingly magic powers like wraith, and the fan base connected them two to have been from IMC.
I have to say I haven't seen much Apex Legends gameplays lately, so I don't really know what you are talking about, but it's still quite interesting! üòÅüëç

But, yeah, I love Multiverse Theory and today I learned a lot more about it :3
Missed this guy <3 never played Apex and probably won't BUT TELL ME ABOUT THAT SCIENCE THOOOOO
Funny enough in a WIRED interview with some of the people working on the game, they said themselves that the voices are in fact alternate universe versions of wraith giving advice. They also mentioned thats why you see other Wraiths when you void run.
Dear Austin, 

You made a small mistake; "Verdorie" is not something commonly said in Austria (as they speak primarily German and not Dutch in which "verdorie" and "potverdorie" are correct).

The correct German translation sounds much more omnious, namely; "verdammt noch mal"
doesent wraith use the phaseshift from the titanfall games
Hahahahah dead game
Watches video..




Able to teleport and fall in da void
16:00 unless you get killed in irl

That pretty insurmountable
Regardless of whether we (the individual) know if we know the cat is dead or alive, it is one or the other.  The person just doesnt know.  Perspective is different than reality.
If they make a tshirt "Hi! It's Me! Austin!" With his big face on it I'll definitely buy it. Why they still didn't make this yet? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This reminds me of the nonary games (specifically 999)
I'm not gay or anything, but I could fit a couple mirages in a few places.
Hey Austin, your theory's been confirmed by the crew in WIRED's video on Apex! :) Good job!
Matpat I saw you on the YouTubers reacting to no nut November video it's hilarious and I start fangirling as soon as I saw it
Does this imply that every time you get an item in mariokart, then there will be a new universe created for every other possible item?
oN hYpe tRAin?







I mean you guys never did a theory on TitanFall where the phasing guys and gals are robots so no one would die from dimension travelling.
5 minutes in..when does he say why you cannot lose scientifically?
austin and mirage




i ship it
tldr: austin exlains a thing that the devs said themselves; Wraith is being warned by herself from another dimension.
Damn it I love this episode but Austin didnt get frustrated
'Tis only spooky science, nothing of worry.
Wow austin you just made an video that might be true, congratulatuons... i whould have said if not pretty much anyone with an brain could understand!

Come up with something that isen't more obiously than bangaloure being an pun on bang-Galoure!

Devs explained the voices already. Go watch them talk about it on Wired
Wow, when I saw the thumbnail for this, it said only 4 minutes since uploading. I'm usually not that early! Also, disappointed this isn't a continuation of the "Who's the richest character in all of gaming" series.
I might comment more on this after I've watched the whole video.
this is the basses of how i thing the Mandela Effect works. if an object goes back in time suddenly new realities r created pushing up against the old 1s. and do to the energetic chaos some people and objects r quontom copy living in a new time line that dosent 100% fit there memory. like a PC program finding itself  in a Mac.
If apex legends was realistic:
Wrath:Infinite worlds eh? Isn‚Äôt there a world where i do found out who i am? Couldn‚Äôt one of me just tell me?
I can read 3 things from between your lines:
1. The other worlds you speak of are other currently running Battle Royale matches, where someone currently dies for that message.
2. Each timeline represents one Battle Royale match.
3. It would make more sense, when the whole Battle Royale thing is happening as a separate story, not applying as a continuation of the main story of hers.
There was video with the devs that basically confirmed your theory
7:21 Has schr√∂dinger ever even been to the netherlands? Because verdorie is dutch and I haven‚Äôt been able to find any information about him speaking dutch
This might sound weird or insulting but I really don't understand why people would want to know more about parallel universe or other world's when we clearly can't deal with this existing world/universe alone

I knew right was the correct choice in lifeüòâ
THE SCIENCE OF... why Mirage is so damn handsome
If Wraith is so strong how come I always end up losing?
I hate to break it to you, but what you call "LOVE" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marrage. Break the cycle.  Rise above and focus on anime titties
YAY POSITIVITY!!!
This video makes me feel good about losing with wraith
jeez, i was expecting a lot of numbers as soon as i seen "SCIENCE" in my notifications, and instead, i got a new look on life, and a pep talk

not what i was expecting but kewl, good with me
And another piece of evidence. If u use the into the void ability you can see others wraiths
HAY AUSTIN GOOD JOB! YOU MADE MY MIND MELT!
I cannot BEGIN to describe how good it feels to have someone who I respect and look up to be so open and unabashed about their orientation. From all the bisexuals I know and love, thank you Austin :). Even when it‚Äôs in a goodie joke it still feels like such great validation
Canot lose until ali a or jake paul plays as her.
Wait... Teleporting Demon with amnesia? She's like a Psychic Shadow the Hedgehog

Why is that the first place my mind went?

Also austin : No
The bits about Mirage got me real good, great job Austin

This is one of the few vids that I watched Austin not screaming when he did get something wrong.
So I'm violently depressed, but for some reason as morbid as the thought of hearing yourself constantly die just so that you can succeed...eventually is, this lifted my spirits. Weird.....
Austin, that video was strangely optimistic. Okay who are you and who put you in Austin‚Äôs clothes!

bUT PatHfiNDeR IS bESt chARacTER
The simple answer is she‚Äôs an alternative universe version of spider-man. LETS GO WRAITH FOR SPIDER VERSE 2
This is a theory I wanted to ask for a long time but could not due to almost nobody knowing what Titanfall 1 and 2. Could a titan really fall? Would a titan land like we see in the games, I was afraid to ask this because respawns games were pretty much unknown till Apex
Hey Austin your theory was confirmed by Respwan 2 days before this video in fact lol. They had wraith watching you
man, those glasses remind me of Tootie from Oddparents
dude i've never actually played apex legends before but i was talking with a friend who plays and he described all the characters to me, and i thought i would like to be wraith cuz he sounded overpowered. lol i was right
15:57 he traded a wingman for a re-45 
utter blasphemy
Hearing about this wraith character along with your explanation of her ability makes her amnesia make perfect sense.
She's constantly suffering from an information overload that her brain can't handle and thus it's deleting extraneous information for the purpose of expanding her survival capabilities.
This is why she maintains memories regarding the scope and operation of her powers and combat skills but loses the vast majority of her interpersonal and social skills.
Hell, the repetition of the same few pieces of dialogue can also be explained with this, she's forgotten all of the different ways she could word a phrase in exchange for keeping an efficient and quick phrase that accurately communicates her point.
It almost sounds like a JJBA Stand Power
This is a semesters worth of math for me thank you
You got it correct, they confirmed this in a wired video including developers of Apex Legends.
I think he want them Mirage body pillows Uwu
Did I just catch a Bloodborne reference?
Are you also gonna talk about taking a sniper shot through the head and getting picked up like nothing?????
Austin, you should play titanfall 2. It's a great game with amazing movement mechanics, even better than apex. You'll have a lot of fun calling in your first titan too...
Hey wtf guys, I just saw that pop up for a fnaf video. You can‚Äôt just act like it never happened I saw it

Seems about right.
I was literally thinking of this video like 3 weeks in advance
Hey, so heres the thing.
If this theory was true, wouldnt there be a world where we invent the ability to dimension hop, and out of all the worlds, it goes to ours and kills everyone with every way possible at every tick wearing every thing ect
I'm a big fan of the Schrodinger's cat thing but I'm an even bigger fan of Schrodinger's goomba
Miss these videos Austin wish you'd upload this more frequently!!!
You have to add the position, etc. of the other players as well
dude u should meet a gorgeous stranger named byakuran!!!
5:05 help please I need that awesome song -
I didn't make this comment.
But I also did make this comment.
Isn‚Äôt this basically how jedi work
Honestly the best part of this channel, missed you Austin.
Hey MatPat try to make a theory about simulacra (pretty sure this is going to fun one)
God Firefly references still hurt my soul
Why mirage, you should have chosen garaltar!
1:18
That ain't Minecraft or Fortnite Austin.
Do you have a list of the music you used in this video? I think its awesome!
What happened to the fnaf 7 video?
I like the many worlds theory. It gives me hope that there are an incalculable of me's that are doing something great with their lives. Yeah, it means there are an incalculable number of me's that are much worse off than me, but I like to think positive. 

I would love to get power like Wraith. You know, have all me's out there team up and achieve something on the main timeline(if there is one).
dirty-deeds-done-at-a-reasonable-price
actually this could also explain why there more than 1 of the same character in a match
This is a great video for self confidence
You know hat scares me...





In a different timeline Austin didn't make this video
Self-confidence < Austin saying he is rooting for me
Alright now we got to find out who marvs cough cough I mean pathfinders owner is
(Really I really want to see this poor mrvn hasn‚Äôt seen his owner in so long)
I just watched 5 hours of this channel
I actualy realy enjoyed the music in this video
I'm a wraith main so yes I'mma insta like an watch this
Click bait i always lose 0/10
First theory from you, hope it is going to be good.
How come most/all enemies in this video were just the legend name + a number?
Torment: Tides of Numenera had a similar character named Callistege.  She had connected herself to her "sisters" in alternate universes.
Hey Austin,
Can you do an episode on how octane is taking so much 'adrenaline' per match, and is not dead.
what is that music playing in the background while hes talking about the many choices she can take at about 8:09?
really want to know.
This video got strangely optimistic at the end, After all the Austin screaming and stuff, and then hit with the "you got this"'s, it's nice.
How tf do u use python like that , all i know is the print command and variables
I just realized this. Wrath is like Zelretch, and uses the Operation Of Parallel Worlds! This makes it so much better! Fate stay/night for the WIN!!!
please, please, please do a titanfall theory of some kind
This dude has some weird stuff going on
Hi! It's me, a theorist!
I'm here for the gameplay.
Next game theory will prove wether or not Austin is gay
I hate the apex legends loading screen GOD DAMN
Jack I mean Billy eilish I mean wraith
I‚Äôve never played this game before, but once I heard about this character who gets help from herself in a different timeline, the only thing I could think of was ZERO ESCAPE! They even use the many worlds theory to explain it!
I MAIN WRAITH !!
Maybe do something on how big the knight is from Hollow Knight
Tbh I don‚Äôt watch game theory anymore, but I still stay subscribed for Austin
Hey Austin, 
I didn't expect this inspirational ending. But I am currently applying for Graduate schools, jobs, internships, and whatever else happens after college. I have trouble sometimes getting discouraged by the INSANE amount of rejection that comes with applications. But this video on Apex legends really got to me. Despite all the crap that comes my way, inevitably, it will be for the best. I enjoyed this video very much. I know that you get flooded with comments, but I hope you get to see this one. Just know that your work isn't in vain; you're doing good things.


Sincerely,








Lyman
Can you make a video about every legend
They literally told us that the voices are hers from other dimensions
You made a lot of Sans references there
I was unaware of the term "superposition" and this video made the song "Superposition" by "Young the giant", so much better
7:21 : that is Dutch! Did you just search 'Dutch swear word'?
THE        V O I D
i just saw the toby fox dog
How does bloodhounds science work
Hey bud. Wired already did an interview with respawn entertainment. And they have already said that wraiths "psychic" prediction's is just other versions of herself from various other dimensions giving her a warning
So if I play as wraith I always win somewhere that makes me feel better about my nonexistent career
Hey Austin, would you please tell matpat that the Freadbear archives DO exist.
And now you know how I got good at video games. XD
This does NOT sound like our beloved Matt Patt
Wraith is part of a team? That's unfair! Every other legend is in a team of a maximum of 3, while wraith is literally infinite enemies vs you
who watches austin because of the catchy opera music backround
MARIOPLEX FLASHBACKS
Dont blame respawn its ea's fault
tl;dr
TMI caused her amnesia. literally.
Gibraltar is best thicc
God bless love you alllll ^w^
15:24 it literally says "WRAITH: their in your sights"
Pshhh mirage caustic makes my man bits melt üòÇ
STOP!
THATS GAY
Anyone else get a fnaf video notification about fnaf 7 and the video just wasn't there?
Since you seem to be really great at game theory, can you cover Beyond You?
3:05 Its thrity.

But good guess ^.^
Different worlds theory? 
...
Oh, so I'm watching a Steins;Gate video now.
Look I understand you put science behind it but if you played titanfall 2 it's pretty much time traveling
like when i looked to the left and hit a pot hole and fractured my jaw and broke a couple teeth... in another universe i didn't good to know
what's the music during the intro? at 0:26
I still dont understand the gumba even if it was simplified
Tesla was right about scientists delving miles into theory and away from reality.
Wraith my jam, already I like the video lol
14:09....this is self explanatory.
I'm probably the only one here who knows what "verdorie" means
just so you know fnaf isn't over IT "ALWAYS COMES BACK"
Why delete fnaf vid
I have not watched game theory in 3 years who Austin
Just asking, who do you prefer Austin or matpat.
God I love quantum mechanics.
I believe that the consequences of being able to know the position of EVERY SINGLE MOLECULE in a given space is known as Laplace's demon
Any one see him trade a wing man for a RE-45  15:55
Thought this was Matpat still, great theory Austin
Im so happy to hear the words dear respawn entertainment
I always saw go to the future not as actually traveling through time, but as traveling to a dimension where the time you want to go to, is that time
That last little bit was really needed today. Thank  you. And then I saw mirage and coudnt stop laughing
Watch out for the memetic kill agent at 7:30
That intro is perfection.
hey Austin I will make this short wraith travels to the 4th deminsion or another existince and comes back to the third deminsion our plan of existince there solved in one comment
Midway through the video and I can only think: "Okay. She is Carlos from Zero Time Dilemma, basically."

Any Zero Escape fans here? D=
make how ashe (over watch) coach gun work
0:32 HELLO!!!!!!!! :D
14:00 so... a divergence meter prototype?
Dear Austin
  Can you leave matpat do the voice over in videos thanks
Oh and austin you can see other wraiths when going in a portal or using her ability so yeah other wraiths in a pocket dimension
now youre thinking with portals.
this is assuming every wraith has the same power as this wraith
Pls Explain DISC11 AND DISC13 from Minecraft
So the plot of the game is that in the year 2291, in an effort to control violence among deep space miners, the DEEP SPACE mining company, in coordination with the new Earth government, legalized no-holds-barred fighting?
Ôº©ÔºÆÔºÆÔºØÔº∂Ôº°Ôº¥Ôº©Ôº∂Ôº•.
Did he drop a Wingman for an RE-45? What universe is he playing in?
Knowing that if wraith dies she can still help herself live... It fills you with Determination.
How do you turn off Helsey's ad?







Xd
Listen Austin tell mat that he needs to make a game theory about titanfall 2
oooo I know the answer... Her hitbox
Austin. You. Like. Mirage?
We need an apex is just a simulation theory
WARNING!! Memetic kill agent located at 7:31.
The many-worlds thing is awesome! 
Also, what the heck was the ending?
I have been thinking about the many worlds theory recently just didn't know what it was called. Every variable ever has its own universes.
I just thought of this
Sunset overdrive: is the player human
The player in sunset overdrive can do things normal humans can‚Äôt do.
The player impossibly runs on walls, can take many shots before dying, when they do die they come back sometimes from a grave or tomb, and player can skid on water just to name a few. What do you think ü§î
Wraith is dr.strange!
What about gameplay wise
Where is all of your precious yelling?!?!
So basically she's Nezumi from Juni Taisen!
Shes using izanagi, the forbidden visual genjutsu
Spider senses NAH 
Telepathic voices
the gameplay is bad no offense Austin

How about making a game theory about Warframe? like "What does it take to create  a warframe" I mean you are a bit game channel and im kinda surprised you hadnt covered Warframe yet

like this if you want to see a Warframe game theory
Hey, that "tick of the universe" thing sounds interesting. I thought it wasn't discrete. Where can I find more about it?
In a interview the creator s of spex said when she goes into "the void" ( her tactical ability) there are  many different wraiths from different universes and she hears it from the void. So you have it confirmed folks.
The moment you know Erwin Sch√∂dinger is from Austria where they speak German and like most American made shows he speaks Dutch (at 7:21). German and Dutch are not the same! Gosh darnit


If he said verdammt instead of verdorie I would have been okay with it.
So, Wraith is Laplace's Demon?
verdorie is dutch not german. schrodinger spoke german
Damn austin i like your work i wish i could do this üòÖ
What happened the new video
weres matpat??
You're very close. In a video on wired the devs for apex said when you enter the void for your passive, you can see other wraiths there if u look close enough. The devs said the void is like a way to see  other universes. They said when one wraith in it sees that another wraith is being aimed at, they tell them. So u were very close
Hmm what sweater should I wear there are infinite options
How could I "got this" if I have never watched this video?
Hey austin, Why can't the many worlds hypothesis be how time travel works, with time travelers being stable boltzman brains, but the whole body, with memories.
I know most of the answers in the vid since I know what wraith‚Äôs ability it is phase shift from titanfall 2 and they are traveling to a different dimension called the upside down where they kinda escape for a couple seconds and comes back to the real world
This episode of THE SCIENCE: exists
Me: warm fuzzies
So a wraith from similar dimension that went through what were doing is helping us/wraith
Austin confirmed big gay for mirage
You should make t-shirts that say "Hi, it's me... Autism!"
Scream into matpats ear until he dose a titanfall it apex video
Austin x Mirage OTP xD
Watch the end of the 2nd season
Wraiths other personalities wouldn't be telling her to run this way or jump they would only be telling her to turn around because someone's aiming at her
Sooo... wraith best girl?
Matpat! Can you pleass try to make a theory on Beyond you? üòä
If the multiple worlds theory is true. And it doesn‚Äôt effect one person. And there is infinite universe, and they can repeat. That means if I can travel to any  universe I feel like. I could go to one where I can talk to a super magical meme doge god.
Compared to the usual end of your videos... this one was a very positive and uplifting one. I liked!
im pretty sure that i learned the many worlds theory from a anime
You wanna schooler ship
The infographics show... or idk¬ø
Man I love this game
Y u do dis Matpat
What is that background music.?
On Wired's video where the developers of Apex Legends explain all their existing characters, they did prove that the voices she hears are actually different versions of her and  those random static figures she sees when she phases are different possibilities of her movement.
Hey u should do Warframe lore it has a big community and some lengthy but interesting lore
I know about the many worlds theory it‚Äôs so cool
So he's a mirage main?
But doesn't everyone have the gay for Mirage
i enjoyed the video,
my left ear did not.
wait wrong comment.
The science of... anas sleep dart (overwatch)
When I first looked at the thumbnail I thought it was sonic from one punch man.
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap!
So via the logic of the story that a game such as this doesn't have but is cannon there will not be a titan fall 3 in a date after when Apex takes place
Austin..
I love theorys featuring you as the host. I'm not gay. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE THEORYS WITH YOU IN. With great wishes Alva Tobias B.
So... where did the fnaf vid go
People underestimate "infinite".
Wraith doesn't travle back in time, she just teleports to another dimension, the void
THE DEVS CONFIRMED THIS ALREADY
Well, Respawn told how her abilities work in the recent video they did with Wired.
Can‚Äôt explain how it works exactly just watch the video, but basically it‚Äôs what Austin said in this video. Also at 8:14 you can see a shadowy Wraith on the right side, suggesting even more there are multiple versions of her in the ‚Äúvoid‚Äù
Would it be possible for all wraith's possibilities die at once and she won't be alive in any timeline(inevitable death basically) or somehow someway, any one of them, if not many, is always guaranteed to survive?
but every match is different with different players to kill so different actions and results from them so what is the point to tell another player that they got killed by a Pathfinder if maybe a Pathfinder is not even in another Wraith's map that is still alive.
Its like a shadow clone jutsu
Damn hitbox, it's too OP.
Advanced physics exam tomorrow?


F‚Ç∫&' that new Austins video.
Looks like Austin took my recommendation for Mat.
lifeline is the true psychopath
ITS CALLED QUANTUM PHYSICS DUMMY
uhh... I Lost Playing Wraith Once...
wraith is Garnet from steven universe without any memories
Wraith = Raven
have matpat played scp containtment breach?
Do you put quantum in front of almost everything
You know this is correct!!! If you jump into the void (tactical move) you can see wraith running if you look hard enough where she is running left right..nerdy boo yaüñê
Please make a game theory on Freelancer
Am I the only one who thinks Wraith looks like Sonic from OPM?
Wait




Austin‚Äôs Gay?
I got an epic games ad while watching an apex legends video
Why does she kinda remind me of Fetch from Infamous SecondSon?
end: *nooting intensifies*
6:26 I am reading a book called The Rise and Fall of DODO (not the bird) about magic and this thought experiment.
BANGALORE IS BETTER THAN EVERY OTHER LEGEND
Can u do o theory on how strong is donkey Kong
Go to the the channel wired and there is a video of apex that explains all the characters and it explains wraith so this guy waisted his time
Did I hear a firefly reference?
She's Lilith from borderlands
someone please tell me WHAT THE HECK IS THE POINT OF APEX LEGENDS LIKE THE BACKSTORY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED THAN PUBG AND FORTNITE
I‚Äôm probably the only that misses when he was more coffee addicted and screamed a lot in his videos. 






I don‚Äôt need a chilled theorist we have Matt for that
Star Trek: Nemesis, what are thalaron particles and would they be dangerous?
When is the next Kirby is evil video?!
This made me feel so small
As soon as I clicked on the video and saw Google drive, I knew I was in for one of the best videos of my life.
R u gay nothing wrong with that just news to me
Is Austin bi? Seems like it so you do you dude, I ain‚Äôt gonna judge ya
I'm not sure how your suggestion system works but heres my question since you tackled the science of stimpacks and stuff what about the science of eating food in video games?
i like screamy Austin better :(
what was the music used also great video
#miragegang
it's like a book i read about 2 weeks ago leonardo patrignani's multiversum where 2 teens can telepathically connect and talk with eachother and they discover they are in a parallel world but they can control theirselves in the parallel worlds.
Austin ya metion how hot you think guys are more than i do, which is alarming
Next TIMEEE FIND BETTER GAME PLAYYYY
Please do one on yandere sim pls
hey not going to lie the music was on point this video.
WHY!!!! Plz don‚Äôt do this to my favorite games plz
Did Austin change the thumbnail?
Stop making me question my reality dammit
the thumbnail has changed twice. im afraid.
What is the other game that was at the time 5:05
How did a episode of game theory turn into a self esteem boost?
Austin
is an anagram for
Autisn
Lol looks like Sonic from One Punch man
At 6:02 he says it‚Äôs the Quantum Superposition Principle, but it‚Äôs actually the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
She looks like Sonic from 'One Punch Man'.
Looks like someone read Qualia the Purple XD.

If you liked wraith concept, there is a manga (called qualia the purple) where, without spoiling to much, there is a full story based on this quantom many word concept and the possibility of sharing information between them.
It is also a good introduction to quantum theory according to my professors XD.
My brain hurts and I feel small now
GUYS THE FNAF VID IS BACK
Hey austin, might I add that when u teleport with wraith u can actually see other versions if herself going in different areas making different possibilities
It's just King Crimson's Epitaph ability, so to speak.



Waga King Crimson na noryuku is to predicto za future.
But to be honest, this feels more like d4c's ability.
Soooooo
Does that mean that I die every real life time unit in a different world constantly? That explains why I suck!
Is that Billie eilish
if apex let people choose their own class and have same classes in 1 team pretty sure half the field would be wraith's
Wonderful  video! Good work! üòÅ
lol I die with Wraith every time
I fell asleep but the video was over when I woke up. At least you got the watch time lol
GAME THEROY PLEASE DO A THEROY ON GRANNY
Hey u need to do a theory on monster Incs scream power theory if u haven‚Äôt already everyone like if u want to see this
Good job on this one Austin, but I have another challenge for you. Should be pretty easy since you've done things similar before. I was wanting to know how much force is behind Pathfinders grappling hook. You see him connect to rock, concrete, and even what I assume are thick metal walls. It should be pretty simple, hope to see something said about it :).
Waveform collapse is an outdated interpretation. The reason we can't predict the motion of a particle in spacetime is because it behaves sort of like one of those double pendulum things, except way more complex, and therefore way more chaotic and unpredictable. But what we can do is use math to predict the chance of detecting it at a certain point in spacetime, and then check that experimentally. That's what places like CERN have been doing for decades. The math that models particle behavior is The Standard Model. You may have heard there are issues with this still, and that is correct, to an extent. If you want a good, easy to understand explanation, I recommend watching a few Sean Carroll lectures.
What's the track that plays under Austin at 13:09?
Dear Austin and matpat please keep original thumbnails for your videos most look great
Tell mat pat fnaf help wanted has teasers so tell me Austin thought he might want to know
The developers explained this like almost a week ago, why are you stealing from them?
Wow i really got here early (*insert funny combat)
Didnt they explain this in a Wired video on youtube
Wraith also says "I've seen it all. Nothing surprises me."
"All you need is kill", anyone?
its just video game chill
Hey agario was the first battle royal
So she's Nicholas Cage in the film "Next."
now hang on, you didnt bring up the wierd figures that show up during her dimension shift ability, although i believe those are very similar to her voices as to why they are there im surprised you didnt mention them.
Some one in a different universe made a really bad. Game theory video
ƒ∞ realy want multi universe theory to be real.
Imagine that you will succeed everything and never die.
Fnaf VR teasers have been coming out
what is the bgm called
She‚Äôs my favorite character because she Natuto-Runs in public, without shame.
can someone explain to me the science behind those blue shining shield??
I haven't watched the video, but the answer is that wraith hears a voice from the void, which is from people in the void, and they tell her when there is danger.
my head hurts from this video
Apex legends is the next level to the Hunger Games
Hey Austin you should do a episode on what captain marvel‚Äôs photon beams actually are because in the movie they have recoil and I thought that photons didn‚Äôt have mass
Hey, Austin! I know you probably won't see this, but there is a fran- chise called Bloons tower defense and I absolutely love the games that ninja kiwi makes. I was wondering, if you want like more ideas, if you could make a couple on Bloons TD Battles? Maybe on BTD 5/6.  I don't know, but I just wanted to ask.
Mirage mine back off Austin üòÇ
When you go into phase you see other wraiths with you.
Now, if only you can tell me... HOW IN THE HELL DOES APEX LEGEND'S RESPAWN BEACONS WORK.
Watch the wired video they confirm this
You should do a titanfall theory
Wraith = Byakuran
I'm not touching that game.
It's made by a EA owned studio, for EA's Origin platform, it's got loot boxes we all hate EA for among other things, and it's made using the outdated Source engine, which is 15 years old by now.
Also, there is the chance that Respawn may get shut down by EA, like they did with other studios.
The only redeeming qualities has to be the game is free, but Fortnite and PUBG Mobile are both also free. (PUBG on other platforms are more crap and cost money.)
To backup about your theory on how wraith uses alt universe and herself if u use her Q ability it shows for a brief amount of time of other wraiths infront of her plus she might say "Void Jumping" meaning she is go into the void
Matpad meaby you can make a video how de odm gear works vrom attack on titan
Hey then I have a question are we the main universe in the other worlds theory or a copy
She‚Äôs Funny Valentine but on Drugs
make a thery on pacify plz
Don't even like Apex, Watched for the Austin.
The future is now thanks to science! Clemontic gear on
Hey its him!...Austin!!
Bloodhounds the best because he has a thermal vision and he can detect anything
She is just a pilot, nuff said
I'm rooting for you too buddy!
Can I get the songs used in the video, please? :)
Especially the song from 13:08, that's the most important!
Wraith used the concept of the device in Titan Fall 2 that allows you to move in between dimensions to move from one place to another in seemingly seconds as portrayed when you teleport in Titan Fall 2s campaign in the broken science facility they ask where he went and report to command that he seems to be teleporting but they are actually moving in the dimension in-between dimensions I forgot what the place is called. sincerely: Blake Wilson
At 0:38 I say about that "that's gay"
Not your best video to be honest
2:25 - 2:38 Well....
ur to loud
is this not matpat's channel? or did u just find his camera/computor
Woah woah I got a notification for a new FNAF video like a couple seconds ago, anyone else??
Zero escape.
were you payed a million dollars to make this episode
I miss Austin, why aren't you uploading regularly! I really hope you get back to shoddycast, because i rarely watch this channel since it's all about mario and fnaf
What noob did you get this game play from ?
Octane laughing in the distance***
What game is that @ 5:06 ?
Please stop the same song in ur vids i would enjoy them much more without it please
she can pick a timeline? why does she always pick the timeline where I lose when I play her?
Mirage = deadpool + clones.
Naw I smash wraiths like king kong
Now do the Physics of Jehuty from Zone Of the Enders.
How big is wraiths speedboost
Please, I am begging for a Sally Face theory.
Wired just posted a video with respawn talking about wraith and how she predicts the future
Are the Legends actually in a fight for their lives or are they just holograms in the titan fall universe?  Similar to the first episode of Love, Death and Robots..they are just hologram fighters digitally/mentally controlled by real people.  Also, if they are actually physically real characters, I think that the robotic characters are not fair since their death is not as utterly final, unless they are truly sentient I guess....I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about.  Rambles.
And I thought she was just a Weeb...
Could you guys do a HOI4  theory
0:04 Austins theme music!
So does this mean God is a superposition cause you don't know that's his there or not till you die(in other word till you open the box)
Who wants to hear a joke?

"Why was Apex Legends crying on the first week of its release?"
Sucks that the developers have already did a video about this but good video anyway
Can u do o theory on how strong is donkey kong
10 tredecilion but I may be wrong at 12:50
So the Goomba thing is kind of like Warframes relics.
You are the best matpat
That will help me travel back in timeüòé
I got a theory! what of ash is PKMN trainer yellow?
I agree with every single sentence he said except that he said the voice is crackly because she‚Äôs talking through dimensions since she can literally hop between them so easy I doubt she‚Äôs having trouble talking between dimensions. But like he said there are millions of versions of wraith going through the semi same instance. There are probably several thousand wraiths talking to her at once which is why it‚Äôs crackly. I know it literally doesn‚Äôt matter at all why the voice is crackly but I wanted to get my two cents in
I think Austin likes Mirage, guys.
I thought apex legends was gay
12:47 nice planck second you referenced there
I'm sure you had no trouble putting together a compilation of deaths.
what is the song in the background that starts at 13:08 ?
Loved this video
AUSTIN, PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF ADVENTURE CAPITALIST
I was the blue text and litarlly screamed in happiest
Plot twist, She‚Äôs actually Sonico
I like the Many Worlds interpretation.  But it's still just a fun idea that's probably not accurate to reality.  I have to filter my acceptance of these models through what's already been established.  Namely the First Law of Thermodynamics.  Where is all this energy and matter coming from?  Until someone provides evidence that the laws of thermodynamics aren't actually accurate... using the Many Worlds interpretation for theories is like assuming that time travel and travelling faster than the speed of light are already a thing that could happen.
El sai kongru
All of this reminds me of Doctor Strange‚Äôs powers
parallel universe wraith gets shot "your being aimed at"... by the many worlds theory the parallel would not exist until shes shot... so hows that work? she can travel universes AND time? you had a nice compelling argument going until you said that tbh
So basically this is just zero escape
austin: the many worlds theory
me: ahhhh. austin. why. (‚âß‚àÄ‚â¶)√óNO
Probably heard this one already but try and explain the drugs of octanne or his state of body from the drugs
I HEAR A MOLDAU
Why is shoddycast now game theory
So do we live in a non quantifiable universe or not?
Lost way too many brain cells imma dc
this might be true coz we can also watch the other wraiths while she fazes
all wraith mains are connected, Dizzy is the wraithest wraith and therefore the undefeated wraith with the help of wraith mains.
If we talking magical woman characters in videogames, how about sirens from the borderlands games? Take your pick at their powers, there is 6(in lore) of them and all are different.

Though maybe wait for borderlands 3 to come out and see the other two new sirens as well before nerding your brains out about them.
Theres just a problem dude :v , the science of wraith is not only in Apex , IN TITANFALL , THE "ARC" , THE ROBOT'S THAT I DON'T REMENBER THE NAME , but they are like a wraith but a robot , I think the science is in the quantic weapon , like BT , the titan from titanfall2 he saved a planet trowhing herself into the arc and he just simple POOFFFF , he don't explode , he just *delete BT * and he lost into the time (It's my theory)
Whos this new guy
H A O W
10 tredecillion times per second
Who says you cant learn anything from games
why tf did i watch the last 20s with all my mind
the intro hits me to close to heart not gonna lie Austin
Ahh, the many world's theory something I don't believe in
itanfall 3 wouldve been a better idea in my opinion
Austin!!!
Dear, Austin the server are the many worlds
You could use permutation computations to calculate the number of parallel universes, but the number of variables to take account into increases every second. Math is scary
Now it's time to make that number bigger as her decisions and movements affect how others react, thus the timeline she experiences is far more expansive than your relatively small numbers. Near infinity sounds about right.
What is that outro song? It's so amazing!
Lifeline > Mirage
Wraith is just Billie Eilish
The devs confirmed that the voices come from those shadows of herself when she‚Äôs in the void or rift walking
Austin question are you gay
You do realize that Respawn explained how Wraith works? Right?
bro, the Wired video is just this video but short
Oh my god. I'm sick of these ads
Austin love your videos <3
Wait. Aren‚Äôt there several wraiths who have found their past?
Have u ever seen titanfall 2 connect it to apex and eplain then
Wraith is best girl....
how many choices does a human brain make per second
Hey Austin's voice seems way less shrill in this episode. When did this happen? I'm gonna have to go back and watch all the videos since this change because I could never get through his videos in the past. I watched the Breath of the Wild video and that nearly hurt me physically.
New take on Austin
So evrey time you think you hear someon say somthing it's just your parallel self telling you you are going to do somthing stupid again.
YESSSSSS
Wraith is elizabeth
lmao y‚Äôall deleted the fnaf video
I‚Äôm a wild rabid titanfall fan whom is screaming for titanfall 3
I haven't been here in a while but what happened to matpat
Does anyone realize that there is two different thumbnails every time I open up YouTube for this video, I thought it was a new video
Did anyone get their mind blown? Cause mine did and I need a new one
Wraith 4: dies
Wraith 58: Theres a sniper, warn your teammates

I‚Äôve never had any issues with apex before
This video was gay, and it's not because the male narrator is in love with Mirage... wait, yes that's why this video is gay
I still love gas boi
DAWDAWDWDADWDDAWDAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why can't I watch the fnaf 7 vid
Austin: looks at mirage's face pic
Me: Hmmm, U gey
I WANT MATPAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey another Austin video
A new fnaf game is coming soon
All games predict the future at this point
Unexpectedly Wholesome
i followed you on tiktok
um can someone give me the name of the song? 5:05
I don't think that wraith's ability (to reach out and Converse with her alternate universe selves) is in and of itself psychic, but rather the WAY that she is able to tap into those other realities is the psychic part. in other words her powers aren't psychic the way she activates them is. At least that's what I think
Wow it's not like character designers already explained her powers just before this video came out lol
As soon as I hear ‚Äúdear‚Äù in a game theory I know it is going to be bad video
Shulks daughter lmao
Is it possible that wraith could run out of versions of herself if she keeps getting warnings of versions of herself who's died?
Did this dude just upload a fake FNAF video


*breaths*
Miraustin confirmed
Dear Austin,
I knew maining Wraith was a good idea! Great video Austin.
Sincerely, AnxietyRiddenMemesterLmao
Possibly the fact that Wraith has heard so many of her alternate selves has and the ability to do so has scattered her memory across universes that she exist in? So every wraith in every universe remembers something different about herself
The game does not take place post war it takes place during the war which is why the blood sport came to be due to the lack of a actully governing power
Why is the fnaf video gone üò™
MORE GAMINGS RICHEST!!!!!!
O my... Austin didn't shout.
Does anyone else think she looks a bit like Billie Eilish?
I didn't get this at all lol
Hey Austin
You dropped a subject title for theory of phasing is a shift into a gravitational plane... etc

Can you put links or have a separate video for that? Please/ thankyou
Damn, this video actually made me feel smart because I researched quantum mechanics and the ‚Äúmany worlds theory‚Äù so I understood this.
9:05 rip aim
Who else wants them to redo their old theories?
Next time get someone good to play the game.. I bet many people would do it for free.. No offense..
I noticed you uploaded a new fnaf vid then deleted it matpat.
Hey matt pat I just made a YouTube channel but I need a little help
Wraith = Billie Eilish ?
At 15:55 did you just get rid of a wingman for a p2020?!?
Yes but what if she only hears the endangered Wraiths? What I mean is, after the number is reduced by the least likely choices (as you did) , the number is further reduced by the number of wraiths that are not in danger. Also, if several wraiths have made slightly different choices but all reach the same outcome (e.g someone aims at your head with a sniper after exiting a building), wouldn't they technically count as one wraith? It would be strange to have 5,000 versions of her tell her the same damn thing
why cant wraith simply ask another wraith who was before this madness started? Wraith is using complicated answers to VERY simple issues...
Apex legends is literally better than Fortnite because it was made by Epic Games and legend(ary) is better than epic
but how do portal?
You were right in the nose. They are other versions of her.
Why is everyone gay for Mirage?
0:38 Doomfist disapproves
Game theory make a theory about oxenfree plz I just played it and it was mysterious and fun so ppl like if u agree
Can u do a theory on oxenfree i feel like there is a hidden lore
It's like The Prestige, but up to 11, or 111, or 1111, or whatever
So wraith has spidy scene, cool
i think that she has psychic abilities  because she travels through quantum tunnels (portals) and since they go through space and time her soul might be trapped in between the real world and the quantum world that's why she has no idea who she and that she can tell the furture
Is it bad that I literally clicked because I saw wraith BC WRAITH IS MAH MAINNNN
This isn‚Äôt her speaking to her self from other Dimensions, it‚Äôs her own subconscious instincts she was being experimented on for super soldiers by the icm
Austin sounds deranged
So is this why she lost her memory to much stress on her mind ?
Think about it some random guy who was probably not born in this timeline is watching this video
4th
I WANT MATPAT BACK.
I love the loud Austin
Why don't you finish your last video series about the richest video game characters
thank you i need something to think at night and not to sleep
Bro I hate Austin where the hell is matpak
I just wanna know the name of the song at the end
Another theory, subject: Wraiths portal. Maybe it‚Äôs the same science as her ability to run without taking damage from anything. When someone enters a portal it seems like they are in another parallel universe traveling and when it ends they return to their universe.  Maybe with the portal it allows her teammates to travel through parallel universes just as she does.
hey MatPat, can you try doing a ddlc theory cause it's 2019 so it's a bit late
can anyone else feel the weird life lesson i just had? or is it just really me...
Ok so you know how when octane runs, he carries his gun at a godly 90 angle? 

A standard lmg, such as the spitfire, weighs about 7.5 kilograms. It takes about 9 Newton's to lift 1 kilogram. This means that as octane runs, holding a spitfire, he is exerting 67.5 Newton's of force every half second, or 135 Newton's of force per second. 

Due to the fact that it takes 24 minutes to cross the map, this would mean that if he ran across the whole map (which he definitely could) he would have exerted 194,100 Newton's of force. 

The heaviest weight ever lifted by a human was 7000 pounds (about 3000 Newton's), meaning that Octane is technically be 64 times stronger than any human to ever exist.
@TwoSetViolin good backtrack at 2:53? (It‚Äôs a song I play in Orchestra - FRENCH HORN FTW)
I diagnose you with gay.
I love that dreamy jazz at the end over Mirage on the couch. What is it?
now do a video on holograms please
First
Use your old mic pls
That beginning tho
How long have I not watched game theory what happened to pat
The Many Worlds theory is a hard concept to understand, let alone explain, and you did it quite well Austin. That said, if anyone here has any more interest in the subject I would reccomend going and playing the Zero Escape games. They use the Many Worlds Theory as a major crux for their plot, so if anyone has interest in the subject try them out.
Years you have left to live

Make you'r own channel dude im sick and tierd of going to wach a video an then you apear i want mat  pat not you dude.
Wraith cannot lose because of her hitbox
Yeah but where's Petscop 2?
Wraith can‚Äôt see the future she just tells you when some ones aiming at you she can‚Äôt tell the future in an online game
6:16 looks like a butt hahhaahha
Oh my god his gameplay is so bad
check out the flying teacup if u wanna know about titanfall lore :)
isn‚Äôt wraith Billie eilish(no offence)
There has to be a timeline or another universe that makes this theory a little bit easier for Austin..
0:40 bro... You have a child.. they will see this one day... And it will be because of me
Speed-o sonic
Mirage kinda reminds me of Tracer from overwatch because of the suit and the goggles
Iz thiz guy gay
Why Wraith can't lose?  I prove this wrong every game.  HA!... ha.... kill me.
hos head exploded?
Wraith needs carmex
Hey Austin, I just wanted to ask about FNAF. In the end it show the grave stones of the kids buried, I just wanted to ask who's grave stone it is on top of the hill near the tree?
Wraith(?) = Vanya+amnesia
Whoever recorded the gameplay has inverted thumbs or just no thumbs at all...
What about kirby is villain pt 2
Why don't Gibby and Johnny5 get the love they deserve?
In the many worlds theory there is a universe where the only difference from this one is that one particle moved slightly farther.
Hi! I'm just here to tell you that this was posted 2 days after the official devs talked about each character in depth, and the inter-dimensional Wraith voices was confirmed by them so you are correct, but this video is too late. Sorry!
Tracer, the end.
so theres a timline where you have 0 subs
Screw this guy i want mat pat
I already learned this information from watching Steven Universe when Garnett explain the possibilities what would happen to an individual

 Between cross realities and universes and timelines there are about 1 of 1 trillion a different possibilities for an individual as well as their environment if not the entire universe even though this number seems relatively small I could easily go ahead and use a single Google but that would mean for every possibility there are more possibilities than there are atoms in the universe but let's go ahead and shrink it down to consumable size shall we

 Overall she's able to communicate with timelines that have her alive within a Split Second from her inevitable death possibly from a universe that's a second ahead of ours since multidimensional realities are not on a fixed time I have no doubt in my mind that there is a reality where the universe was born about 1 Millions before ours or there is a universe that's one millionth ahead of us similar to time zones for every reality there is different possibilities of how creation go on about leaving us to the great question I read the beginning time spectrum of the Multiverse in a quantifiable way the answer is no you're neither the beginning nor middle or end were similar in between the quarters it makes up the vast Multiverse whether we're close to the beginning or were far to the very end it would be difficult to go ahead and calculate even with a quantum computer you would need a universe computer to calculate those odds even then it would still be undecipherable
what happen if Wraith vs Wraith???
I hate when the game goes slow motion
i forgot what we were talking about at 7:08
Didn‚Äôt the creators verify a similar theory to this on a wired video?
WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!

(Rant here main point below : You build up so much stress that you have studied sooo much science and showing it off. So in the process you should never get your facts wrong, it makes you look annoying)
 they are electrons not molecules. Molecules have a definite position in a crystal structure . But still even when the molecule is loosely bound (gas) you can always determine its velocity and position . Not with an electron according to Heisenberg the Momentum and position cannot be determined at the same time (meaning either you can get the velocity or the position)

Quantum superposition is being in multiple states in the same time . It is not a space where you can find electrons DUMMY
Damn it,I thought I was gonna mind blown people with my own theory but Im not the only who thinks of this theoryüòíüòíüòë
Wait... where‚Äôs mat
Bloodhound is better
You always kill the best people
I WANT THAT T-SHIRT FROM THE BEGINNING
I am confused
Please explain how in one round there r multiple raths and other characters
Is Austin bisexual?
It was already known
I came here to check how to spell sincerely so i moved my mouse to the end and suddenly 0:19
The campaign of Titanfall 3 could be wraith waking up in the mental hospital and her journey to find information and then to the Apex games
Is that dandruff in your hair?
Oooh but who‚Äôs ready for fnaf VR?
She also says "I've seen every path, nothing phases me".
He looks like sonic from one punch man? Even the purple stripes and bun
I think she's related to the time manipulation experiment from titanfall 2
the multiverse theory doesnt really work because everything in the universe has a trigger, nothing is random which even means that the history of the whole universe is already written down, but hey thats just a theory, a Quantum theory
According to many worlds theory. And the chance of life. We Should be all contacted at least bzzzzilions of times a second by other alt lines. Thus it is disproved. However other dimensions is real. And aliens. Should. Buy haven't talked to us. So they aren't real either. We have a god. He sits after spinning the marble and watches it go round. At times doing nothing at all. Accept it maybe. Because by chance alone you should be proven right. And you aren't. So think about that.
Dear Austin and anyone who reads this comment,

One thing that has always troubled me about the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment is that this experiment, in my opinion, should only works when the cat is dead in the box. This is because when the cat is alive, itself should becomes the observer in the situation, thus collapsing the superposition. However, this contradicts the main idea, as it has to die first to be both simultaneously alive and dead.

This then raises another question, if we put a live cat in a box and bury it for a very long time without food or water can we still say that it is both alive and dead simultaneously without opening the box? Biologically it is proven countless times that there no possibility of a cat to live without water, food or air for a very long time. Doesn't this mean that our basic scientific method becomes flawed as it is basically our measurement that insure the death of the half dead and half basically immortal cat and not the experiment itself, of which we wanted to measure.

As a final question, if we put a dead cat in a box, can the cat go back into the state of superposition? Since there is no more observer on the dead cat, wouldn't that make it so that the cat can goes back into a state of superposition? From this couldn't we also deduce that the cat can become dead and alive once the box closes. Because of the fact that we are dealing with possibilities here, we cannot prove that revival of the cat isn't a possible outcome in this situation.

Also, just to add on to this idea, if we replace cat with humans and every box with coffins in the paragraph above, it become quite terrifying. And also, is it me or does this quantum superposition resembles the power that the weeping angels in Doctor Who have. Anyway, thank you for taking your time to read this far.

Truly yours,



Bobby Bobster :)


Edit: also please forgive me if there is any conceptual mistakes.
Dear Austain, there is a weather occurancr in Legends of Zelda Breath of the Wild that has confused me; If you get caught in a storm in the game, than lightning will randomly hit, and some strikes can strike 15 feet away from link without killing him; So I ask you now, in this comment, what would happen of that really happened to someone?
It‚Äôs not that Wraith is statistically better than others, it‚Äùs just that every edgy teenager (who are usually better than others) plays her.
Wraith is just Dave Strider.
Austin is VERY VERY VERY gay and not in the happy version of that
When wraith talks you can hear herself a little quieter in the background so you can hear her more than once when she talks
there is a new fnaf game
I wish that they made Pathfinders hook actually useable
Sooo does each match you start within apex is technically a different choice within different timelines and that apex is just 1 match within an infinite different timelines?
If wraith uses the many world theory than there would be a lot of choices that would affect the voices from other timelines such as her not going on the apex games at all to look for answers and her choosing not to warn herself in a different timeline
Lol ok Austin. Now figure out which wraith doesnt die.
In the beginning he said that the game starts laggy. I thought I was the only one
Why no intro
fortnite is better
Nooooooooo!!!!!!
now do this irl
That 4x recoil burst control tho, disgusting
I never knew Austin was gay
If you think about it, it means if you die in the game as wraith, your death actually saves another wraith in another world
Who's faster Mario doing a blj or sans?
Austin does is gay for mirage
I am bloth hoondr
Okay Auston, I lnow you somewhat acknowledged this in the video, but I feel like pointing out that scientists have recently discovered data / a particle that effects the many-worlds theory vs. The Single-universe / Singularity theory & based on the #'s the data leans ever so slightly closer to the single-universe theory. This'd potentially debunk the many-worlds theory. This finding was broadcast on TV, I believe on the Discovery channel, along with 'How Planets Are Made'.
Is this c# or what 0:08
Where did you get that word 7:20
That means there is a Wraith that doesnt compete in Apex that receives signals of her death over and over again. And she is the craziest version of herself.
I honestly don't know if I lose or gain brain cells watching this.
Undyne= Uneyed
what if theres a universe where moniculs act difrent then that universe could break the way the other universes work for example one wraith lives in a world wheres she is immortal and can transfer the particals that make her immortal?
Apex backstory is so wrong
Apex and borderlands are very similar
My name is Austin
Yo is Austin actually gay
Like:MatPat

Reply:Austin 

Who‚Äôs better at making GameTheory‚Äôs
She will be able to lose once they widen her hitbox...
We miss matpat
Stop watching firefly it‚Äôs trash
üòñ
Wraith has an ability to phase shift, much like Titanfall 2‚Äôs ability, except that you were harder to track. In lore, the IMC most likely tried to make phase shifting easier for non-simulacrums, as maybe it could be dangerous for humans to phase shift without the necesarry support (Hence, ronin) The phase dimension didnt really have a name given by respawn so fans just named it the phase dimension, now we have a name. The void.
Is Austin Dutch?
5:05 what game is that?
To give an even scarier understanding of how big the Many Worlds Theory is: All of the various worlds Austin brought up came from ONE PERSON'S choices. Yup, those numbers with way too many zeros, just that one person making choices. That's not including the other BILLIONS OF PEOPLE also making choices, with each one creating a new universe. That's how big Many Worlds Theory Is.
So I don't play Apex Legends ...A thought came across my mind, however, and that thought was - what if the voices stop communicating with her even when she's confronted with dangerous situations, and yet they still could communicate to warn her? The answer is most likely that she's not in any danger of dying in all possibilities since there is no communication whatsoever - basically meaning this Wraith is maybe the True Wraith due to basically being invincible, and could be known as what we like to call the, "Chosen One", among all Wraiths.  Surprisingly though, it might just be that the possibility is that far off from the current path of that particular Wraith, which could also explain the lack of any communication from herself. Another thought that could be true is that every Wraith from every parallel, maybe  even far off, or just plain different timeline starting from that very point where Wraith no longer receives communication from herself, though she certainly still could if the need were to arrive ...Could mean that each of those Wraiths will no longer be in any danger. 


My brain is hurting now :)
since I¬¥m stupid, I can¬¥t even begin to imagine what it would be like to have mind/brain like Austin here has but, I¬¥m pretty sure it can be quite scary and angst inducing from time to time.. most of the time tho, probably pretty awesome..
I have not watched the full video, but ever since I was 11 I always wondered if I have two choices ahead of me and chose one over the other, would I be the one creating a parallel universe ? or is the parallel universe there from the start following me through life until I reach this decision and then splitting off ?
I think i heard Israel's anthem in 2:50
Austin why didn‚Äôt you win any games
I believe all of wraith dimensions are collapsing in her that‚Äôs why she looks alive and dead
Isn‚Äôt wraith schizophrenic
Does anyone know what the song is that starts playing around 5:10? It sounds super catchy! (I tried to look, but no music-credits in the dooblydoo.)
then would she know how she is by now
1:41 also the portal episode
Austin! Are you gay?! I mean I don't mind it is just I dunno
I want that shirt at the beginning
Austin is gay?
Oh ....
Were mat pat
I learned superposition from Teen Titans go.
Wraith looks an awful lot like Sonic from OPM, but is a woman.
Is Austin gay???
wtf Austin is gay
You‚Äôre the odd 1 out
She really does look like Speed o' Sound Sonic...
If it is a network of several human brains in all likelyhood they'd have come to terms with it or die, remember we are not talking about one person we are talking about as many choices as people.
where is matpat
What do you predict will happen in the future of gaming for a year, five years and then ten years to the future?
Dear Austin, hi its a fan. Bring back ShoddyCast back please.
Austin are you gay
what the music?
I don't think its multiples of her talking to each other. Idk what the voice lines are about but personally i think the most likely scenario is that theres some otherworldly force like the force from star wars thats just seeing things that might be a danger to her and warning her, like the description of her power is in game that theres something whispering to her and she doesnt know if its good or evil or whatever. and the reason its using her voice is cuz it doesnt have a voice of its own so when it speaks to her her brain just interprets the speech as a warped version of her own internal monologue i.e. her own voice
At least Austin has confirmed one theory in this video... that he is gay.
where is matpat
So wraith is the reason so many apex games can happen, are happening, and will happen in the future...
is austin gay or european?
I don‚Äôt ever have lag issues
I think i know why she has amnesia as you now for a new memory they have to remove a memory so that means that she has removed so many memories that she doesn't know anything before she got the powers
My name is Austin
Ok that's gay
Teen titans go!!!! Only ttg fans know this......
Men what is that hispan like music starting at 13:08? Its amazing.
So does this mean there is some realm where my crush likes me back???
Wait fnaf sl what if ennard was purple guy when he got scooped but purple man isn't even evil
Tbh fortnite > apex
Hey mat
I kinda hate Austin
Austin this is not just a theory the respawn team did confirm this and those fakeish things u see when she uses her into the void is herself in another dimention
YUP PEDO
Thanks Austin. All the stuff you say in the last 2 minutes of this video is genuinely appreciated. You never know when you happen on just the right video you need to see to get your sorry self out and about and quit my depressive bitchin haha.
So basically Wraith is Byakuran
Who in side of redbear
But then is there a universe where wraith knows her past?
What song is playing in the video?
I feel like every science thing has something to do with waves, light? Wave theory. Sound? Waves of air. Molecules? Position determined by waves.
Stupid and sassy Jim Raynor
Is Austin gay
Mozambic here
Soooooooooo, Austin is gay now?
I have a qustion about fanaf why did we never get to discover the pizza place and is it over? Don't think so
Wait it is gray
Your way better than MatPat
The distortion to the voice could also be from interference from all her other selves talking about less time sensitive stuff while the "signals" from those that are saying the same thing stack on top of each other to boost the "signal" high enough so others hear it clear enough in their universe and that half-ish second could be from probability rolling it so the events happened sooner so those whispers you get could literally be the last thoughts coming from an unimaginable number of your dying selves as they desperately seek to relay the valuable information to the rest before all of their brain cells die. In theory(TM).
Is it weird that this scares me
How much would it cost in usd to buy enough currency to completely max out clash of clans? Yes it‚Äôs a mobile game but it‚Äôd definitely be a ridiculous figure when you factor in just how much each upgrade and item cost and the cost in gems (which are obtained through purchasing with real currency) to skip the wait time for upgrades.
whats the music
am i the only one that has no idea what he's talking about but still gets entertained by the video?
Wait Austin is gay
MatPat is better
I've been imagining shadows of myself doing things slightly differently than myself for like 2 minutes now and it's been doing the equivalent of slowing down my frame rate but for humans. In fact there's probably another me who typed out this comment flawlessly first time and said exactly what I was  trying to say  with the frame rate but actual professional terms. It's kinda freaky.
Its easy to see why.
Not market
Yeeeeeeee wheres mat pat
So Wraith's powers is like Byakuran from  KHR
15:32 I really needed that pep talk
Like if name is shamus
There are no other worlds
Song?
Dude you‚Äôre fanboying over mirage but you should explain him more than anybody EXPLAIN HOW HE MAKES IMAGINARY CLONE OF HIMSELF
He's here he's there he's every where who you gonna call cycet friend free bear new fnaf game soon
She also says : I am jumpmaster,this time...
What happened to matpat
Isn‚Äôt there a power in titan fall 2 that is similar to wraith tho? The robot that can warp or something. It can even warp into the titan as a faster way to enter your titan.
Okay new math problem for ya. How many shots can you land between 200-300 yards while using a prowler with a 4x zoom? Lol
More theories
Where is the fnaf 7 theory
You know the designers of wraith already mentioned what her voices are. Everytime you go into the void, you see other ghost like looking versions of wraith. Those are other wraiths from infinite dimensions in the void at the same time she is. The void acts like a window that one wraith can view another wraith from. So anytime she hears a voice, it's actually just another wraith from a different reality warning her because she's currently looking at her through the void. That's the explaination they gave for wraiths passive.
Market where are youuuuuu!!!!
Dear matpat whu do you have closed captions auto gen it makes it confusing when I watch it in school
Wait a minute if this theory is true and wraith can talk to herself from other "worlds" and she is participating in the apex legends blood sport to find out what happens in her past then doesn't that mean there is a "world" where she can remember what happened in her past and if so cant she just talk with that version of herself?
So wraiths warning is the same as the spidy sense ?
Where is Mat?
I find it funny how the "Schrodinger's Cat" thought experiment was intended to make no sense. Schrodinger was trying to show how stupid the duality of light being both a particle and a wave was.
I couldn't hear anything over the loud annoying over the top host..
Yelling

Net code ain't even a legit terms why do you guys use it
10:30 I looked away from my screen to revert my attention to think a strain of hair was on my phone...
Here comes the MONEYYYYYYYYYY
In titan fall 2 it kind of explains how she phases and what dimension type world it is when you phase in the campaign
new fnaf 7 and based on new info remember 5 combined into one matt
D4C
Funny thing about Many Worlds Theory if true: everything is true. Even if every universe has the exact same laws of physics, there will be universes out there where events of unimaginable improbability happen with incredible regularity. To the inhabitants of that universe, the laws will be entirely different. So every possible way that could ever be for the laws of physics will be true somewhere. There is absolutely no situation that isn't true in Many Worlds. Our laws of physics as we see them could literally be among the least likely, and we could have no idea. Not that likely even matters, because infinite improbability removes any level of meaning to that anyway.
Hi sans.
y u using turtle?
Song name?
So she‚Äôs dr.strange without the infinity stone
Was it a joke or is Austin gay?
Great video
Sooo been a while since I watched game theory WHO TF IS AUSTIN?
Did he delete the new fnaf video?
If Wraith powers coralates to the "Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Machanics" were each tic creates a infinite probabal universe, and she is aware of these probable universes, that means Wraith her self is part of that probable universes, and when she dies, she becomes one of those voices
That power sounds cool af but hearing yourself die? All the time? No wonder she woke up in a mental hospital. Christ, that would drive you insane.
More apex
Tbh i dont think thats true because when someone aims at wraith the act has been already done so in my opinion she sees every thing that happens to her and she mutes out the obvious ones and only hears the important ones.
Hi
????
But Thats Just a Theory! Hihihi
We're is matt Pat burning home back he is better sorry Austin
Apex gay
please. i am deadly seriously serious. please. stop yelling your entire lines. just calmly explain your info.
This theory also explains how she almost got mad from her voices, as there must‚Äôve been thousands of voices all talking on her head at once. When she learned to possibly separate these voices and hear them separately, she realized that they could help her.
I just simultaneously whipped and nae naed!
ok
Poor guy
Mediocre job on the name censorship guys, blurring the kill feed was alright, but there were still names on death banners and teammates. I understand that editing takes a long time, but still.
The song at 13:08 sounds strangely familiar to me. Anyone know where it‚Äôs from cuz this shits bugging me
Can you tell matpat a new fnaf game is coming and it is in vr it's called fnaf help wanted
Dam that was impressing also a fun fact when you inter the rift you can see other holograms of wraith slightly appearing its the other possible incomes that could've happend
The other worlds theory or whatever is further supported by the fact that she can see her self   when phasing.(The blurry human looking figures)
Austin
Tfw there are infinite universes created beyond just observing dead goombas. In fact I just created over 2.1 million different universes right now where everything played out the same as eachother universe except I decided to breathe one second later for this specific timeframe where I could've begun breathing over 2.1 million times earlier. An incredibly insignificant change between universes but they are different nevertheless and so many to boot. And this is just talking about breathing if life were akin to an internet server tick and not the universe tick that is explained later in the video. We very quickly reach the quintillion different universes made all the way to infinite where everything is the same except one single thing across the entire lifespan of that universe compared to another.
You have The Big Gay?
I can't watch this with the mirage crap... Sorry
PARALLEL UNIVERSE i heard that some where probably it's something that a company has been working on it for 80 years and the company's name probably starts with an m and it's 6 words and i think their name was MARVEL
Thank you for the FireFly reference!! #WewantFireFlyBack!
THIS time the goomba is dead
How any goombas did you kill to get them dead
So you are trying to tell us that were all making alot of universes??????????
THAT MEANS I CAN CALL THEM ALL JEFF KAPLAN
So...Wraith is cheating?
That's what I figured from the video...she is teaming up with not only 2 people but like A LOT
16:05 Thank you i really needed to hear that today.
i can relate so much to austins love for mirage
Reminds me of the quantum superposistion effect described in Liu Ci Xin's 'Ball lightning'. The destroyed matter is in a probability cloud where observers determine the probability of it's state. Mind boggling!
I love the use of Smetna My Vlast at 3:01
Matpat when are you going to make doki doki literature club video
Holy crap! Austin hardly yelled, and didn't even need to try to not yell. I'm proud of you!
Austin, this is about apex legends, not Marioplex's
Or maybe she is communicating with one that is exactly .5 seconds in front of her with no other changes
7:21 thats dutch...wha
dutch editor?
Wraith does talk a lot about choices....
Im watching this video as I type this, I always thought the voice was just a future version of Wraith or something like that, or maybe something from a time not yet arrived.
I'm getting a heart attack from this
I don‚Äôt like Austin I only like Matt:(
Sucking off on mirage I see. Giving moto moto a run for his money
Do a theory on red dead redemption 2
Why not make a vid about how powerful being hit by pathfinder while he swings would be.
Just watch the WIRED video on Apex Legends lmao
Why Wraith Cannot Lose!
IN-LORE: Explains theoretical physics, quantum mechanics, and many worlds theory
Game-Mechanics: Her hitbox is smallest.
No science of mirage. Or caustics gas? Or the possibility of Gibraltars shield? So many better things than wraith to make a game theory on. And it actually would have some realism.
Oh good the game theorist people actually like is back
Well this theory is basically confirmed by respawn wired did a video on all the characters described by the devs and they say basically this
For some reason, I was expecting to hear Austin scream that Wraith's powers were tearing apart the fabric of space-time and instead it ended with something kinda uplifting...
I know this really isnt a theory but could you do a Sally face explanation of the time line and what not
That theory sounds like the thing in Bandersnatch
This ability is basically the stand Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (D4C) from Jojo's.
I love Wraith. Great character, great concept although I personally think it was executed poorly. I'm sure the game devs are doing their best to try balancing the game so she's not overpowered but when an ability that is suppose to warn you about incoming danger only goes off after the danger happened then she might as well not have that ability.
Again, from my experiences (Maybe I'm doing something wrong) her passive and ultimate are useless. Her passive is literally just another useless teammate. It's always the same thing, I get shot at, almost get downed (in most cases actually get downed), get in cover then I'll get a warning that there's someone shooting me.
Her ult is a bit more useful, it can help your team get away from a tight spot in a gunfight but otherwise just feels like a worse version of Pathfinders zip-line.
Could you do an episode about caustic nox gas.
Is that a f**king Vltava track in the background? My Czech patriot genes are itching right now!
So that gravitational portal dimension thing is coming next episode right austin?
"Verdorie."  I laughed.
the science of funny valentine jojo that would be interesting.
Can we get a borderlands theroy if 3 is coming out
For the past year, I wanna know how Sonic can move forward in the air during his homing attack
Is it bad that I figured that it was the many worlds theory for Wraith's powers literally within the first couple hours of gameplay?
why dident you link matpats vid that contains the many worlds theort
Next up:
How Pathfinder is the most positive video game character in history.
Is it just me or does Wraith look like Speed O' Sound Sonic from One Punch Man
Now I will tell you a story a story about a Doctor skeleton who wanted to create artificial souls for the king of monsters his first experiment was W-S. W-S was curious he wandered around the lab looking for something to do. He went back to the Doctor and he saw a new skeleton named D-P. W-S was very happy to see a new friend they played together they eat together they where like BROTHERS. &:$;):&:@/G:@4@(83$:$;8(&:!;8(‚Äò&($;7($:!48(&4$38;&!3A@3;@;&!:);(&(9;$3$(&(8$:)2$;&;$3!;&(8:S@:39;&;$;&/83$;&(8:$3!/&T;‚Äô$:&;$:$;&;7:$3$;8(72$38488372);!,892$;!(82$E&:$;$,:93!;!38374$38/!;!@-!!:;&!2;$;8$42!R!!!! 





Part 1 of the story


Want part 2 look at your Kirby is a threat video
8:18 I am impressed with this character.throughly!!!
Watching this while trying to be the dancer of the Boreal valley thanks for the advice Austin
I want these guys as my math teacher instead... Actually I want a lot of YouTuber's as my teacher
Fun fact: you can see other wraith "shadows" when she goes into the void
Easier concept: timeline
16:13 Look out, I think Mirage likes you
The real question is who pathfinder owners
Scott games website image says remember Jeremy. I think there is more that we have yet to see
So Everytime you start up a new match you‚Äôre basically playing one of the millions of wraiths. Crazy
and you said wraith gets to much info we just got loaded with it lol
Matt WHERE ARE YOUUU???
If u can phase into infinite dimensions abd the voices u here are infinite other versions of u tryna help u on ur journey amnesia is a great tool CUZ WHO TF WHATS TO REMEMBER ALL THAT
This is long over due!
9:04 cracked me up !
You need to do a theory on marry Poppins returns.
‚ÄúVerdorie‚Äù means dammit in dutchüòÜ
Glad to know I am not the only one with insufferable lag for the first two minutes of every game.
Aaww my sweet baby Austin and why does she remind me of that character from One Punch Man? The speedy guy?
I feel like my mind has opened up... like that scene when Neo learns kung fu
You finally made a good video. üëè
All i can hear is Maxmoefoe saying "But I Aint Gay"
I‚Äôm the one who came up with the idea for this video and I didn‚Äôt get credit üò• I commented it on the subnautica episode (I think) about a month ago
soooo she's the reincarnation of Zelretch?
This was beautiful, Austin
So... you are talking about self-learning AI but organic ???
gibraltar > wraith

fight me
I'm learning so much
wow not much screaming today
How can you tell the Russian dance kazonava dance or something like that but how can you tell
Real fans listen to this mind bobbling mess at 2x speed
and yet when sans has failed, their whole universe's been destroyed, and he knows he'll somehow sometime. can't get a break, can ya?
Sorry I‚Äôm one of the 4 people who play blackout
Semi off topic, but nihilism to me means exactly this. Nothing in this world, is greater or less in worth or meaning than anything else.
IE that blade of grass means and is worth as much as you, and you are as worth and as much as sun is to the existence of other human beings. Everyone and everything, though sheer existence is equal.
Nihilism doesn't have to mean that things don't matter, what it means is that everything matters equally in the consequence of the universe. You are as important as anyone else. You are worth as much as anyone and anything else. Because we all exist at all, we matter, even if that amount might be smaller than we thought, nothing matters more or less than us.




I really enjoyed this theory actually. Would be really trippy if they confirmed the voices as being her in other dimensions when you play.
The many worlds theory is also the only way we could understand time travel. Unless we find a way to only ever go forward in time, but not back, which isn't really travel, as you are perma there when you get to that time and space unless you wanna go forward again.
I never understood the simpified version but the compex ones pretty comprehensive
I mean, when she void shifted, you can see outlines of others, black forms that move within the void so...
i actually really like this theory
so you are saying there is a univers where i have won in everything and never lost once??
This was a really good video. Thanks for making it!
And this is why system 0 drove minor characters mad in Gundam Wing.
Hmm... sounds like a certain D-class in SCP Containment Breach.
Wraith reminds me of "speed o sound" From one punch man
stop using the same box!!
ummm... what happened to finishing The Quest to find the Richest Video Game Character?
It is funny how accurate Respawn has been with this.  I watched a video yesterday on WIRED that was the Respawn devs talking about and explaining each character. They explained Wraith under the Multi-world theory. They said that the phantoms when she phases are other versions of herself passing through the void at the same time, and the void is a space between dimensions, or other worlds. They explained the voices as being herself, warning her of the next possible future that another version of herself, just experienced, and is warning that version about in order to prevent it from happening.
I really like Austen's videos. Can we have more of them?
wait the thumbnail and the title changed.. wth ?
I have always had such a hard time understanding schroedinger‚Äôs cat but you FINALLY made it make sense.
But when you get Mozambique
They said this entire theory in her intro cinematic
Eyes on the inside=willem from bloodborne=Austin is bloodborne
I don't know if anyone else pointed this out. I believe Austin meant subatomic particles instead of molecules.
what happened to the series about the richest character?
Wait, Apex legends is in the same universe as Titanfall? awesome. Although there doesn't seem to be any giant robots so that's disappointing
So Wraith is basically Sans
Lifeline > wraith
oh, you used math to find the solution and here I am using meth.
So... Garnet = wraith
The many worlds theory is confirmed canon in Titan fall 2's campaign, now I wonder if every player match of apex legends is canonical, just in different timelines.
Wraith:
"I have been through this scenario over 2 quintillion times and I have become exceedingly efficient at it..."
the dead cat thing is like a quantum computer, the binary characters are both 0's and 1's at the same time, therefore basically
 infinite computing power
maybe look at Titanfall 2 since it has a phase shift ability plus same universe and such
I realllllllllllyyy have the same feelings about Mirage, but who doesn't.
Vsauce's videos changed a little bit...
Since austin likes mirage now, does that mean he's forgotten about sombra and doomfist
please. stop. sexualizing. fictional. characters.
How can you just dislike???
Actually in the cinematic movie trailer the Gibraltar magazine at the start says it‚Äôs the 124th season of apex so I believe this is 124 years after Titanfall
that was so wholesome somehow
Poor Austin
I don‚Äôt think she chooses the worlds. She is just like ‚Äònope you ain‚Äôt killin me today buddy‚Äô
So basically no matter what wraith wins. Wraith loses, wraith wins?
1k dislikes are from Fortnite fans.
Dude you were right, Wired just released a video where they say that when Wraith heres voices its the other versions of herself in the midst of the dimensional travel that is warning her.
Austin this might make you angry so read this looking at mirage, you forgot to calculate player deaths and health and all that jazz
Where is matpad
Many worlds theory and DBZ timelines.... why does DB only have like 7 timelines?
where is matpat
Misogyny and homoerotic fantasy within the span of 10 seconds...

What a juxtapose.
So if the multiple universes theory is real, for every human on earth, there are 7 quintillion new worlds per 33ms?


Thats crazy^^
Wait didnt matpat do this but with super mario maker?
Oof
WHY AUSTIN






JK LOVE U BRO
I will tell you a joke





Memory 0x000000 cant be read
I've seen this before
If you are watching "one piece " you will know
it's the power of  Doa Doa no Mi  or Door-Door Fruit
ah Austin, I see your a fan of the wrath, Bangalore and lifeline combo
Wraith doesn't use teleportation, she travels between dimensions, by jumping into the the void, which is the center of all universe's and different possibilities.
12.50 The tick of universe is of course counted with the fastest think in world, light
Tracer vs Wraith? hint hint
coooome on...... coooome on..... you know you want to tackle that.... cooome on
mama voice
KINDERGARTEN 2!!!
They talk about this in the WIRED talk about every character
Heres a theory (spoilers for umbrella academy)







 when 5 from umbrella academy warps at the end of season 1 his body turns into a woman's and he becomes wraith
Anyone knows whats the music in bg? Starts at 5:05
The second I hear Austins Voice I lose the interest in the Video
Omg you were right
Inb4 hit box jokes
This gave me a stomach ach
where is matpat
This guy is so smart
Future Wraith: move your getting aimed at
Wraith: ok moves out of position
Future Future Wraith: dont go that way! Theres another team
Wraith: uh......
You have done your absolute best to explain all of this and Sir, you did a amazing job,
Wraith's past is that she was secretly sonic from one-punch man
Anyone else getting strong Nezumi, from J≈´ni Taisen, vibes?
so she is Byakuran from Hitman Reborn?
She's either a winner helped by failures or a failure helping winners
Apex gives me strong Dishonored Vibes. srsly
So Wraith is basically Spider-man.
7:21, no u
That's Dutch, not Deutsch.
DEUTSCH WA DUTCH JANAI! YAMEROOOOOOOOO
I can't even get apex legends to run on my pc
Shes a Lilith Clone
Because her hit box is smaller and she has abilities to help make hitting her even harder
Quantum powers eh?
0:29 Austin why you remind me that Hawking has passed :(((((((((((((((
Whyd the title change?
0:43 bottem right corner. ester egg
Yes
I thought she could predict the future
matpat go to duck season and go to the right wall and look at the top picture the dog was there the hole time
Where do I buy this shirt
Wait, Austin. Were you using the tracer command to speed up the stuff in Python? You would be able to fit everything in a snap using it.
THIRSTY BI AUSTIN IS MY FAVE AUSTIN
NOW WE NEED A MIRAGE VIDEO AUSTIN!!!
If she could choose the timelines he could do almost anythings
Hands down the best videos on Youtube.
Why use science and not just except that it's real void
Awwyiss, gimme dat Mirage sugar.
Wraith cant lose cause her hitbox is 1/2 the size of mine (caustic) while we both go the same speed.
Bunny girl senpai
Did not see some MatPat in GT anymore. Where is he
i just relise that there are two people running this channel
30 years after Titan Fall
The voices in her head are just another spectator from  another worlds
Where's the money video; you promised
What happened to the richest character series?
Hehehe Elon muskquito
This means that at least one wraith doesn't have amnesia and could tell her who she is
Is Austin gay?
mat pat is better
Austin should make his own YT channel
Are you A/B testing your thumbnails or reupload them? It drives me crazy!
I don't know when you wrote this but the multiverse part of the theory was supported by an interview of the game designers on WIRED
15:57 He just dropped a wingman for an RE-45
Is the richest  video game characters of all time gonna be like the game theory  two parter  where part one comes out and part 2 never does
one thing id like to say :
all the parallel universe thing happen in real time like
if im typing this command in this time line
other me  is playing with some other thing
its true that we are doing different things and maybe we somehow can communicate with each other but all this things happen at the same time and i think there is no way that like i can worn myself about future 
idk if you get my point or not but ok
Makes me think of the Doctor Who episode, Turn Left
Yo Austin this vid helped me a lot thx
Some one has an eye on Mirage
So respawning is just going into another universe if it doesn't make sense? Cool
Hot crust buns time!!
Honestly my theory was that it was only one universe and the wraith from a time a bit in the future telling her
Well hello there, male Tracer.
Bout GOD DAMN TIME
Why did you change the thumbnail
I remeber Halo but if your 6 years old and born in 2013 basicly your fresh from the woom you would play Apex legends
Can you try to come up with a theory about the new twisted visual novel‚ÄùBeyond you‚Äù it‚Äôs kinda like ddlc
im expacting an austin x mirage by the end of the week
Thank you
what a \\funny valentine\\
Hey mat pat,

01101000 01110100 01110100 01110000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01110001 01110010 00101110 01110111 00110110 00111001 01100010 00101110 01100011 01101111 01101101 00101111 01100111 00101111 01110100 00110101 01110101 01111010 01110111 01111001 01110111 01011010 01000111
Everyone: hates Austin's screaming
Austin: manages to stop screaming
Everyone: wonders where the screaming went

Looks like Wraith isn't your main.
Sadly, Respawn made a statement about how Wraith works 2 days ago. Impressively, you used science and in-game clues to come up with the same explanation they did. Good job Austin
Well, if Wraith in the game is making new universes, then you, the player, is also creating new universes by reloading, shooting, ect.
Confirmed
Austins gay.
I swear if we tackle the 999 game series XD
Is there an alternate universe where there are no alternate universe's...
Holy shhhh..
So what this means is....every player that plays Wraith, in every match that has ever been and will ever be is simultaneously helping another wraith player or themselves in another timeline.
Soooooooo......she‚Äôs byakuran from Katekyo Hitman Reborn?
I call BS. My buddy is Wraith main and he loses 95.535% of the time.
HARVARD WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
Wait so no one else hears voices
Hey where did pat go
15:56 he said replaced a wingman with an RE-45
Does anybody know the song at 13:08
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE PUBG ISLANDS???
Hey... Thanks for FNAF theories. They got me interested in the game not because of the horror aspect, but the story itself! And I have been piecing together your theories about the books... In my own opinion, you are almost correct, the Charlie that is in the box is a real human being, not a machine. The other Charlie was actually baby in disguise. And yes, Afton's daughter is inside baby, that is 100% correct. thanks for reading this and please let me know what you think and respond. üëç
weres mat pat
aaaaaaaaaaaand everyone thinks austin is gay now
Verdorie
Jumping onto every game that is the most popular, aren't ya?
0:20 why would they fix net code? When they can rather "fix" scam battle pass into the game.

Scam & spy live service for everybody!
Austin can you ask MATPAT if he watches the odd 1s out

P.S. the odd 1s out and Austin and MATPAT is awesome üßêü§Øü§´
The conclusion speech sounds like it could work just as fine for Undertale as for Wraith üòÇ
Isnt that a One Punch Man character? 
I watched the video because of this xD greay vid tho..
Now I can proove to my friends that Wraith isn't bad and I WAS RIGHT
//game.lag(15) // sorry. 

the second // is unnecessary because the entire line will already be commented out.

also Schrodinger was Austrian, where they speak German. "Verdorie" is Dutch, not German
6:40 IS NOT RANDOM AT ALL! You just think is random because you can't measure it(yet) or your imagination can't grasp it.
i just watched respawn workers discuss each character for APEX, not sure if you're aware of it but you're pretty close to the thinking behind wraith. The fazing is her traveling through dimensions. if you look closely while she is fazing, you can see other wraith figures running around.
AUSTIN THE BICON
"please fix your code" blah blah "laggy mess for the first 2 minutes of every match" blah blah "which leads to crashing"

Oh good, I thought that crap was just my bad pc screaming. They say you must meet the requirements but my pc doesn't really meet the minimum lol only in the 6 gb of ram. However it runs great, some lag, but that's expected.. What annoys me is the crashing that has literally no reason to happen.
Thumbnail change at 6 am est
Basically d4c with steroid
you spelt Seamus wrong
Mirage( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Dear austin tslk about the zero escape franchise
isn't that guy from one punch man?
15:48 - 16:09 Austin is the best, well said
Austin youre cringe
Plz nerf
12:45 lel the universe has 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000fps
I clicked on and I her the voice of the yelling middle aged man

First thing I thought in my head was Austin thank god a change of pace 

No disrespect Matthew
this is my favorite legend...
I was hoping this was going to be an analysis about why Wraith was objectively the most powerful legend to play as because of the psychology of her movement or hit boxes or something
Hey Austin,
How does the many world theory works with scientific determinism?
The SCIENCE is really the only thing i watch from Game Theory anymore. Thanks Austin!
Lol I didn't know you had (a) Dutch editor(s)
acually respawn already confermed that she does talk with other wraiths from other deminsions
hey the apex devs actually confirmed the many worlds theory for wraith and they said that when phasing it to the void you can see kinda like shadows of diffrent wraiths
Oh hey austin! Why you!
Schrodinger's box is such nonsense.
i should sleep
Austins obsession with putting gumbas in boxes explains why gyging gumba left the channel
But can spiders predict the future
Me: dies as wraith
Hey it's Austin he review techs
If the many worlds theory is fact, I wonder how old the oldest me would be when I die, and if the world I am currently writing this in will be that timeline. Probably not though. Damn.
at last Austin didn't rage quit
Wraith can't lose cause all the hackers play her for the small hitbox.
Actually, if we go by your theory she is not only a supernatural being she is close to being God or even better. It is much more likely that she can calculate a deterministic world than consider multiple worlds outcome and that is also more likely to be our world. Regardless it is a superpower.
People having well thought out discussions in the comments while all I can think about is Schr√∂dinger saying "Verdorie" at 7:20 while he was Austrian where they speak German, not Dutch! Verdammt noch mal!
who came here just becuz Apex legends cough cough best game in 2019  was in the title






just me?
ok ._.
Titanfall 2 is the best modern (recently released) shooter by a long shot. Prove me wrong
Didnt the writers already talk about this on the recent WIRED video?
yes. yes. YESSSSS
I was here before the thumbnail changed
so she is literally Byakuran from Hitman Reborn got it.
When you cant see something could the goomba be anything?
This Science was reaaally cool
They say "A wise man learns from the mistakes of others; a fool from their own."  I wonder what they would call her?
Wow...
I really despise the many worlds theory as it doesn't make sense for an entire gigantic mass of the whole universe to suddenly duplicate itself an insane amount of infinite times for every single possibility that can occur especially when you consider that even just a simple act of moving your arm has infinite possibility of how you would move it. if you look into the many worlds theory just a few layers deeper you would see how it wouldn't make any physical sense for the universe to function this way
Who is lost
10:29 tgat looks like a moth hanging from a tree branch
ü§Ø my brain hurts a little
So, she's can talk with other versions of herself across the multiverse to keep herself alive? Makes Sense
Du a ebesod on skyland
15:45 I'VE PAINTED THAT PARK!!
So, what if we take other theories in account for Wraith's powers?  Are there any possible theories that explain her power better than the many worlds one? String theory can't be it... quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle has ruined my life with its uncertainty...
Wait so wraith has a Navi inside her head?
yeah wraith is the strongest legend but that doesnt mean bloodhound  doesnt need to be nerfed
What I do when I hear Austin......
1. get ear bleeding because he yells all the time without reason
2. watch another video
Great video but its called Voices From The Void for a reason
From one Auston to another, thank you.
if the many worlds thery is true and every possible thing that could happen WILL happen, then someonw that wants to destroy all worlds would appear, succed and fail? but how can he destroy all existence and not do that at the same time?
 wouldnt this create a branch where the big boss villain would suceed and one where he would not, which would create another timeline where he would succed to destroy the two before and then another where AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY HEAD
If she chooses ANY possibility then wouldn‚Äôt she choose the outcome of her finding about her past? üßêü§î
I‚Äôve seen Wraith die before tho
Dude forget this Austin! Who is the richest video game character!
my man i love u
steve could destroy them all
MAYBE I‚ÄôLL BE TRACER
so she would be in effect a transplanar hivemind
Because she can go as fast as sound.
Im sure this was worked out a while ago but whatever, in simple wraiths that died in other universes warn the one that may die to try and keep one alive.
Was.. wasn't this called something else around 1 ish?
Her warpy ability takes her temporarily away from her own reality. That's why everyone else disappears and you see random glimpses of people that aren't/won't be there
AY #14 trendingg
Dear person who edited this video and added all the eyebrows, texts and what not,

Why is Erwin Schr√∂dinger saying 'verdorie' ? Verdorie is not an Austrian word nor English word, and I'm not certain how well Erwin's Dutch is.

If by chance this was a nudge to the Dutch, I would like to know what that nudge is. Or if you have an employee who speaks Dutch or has some connection to the Dutch, can you hook me up? Would love to meet some more Dutch people up in here.

Sincerely,

What happened to Matpat??
Austin I was thinking about your Tracer video for like 3 minutes and   I think you were thinking about it wrong what if shes not geting the stats of the past but the stats of the future ok I know what you're thinking whos ganna read this and the Tracer video was like 500 years ago but I dont give any craps about that anywho so what if her accelerator actually records her position and the only valid position she can go back to was 10 seconds ago and forward. and eveytime she jumps through time it stores data on the condition she was in or would of been in if she hadn't jumped so when she recoiled it would revers her momentome and the movements she made up to 10 seconds while accelerating her healing with data it had on her heath but do to the reversal of 10 seconds it can only accelerat her healing to the state she was in 10 seconds before which would explain why time only seems to move back for her shes not going back its only making it seem like she is and the reason it puts her back like thats is becuse it would most generally be safer their than where she was so please tell me if you read this or found it interesting 

sincerely,
Crazy
Ok fr tho, how many of the very few modern theatre fans watching this freaked out when Austin said ‚ÄúApex Predator‚Äù?
I love the backgroundmusic 
Who made dis
this is why i left science its so depressing cause you realize nothing matters life death god
Pretty sure this is how Elizabeth  from bioshock infinites powers work too,  talk about killing two birds with one stone.
she would have quantum immortality.
Powerful bi energy
Thank you bro
that's a rather unfortunate existance
No austin just matt
Sry not to hate or anything, awesome theory! but if there were multiple Wraith's from different demensions communicating shouldn't one have found out already, assuming that one of a infinite amount of them found out, shouldn't every single one know by now?
So basically the most brilliant kinds of the world determine the location of particles in the same way I explain to my parents over the phone where an object they need that I last saw is? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs...somewhere in my room... pretty sure...‚Äù
Can u guys do a theory on octane???    I worry the shots he injects himself with aren‚Äôt healthy
Okay....Wraith is now both terrifying and someone to feel sorry for so much that words can't give justice to. Knowing she's dying in other realities all the time, and that some of her others only purpose in life is to die and warn the other Wraiths of that specific death.....it's horrible. But also kind of cool and poetic in a sad and morbid way.
But when I played for the first time she was the first one I popped...
Why did the name get changed to the video??
surprised Austin didn't mention how the phase walking ability was invented in titan fall 2. In the campaign you see how the original tech was made and when you first use it the character is shown jumping between points in time (one point being an active battle for the facility the other the aftermath of its destruction). being that you phase into the same ethereal black and white realm in titan fall as you do in apex it stands to reason that it is the same tech with likely the same origins (shifting points in time). fact that apex is supposed to be in the same game world as titan fall makes this a pretty solid slam dunk in my opinion.
Hey hey were da fak is my richest video game character do u want to be cremated on laundry machine that a time machine in dile set to random
saw the annoying dog in the undertale bit
Close - Apex Legends takes place 30 years after Titanfall 2
why doesnt she ask one of her other selves what happend to her ?
Assuming we could include the respawn mechanic as part of Wraith's unconscious power, would it make sense that every single time you respawned you were actually just in a split world created by Wraiths decision?
Jojo Fans:
Wraith is Funny Valentine and uses D4C!!
Knew you would make a video on apex and especially on Wraith
Great video but I‚Äôm mad he dropped a wingman for a re-45
and thats why people pick wraith
Lol I main Mirage üòÇ
Madman explains how King Crimson works
Bro...that music that starts at 5:04 and the other music that starts at 13:07 is amazing. What is it??
Hmmm where'd the clickbait thumbnail go?
Sounds like Steins; Gate
How does the reviving work in the game? Clones? Please do a video.
Thanks for increasing the amount of underaged rage quitters that ruin our team before we evendrop all because they can't be wraith.
2k my dude, 2k.
There's something about a character being warned by her other self in a different world before they died. I am fascinated with stories such as these.
5:06 - what game is that ?
now i cant chose anything else than wraith
What if her many worlds theory. Is just parallel not completely perpendicular to the next. Cause it's more than likely that any probable outcome in which the current Wraith takes. The parallel Wraiths follow to save the next.
What a great message
By judging the past of the gumba,the bottle,poison and the other environment you can find the outcome like if the bottle was weak or if the gumba was so dumb that it will drink it.
btw austin is bisex
So to qoute from Zero Escape: "Wraith is a SHIFTer"
This was Nicholas Cage's ability in Next.
I notice how you changed the thumbnail and title. Sneaky move.
Your theory about the dimensions is true because the respawn themselves said the same in the WIRED video
How about this what could the bliss from far cry 5 most likely be?
Add wraith's pick rate to the theory and you've got the exact number of wraith's
I honestly thought it was going to be,"sincerely Ali a"
Austin was the host of the video because matpat is already crying about the fnaf VR game because possibly of its many secrets hidden in the teaser's and the game itself
I like that pep talk you gave at the end.
You've been bamboozled!
cataracts intensifies
Wait..... But....... Who's the richest.
Austin: "I think what's lost on a lot of people is just how complicated the many worlds theory actually is if you take it as true"

I appreciate this statement so much, lol.  It's not just like... "you did this, or you did that" because every world spawns another world which each spawns their own worlds which each spawn their own worlds and this is exponential growth at an alarming rate for every occurrence point of deviation that could possibly occur, and when does it start?  does it start now or did it start millions of years ago and if so is there another deviation for every major event?  or every minor event? in society, or for each and every persons life?  or perhaps for every superposition of every molecule at any given fraction of a second in time for every such fraction of a second since time began?  The literal definition of Infinite.  Not just unfathomably large but growing at a rate of unfathomably large to the power of unfathomably large to the power of unfathomably large, faster than I can type "unfathomably large" lol.

That is to say, everything that has happened hasn't happened, everything that hasn't happened has happened and everything that will happen both won't happen and has already happened.  So what's real?  Nothing, everything, and only exactly what you want to believe.
Why did the title change

You some type of gay?
I hate this guy
More apex
sis... head and shoulders...
what song is it that starts at 5:05  and end  8:00 ??????????
Plz help
I take way too much joy in the fact that this is my first exposure to this game, outside hearing its name.

I mean that legitimately. I am not proud of the joy I take in this. I have a problem.
Well now I just feel bad.
Because I‚Äôve chosen to click on your awesome videos it means the other Daniel‚Äôs will miss out and not click on them. ü•∫üíî
do I exist...probably ;)
When wraith phase shifts. The shadowy figures you see dissapearing and appering, are actually Wraith herself. Phasing at exactly the same time. In a different dimension.
President Valentine taught me about the many worlds theory
austin will have fun with warframe's powers
This one got remarkably cheerful there at the end :)
2:00 .... so basically a game theory but with this guy... idk I think this is much better than constantly screaming about  flaws
I‚Äôve always found the implications of the Many Worlds theory comforting. As bad as this version or consciousness of me might end up, another version of me is crushing it and this version of me will always have the potential to excel and be in good situations as well. The world(s) just opens up.

It‚Äôs a very simplistic view of such a complex and unproven theory but I do find it... comforting.
2:42 
Lol mirage
I miss when you made good content
This is my favorite the science video
Cover darkwood
I have some problems with this. 

I know your goal is to make Ôº° game educational and explain what is going on in Ôº° fun way without boring the ∆ßhit , but I feel like wraith‚Äôs power is like spidee sense combined with some sort of experimental LSD ∆ßhit but yea just my opinion
2:28 wait no that sounds really cool hang on
Thanks Austin!
I don't often leave comments on videos on youtube mostly because the comment sections tend to be nightmares but Austin I just wanted to say, thank you for making these videos. Every video on Game Theory is amazing but I especially love yours, you interest me in science in ways high school and college never could. This video was especially interesting and you know, the message at the end of the video meant a lot. We are all rooting for you too.
off topic but i can‚Äôt wait for Dungeon Defenders: Awakened. they just passed their kickstarter goal and have like 2 weeks left.
5:05 Name of the song?
Another thing to re enforce your idea of having a many world theory is in her ability of wraith mode or whatever it‚Äôs called in that she enters into a (as I‚Äôm gonna call it a wraith realm). In this realm she cannot be hurt and she cannot physically affect the world around her.  And in that you see humanoid good looking figures running around In random positions what if those are the other wraith‚Äôs from other worlds where she sees where her other selves have been and she can choose where she wants to go to better herself in the game.  Just a thought
What a great video üíñ so shes basiclly way more OP than a lot of anime characters without even trying üëÄ wow
Well bloodhound instead of secretly talking to his own pararlel 
He let them talk to every one else
Currently at a bad roadblock, thanks for rooting for me!
ally across time/ army across time from dnd pathfinder
I just knew there was gonna be an apex legends theory.
15:55 Drops a Wingman for a RE-45... WHAT... the HELL... are you DOING!?
Mirage is DUMMY THICC
....okay, this is cool and all...but who‚Äôs the richest video game character ever?
Hey Austin, you should check out "qualia of the purple" its a manga that fits this so well
That's  kinda interesting, it's like she has bunch of shadow clones but in different realities
Is it sad that i was taught the many worlds theory from rick and morty?
Bloodhound is the best
I didn't know Austin was gay.
Millions of different  universes that are almost the exact same sounds like Marvel Universes
WE NEED A PATHFINDERS CREATOR/ORIGIN THEORY!
Bioshock infinite.
Where's Matpat
Wait, If wraith can communicate to her alternate selves about being shot then could her alternate selves warn her before getting shot so that she wouldn‚Äôt get shot in the first place...
Your explanations were pretty good, but the problem I see with your ‚Äúmultiple wraiths‚Äù theory is that it implies that the wraiths advising our wraith have already experienced what our wraith is about to experience. This would mean that the multiverse‚Äôs other universe exists further along in time than ours does, and quantum superposition does not accelerate or slow time in some universes but not others. What you are claiming is the same as saying if a researcher watching Schrodinger‚Äôs cat was able to communicate with his other selves, his other selves would be able to tell him whether or not the poison was released before he saw the inside of the box, which is impossible because time in the multiverse still runs parallel. Even if a researcher opens the box and tells another, parallel researcher who is waiting to open his box that his cat is either dead or alive, the chances of the waiting researcher‚Äôs cat being either dead or alive remain the same. By that same logic, wraith‚Äôs parallels would be unable to tell her that she was going to be shot at before she was shot at the exact same point in time in multiple universes, and one wraith getting shot in one multiverse at a certain point in time does not increase another wraith‚Äôs chance of getting shot 5 seconds later.
But all the universes happen at the same time right? If all the possibilities happen at the same time, how is able to predict future for her other self?
When I first started playing Apex Legends, I was obsessed with Wraith. I am also a theorist member( technically) and I was trying to explore her story a bit further. Thank you for dropping this video because now I can use it like a reference. I like how u explained her state of mind with her condition, something I was unable to piece together.
Where‚Äôs the math of science!!! AUSTIN MAKE SCIENCE
The johnny depp on fear and loathing in las vegas in the psychodelic vortex is awesome.
I always love when stories do that sort of thing.  One of the most powerful moments in stories is when that kind of character comes up against a threat, and loses in all of the timelines.
actually, it's just [Epitaph]
What's the song playing in the final speech before Mirage shows up?
about the mirage thing, i honestly agree with austin, but not that much of a degree.
Wraith is a stand user and her stand is D4C theory done
Scott lang and wraith will be a perfect duo
like her consciousness is the more optimistic one but she is still in her own imperfect world with the help of similar worlds, she's like the rickest rick
So Nikolas Cage "Next," basically?
yeah but like where's the giant science rant at the end austin i'm starting to miss them a bit lol
What's the name of the song playing at 5:05
MIIRAAAGGEE
Is it weird that I knew all of that already? Still a damn good video though. Only lacks a bit of yelling.
why is this video about the science of a video game character better at helping me through life than any of my friends and parents....
I mean, it doesn't matter what she is choosing to do per tick, but that she is in that location. Only location choices matter to Wraith's voices, not reloading, holding fists, or getting ready to throw an ordinance. If that were so, she would get a lot more voices telling her to pull her gun out, reloading her weapon, heal up, throw an ordinance, etc.
You explained schr√∂dingers box wrong
So is just D4C
Auistin+Mirage
whos jack and finally some lore on Apex
I and my girlfriend played super smash flash 2 on tSupersmashflash2beta and then we broke up!!!
Here's a question that I don't think anyone has an answer to but it's fun to ask: assuming you have a 50/50 chance of finding either a dead or a live goombah and you did the experiment ten times in a row using only one goombah without replacing it if it died in any of the ten trials, then from an outsiders perspective, shouldn't you end up with one live goombah and ten dead ones?

Here's why:
Experiment 1 results: 1 live, 1 dead (Total: 1 live, 1 dead)
Experiment 2 results: 1 live recycled goombah, 1 unlucky recycled goombah, plus one dead goombah from last time (Total 1 live, 2 dead)
Experiment 3 results: 1 live recycled goombah, 1 more unlucky recycled goombah, plus two leftover dead goombahs (Total: 1 live, 3 dead).
Wait, aint that speed o' sound sonic?
I missed you Austin your better than mattpatt
Wraith sounds like Ghost from Ant Man and the Wasp.
Wow, applause to you Austin.
Sincerely, a random viewer
Wait Jack? Nonononoononoo, Wraith is a Tenno from Warframe.
but how is talking to yourself from another dimension more likely than just sensing a trap or sniper?
So is time travel just going to a different timeline?
15:55 how the hell are you gonna grab an RE-45 over a wingman?
gets epic ad
Only real ones know that the title and thumbnail were changed.
Oh i thought it was gonna be matpat
anyone noticed the thumbnail and the title got changedüòÇ
did a video on Ray hasnt done a video on Shulk
Where is matpat
Why‚Äôd they change the thumbnail
So basically she has the time stone
Austin, have you watched Steins;Gate?  lol
#10 on trending for gaming
Wasn't the original title or thumbnail, what is going on??
Wow who's here before he change title and thumbnail
Hey Austin. Just wanted to comment and say that I really appreciate your reference to eyes on the inside.
I was wondering where you had been for the last three weeks well this video was good so I guess it was worth it
New theory ,,, why Austin takes over Gametheory everyonce in a while,,,, answer Matpat is taking a break
I love austin üòÇ
Science the crap out of Titian fall
no how about you cover how her invulnerability state works.... because it's not teleporting. it's a state that brings her out of the current enviornment to avoid a hazard. usually in the form of gunfire and grenades. my guess is it revolves around dimension hopping. an ethereal plane that gets her out of the way. of harm. with that i bid you adieu austin. and good luck.
Did the Thumbnail Change?
why did they change the title and thumbnail?
This was a weird guide
austin gey
So, she‚Äôs a god.
Soma
WHY DOES THIS GUY ALWAYS SOUND LIKE SHE IS SHOUTING AT ME!
Does anyone else think the reason Wraith supposedly has amnesia is because her brain is so constantly overwhelmed by the amount of information collected by her parallel selves that her brain cannot physically take the stress?
Does anyone else think the reason Wraith supposedly has amnesia is because her brain is so constantly overwhelmed by the amount of information collected by her parallel selves that her brain cannot physically take the stress?
8:10 any else think this gun reminds them of halo
That transition at around 8:07 was really good, I had to say it
Ah, the wonderful, overwhelming complexity that is the multiverse.
Better example watch Antman and the wasp and you‚Äôll know all about quantum physics
If that theory is correct then 
Somewhere in an alternate reality EA is the best developers in the world and everyone knows it. Only if 






And somewhere Nintendo is a money hungry company that doesn‚Äôt care about the games just the profit
YEAH! Austin!!!

YOUTUBE HAS SHOWN ME THIS SAME VIDEO 3 TIMES, ALL WITH DIFFERENT THUMBNAILS AND TITLES!
Dear, Austin. Finish the richest video game character series, please.
Do dead by daylight
Oh no it's AUSTIN
am i the only one thinking of aradia?
Does chaos theory coinside with the many worlds theory?
Why did the icon change (i forgot what the small picture is called that's why i said icon).
Seems legit
Simple: she has the rennigan and the sharingan (she wears contacts to block them)
There is the idea that--if Many Worlds Theory is true--everyone is near-immortal from his own point of view.  Every time you are in a life-or-death situation, in some realities you die, and in others you live.  If there is any chance--no matter how small--of surviving, there will be a reality in which you do survive, and that is the one you will be aware of.  You will continue to live in one reality or another until you are in a situation in which the chance for survival is truly zero.
So what you're saying is, wraith is GOD DAM TERRIFYING.
eyyyy
IT IS MY BIRTHDAY  and i don't like austen
Someone one please tell me the name of the sax song at the end!!!!!
And I also found that 2^30 is 1million not 2million
6:35  What did Gaijin Goomba ever do to you?!
Austin is  ((G A Y)) confirmed
Did you not like the first thumbnail?
Hey, you didn't rage this time
Yea but I have a legendary banner and epic pose
So she's Funny Valentine with Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
oooof, what the name of that epic sax song at the end.
I wonder how many times I liked this video
1:55 is a pintagram
the tital changed
If that thaery is true is ther inuf space for the other Univers ?
27th...honestly I like Apex more than Fortnite
Theory ideas for MatPat or Austin; 
1 Is Joy from We Happy Few possible to be made in real life?
2 what happens if one takes two or three pills at once in real life?
Yes she can lose, I suck
A mother  PSI episode
Apex lag is real too real
What's with the Title and main pic change?
Did anyone see the thumbnail and title change?
The problem with the Many Worlds theory as presented here and in many other places, it that it neglects the fact that all the matter in the universe already exists, and all that changes is the state in which it's in, so it's less a branching path, and more a lattice of possibilities, which can, under certain conditions, intersect.
WHO TF IS THIS I WANT MAT PAT THIS   GUY CAN GO ON HIS OWN CHANNEL
So, you do a theory for Apex Legends but you won‚Äôt do a theory for Titanfall 1 or 2. Oküëåüèæ
So Wraith basically experiences an isekai every time she dies? Lit
WHOS READY FOR TITAN FALL 3
you should do a vid on jim pickens
Do a Hollow knight theory plisss
im having an existenil crisis and am crying
Can we get a theory on Titanfall 2
I love game theory but I don't like listening to him queer over another dude
So you are telling me that the other 50% is not random crashes
If you played titanfall 2 then you would have saw at the end they leaked the name of apex
Well that would explain why she went insane if you have thousands upon thousands of voices screaming in pain or just talking in general the stress on your head would most likely kill you or drive you into a vegitive state
Gaypex legends
Austin you suss?
Kinda like king crimson
Okay wraith has a pretty badass super power.
Where's matpat
Sooo... D4C Anyone?
Could you please do a theory on how many safety regulations Wonder Park is breaking
Where's Matt Pat
Doctor Strange? Hello!?
Nobody:
Austin: HI! ITS ME!
It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that whether not only does the other wraiths communicate with other wraiths, it ONLY communicates with the specific wraiths that the relevant danger applies to. If she didn‚Äôt, you constantly hear wraith saying ‚Äúyour being aimed at‚Äù. This means that wraith has the ability to control which specific timelines to warn about the incoming threat. 

Sincerely, Eric
Austin is surprisingly calm (relatively) in this video
Mirage is Funny Valentine using D4C
Good vid bad game formatting
Really cause she does when Im playing
Since we can't see gravity, but we can see the effects it causes, then what else can we see the effects of? Like for instance, what if the speeding up of the expansion of the universe is from the amount of alternate realities being created all the time?
You could‚Äôve just played and talked about titan fall 2..
I don‚Äôt know if my phone is messed up, but the thumbnail seems to constantly be changing between two options every time it is not on my screen. I don‚Äôt know if that was intentional, or my brain has exploded from this episode and I‚Äôm seeing multiple possibilities for thumbnails.


I‚Äôm going insane
More Austin videos please
Anyone else think she looks like speed o sound sonic from one punch man visually
why did this get changed from a mostly dumb name into a super clickbait name?
Who hasn't seen the movie Next it's kinda the same thing.
Except taxes and death.
If your gonna look at apex lore you have to look at titanfall lore
I‚Äôd love to connect this to the number of matches any player has ever joined as wraith, witch probably has to be millions at this point.
thats 2^8 and thats 256 not 512
I like the fact that you used Goombas instead of cats for the box quantum physics theory. That was pretty cool. 

Also are you Bisexual? Had to ask because of 16:17.
I never expected Austin to be the bisexual icon we all deserve
I thought this vidwo used to be called how she can pedict te futher
Isn't the background music song about river called Vltava from Bed≈ôich Smetana?

Funny how a video about alternate universes has a different thumbnail, as if to say the other thumbnail is real but in an alternate universe
Diverging world lines!?!?! This must be the work of sern! El psy kongroo....
Ow come on Austin sting thory is not that compilation nor is faszeing inrelashion to it at least on a consapule level. The level you would need for a you tube video.
That'd be a lot of me...
I like it...
The your age can be found out by complex dna test or even an X-ray.ya you will not get the extract yaer but you can till if some one ages with in about ten yaers made even with in 7 if your real good.
It would be cool if every time you died as wraith, you get a better chance to be told your getting shot at, or something like that.
This dude got hella dandruff
What I learned from this is don't let the blue shell slow you down üê¢
Is this the same Austin from shoddy cast
Apex Legend's lore sounds a lot like the plot of the Hunger Games.
I support them <3
Wait but if wraith's ability is to be warned by her other selves of being shot at, but is also communicating with herself in real time, how does she know that she's going to be shot at if it hasn't happened yet? is "real time" not a standardized time in which all timelines are happening simultaneously?
Who are you üßêüßê
What‚Äôs crazy to think about is that if it‚Äôs true that means infinite dimensions already discovered dimensional travel and there‚Äôs and infinite chance of them coming to our timeline and telling us but there also isn‚Äôt at the same time, shits crazy man
I just love your video
RIP matt patt
just stop
Wraith is now in my top 10 video game characters for this concept. My mind is blown!
Looks like Jack-O-Lantern Panic. I mean Speed O Sound Sonic.
You know the strongest legend gotta be Saitama
austin i feel like youre not being called weird about how you love mirage so much because we all do
I was not prepared for that much optimism, much appricated
Looking at myself as part if a team instead of someone redundant and insignificant... I never thought of it like that.
The universes were never made, they always existed.
So with the idea of being able to send energy to alternate worlds, theoretically we could all end up in some multi-universal dictatorship because one universe decided to start sucking energy out of ours. ((I mean I can't be sure but its probably theoretically possible. Please note that I don't know, its just a thought that popped into my head, I'm no physicist, I'm a high-schooler.))
Rip BT-7274
Austin, your wife and child are temporary, mirage is eternal
Wait if the many worlds theory is real shouldn't she be able to hear some form of herself that didn't go the same path she did, like before the IMC? Shouldn't she be able to already know her past?
i do not think she have ALL of those "last thoughts" flowing trough her head. many "similar" ones will overlap and make it detectable to the ones who is closer in the probability branch while the ones farther will get other message if they occur often enough. (one million whispers becoming as loud as a scream!)
Wow Wraiths powers from that perspective sounds amazing but also really sad because you'd be talking to your friends and suddenly hearing several gunshots and wondering where it came from and then a "Look out!" Wouldn't that get annoying? Also I get that Austin likes Mirage but you don't need to go that far GODDAMN!
I feel so bad for Gaijin Goombah. He died so many times in this video.
Where can I get that sick song that starts at about 5:20?
Did anyone else think mirage's pants look like sauna pants
Does Mat not go these anymore?
Take this down before they nerf her
This is why I am a wraith main( good point on the different wraiths thing)
Put simply: Wraith is Multiverse Dude Perfect
This felt like early Matpat and I love it.
A nice introduction to the multiverse theory, which I love.
Got a fortnite ad before a vid about apex lmao
Wow Austin you did not scream alot in this video.
Can we just talk about the Mirage parts üëå
Not picking timelines, probably forging would be a better term. Also to calculate that quintillion number is silly because a lot of choices can overlap and lead to the same conclusion. And you are running into Libertarian Free Will with the time traveling information.
I'm watching this video 7 hours after this video was created but I saw the thumbnail 5 hours ago
Am I the only ones that is constantly telling at Fortnite but have never had a problem with Apex
N o h ¬£ m o
Wraith cannot lose? Since when? I only play wraith and have never once won.

Also if I can't play wraith then I leave the game. Also she's not psychic, shes a voidwalker
i dont believe it they cover apex
Also, Bloodhound calls himself ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúwe are one.‚Äù Is this like wraith but all of the different bloodhounds can control one carcass at once? This would be like Ermac from Mortal Kombat X.
Where is matpat
What the Mirrage is that about?!
Wraith can lose to bloodhound any day all he has to do is scan and it will tell you what wrath is doing and her tactical sucks you can see her with or without bloodhounds ability‚Äôs.
Austin, you love this, I love this. PLAY THE ZERO ESCAPE SERIES. Also Rupert Sheldrake published a paper on a concept called Morphogenetic Resonance, where-in multiple selves are able to communicate across timelines through the Morphogenetic field. Pretty cool fringe science and the Zero Escape series has a whole lot more than just that. Do it, you won't.
After spending a gross ampunt of time in homestuck this is very understandable
yeet
The only problem with this concept is she is getting more information than her brain could process in a lifetime in fractions of a second. So the thought she could parse anything useful out of it is insane. MAYBE she can get enough of a glimpse of a small enough of a subsection to use pure instinct to make something happen. Anything beyond that would take a leap of evolution so massive it would make our transition from single-celled organisms to humanity look trivial. She is actually using G-D level thought speed to comprehend the universe. No wonder she can't remember anything.
Considering the parallels between Elsa and Riku, Sora actually helping her overcome her inner darkness the way this theory describes would make a lot of sense considering the game's themes
And mat pat wonders why Disney won‚Äôt sponsor him again
This would explain why Elsa never joins your party either...
Disney missed an excellent opportunity to add depth to their best-selling character. Shame.
Disney: okay we need to censor it
Matpat: eLsA WaS oRgiNalLy tHe VilLaIn
Disney: .
Oh my god I SHOULD HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT MYSELF I literally said while I was playing through the ice labyrinth, 'how on earth did Larxene make this? it looks exactly like Elsa's ice architecture? this makes no sense??' and when I approached the ice palace later on, I said 'why on EARTH can't i explore the palace?? that is literally the one thing i was looking forward to'. But hearing you piece all this together, it just... makes SO MUCH SENSE.
Not to mention how Elsa always saw herself as a cough cough



LONE!!!!!





WOLF!!!!!
I love this theory.  I wish they wouldn't have intervened so badly.  This version of the story would have been much more appreciated.
WAIT..... that last 0.1 from 2.9 IS THE ARENDELLE LEVEL COMPLETED!
Matpat: No backstory required.
A literal 15 seconds later
Matpat: Let me quickly catch you up.

EDIT: Oh shoot he tricked me.
Not to mention Larxene has always only ever had power over lighting, not ice. Ice also poorly conducts electricity, so you can't say it's because of that.
This is too good. I‚Äôm now accepting this theory as Canon and rejecting the actual game level.
I do recall there being a prototype screen shot where Elsa has a darkness around her as if she was giving in or under a spell. I could totally see this theory being valid.
Plot twist: What if this WASN'T the plan and The Game Theorists just made up a better story with the same ingredients? LMAO
I'm choosing to believe this because it sounds like something Disney would do and the team behind Kingdom Hearts, for as convoluted as they are, has never been that sloppy
It took my husband so long to finish this level due to how boring and disjointed it is. I'm on board with this theory!
I dunno about you guys, but I'm loving this insane Mickey.
I believe it. Would be great if they would make a KH 3 Final Mix and put back in all content that was taken out.
If Tetsuya Nomura and Hideo Kojima ever team up to make a game I firmly believe the world may implode and collapse into itself like a neutron star.
The last game theory with photoshop matpat instead of video matpat...
Man, I miss this format in gt...
Top ten anime rivals:
MatPat vs Mickey Mouse
I watched this theory 3 times now and no matter how I think about it this theory seems more on point than it sounds, I know a lot of people like finding faults and mistakes in mats theories for reasons, but honestly it makes a lot of sense especially that labyrinth part.
Stop giving mat a hard time (you know who you are) he‚Äôs not calling them game facts it‚Äôs theories.
I'm not sure that Elsa was definitely the villain but the ice palace was DEFINITELY swapped and she definitely had a different role to begin with.  I feel like SO much of the game was edited late on for the worse - gladly I still loved the game.
Disney,Hey PUT THESE SONGS IN RIGHT NOW 

Square enix, but we ship tomorrow
Sir to do that we need more ti

Disney, I DON'T CARE PUT EM IN RIGHT NOW AND PUT HANS AS THE MAIN VILLIAN 
WE DON'T NEED TO BE SUED FOR STRESS AND WRONGFUL CHILD DEATH 
Square enix,yes sir right away sir
It's sad to think about. That story would in a way fall in line with the movie yet be "original" at the same time. The entire movie Else is figuring out if she's cold like her powers or if she can do more and be more/better. From what this theory goes into it would of felt like an actual Kingdom Hearts world. They missed out on so many good story opportunities. The fact too they cut characters bc they had enough original characters. The selling point of the game was the combination of the two franchises. As much as I love Disney's movies and shows, when it comes to them partnering up it just doesn't go well.
This is a theory you just KNOW is 100% true. It is just so painfully obvious. Disney and their meddling knows no bounds.
Thwarting art in the name of playing it safe can be helpful in certain cases, but allowing people to create new stories out of the things you create is how people continue to invest in and enjoy said things.

Elsa choosing evil and being later saved makes absolute sense, and was established as a possibility in the movie- it's far more powerful a story to see someone conflicted choose an evil path, then make the choice towards bettering themselves, than just skip straight to being good.

Edit: Kingdom Hearts 3 Arendel Patch for the original level. Sign the petition
"The Frozen world was originally something completely different"

"FBI OPEN UP!"
best level ever too bad Disney is basically alcohol smugglers during the prohibition era
Organization 13?
Article 13? 
Coincidence? I THINK NOT! But thats just a theory. A GAME Theory.
2015: "The Disney teams are helping out with the game? AMAZING!!!" 

2019: "Uh, maybe that wasn't such a good idea after all."
theoretically, with a lot of work, would someone be able to mod the original level in?
On top of everything else, there's one piece of KH lore that makes this even more plausible: Larxene specializes in lightning magic, not ice.
This not only makes a little bit of sense it make 100% sense
personally i think they should've axed all of arandelle and went with a Brave world, that movie was so much better, and it fits sora's universe better
Matpat's grand children be like:
Grandpa, we need to interview someone so what was your job?
Matpat: i got bullied by a cartoon mouse.
Ovophobia: The fear of cracking eggs
i guess disney should have let it go



see what did thereüòã
I was actually very impressed with this video MatPat.  Good job from you and the team.
I still have flashbacks of the beginning song from kingdom hearts. üòÇüíú
I love how your making fun of Micky mouse while I‚Äôm drawing micky mouse and Kermit
Wait there‚Äôs a cooking mini game?
*Flashback* Shivering
TL;DR of this video:
MatPat: "Is Elsa Good or Bad?"
Disney: "yesn't"
Damn seeing this made me want to play Kingdom Hearts 3 (2.9), but then I quickly realised this version wouldn't be in it. üòìüò¢
This theory makes me sad and angry. I would've LOVED to play your version of Arendelle, MatPat! T_T Thanks alot, Disney...
Mickey (in this video): laughs
Me: hi ryder (footofaferret)
Metaphorically hans was a wolf with his pack of nobels hunting for control of arendel.
Ah god please not you to matpat golem is pronounced go-lem not gollum, please they are 2 very different things
this sounds more like MatPat had some insider information XD
This. This may be one of your best theories ever and I accept it as fact. I thought I was the only one who was confused by the Frozen world!
The Olympus level is the intro/tutorial so they made it 2.9 the rest is the 3rd game
You know what, I would have loved to play that version of Arendelle.
It was such a boring and underdone world, and that plot would've made it infinitely better.
Thanks a lot, Disney.
matpat i love you but we didn't need that 1:00 intro..
kingdom hearts 2.9 you say almost if its unfinished
Normally I find your theories to be a stretch, but I actually think you are right this time
Can we speak about how donald and goofy aren't out of place in the WHOLE KH universe? Like.... it's legit one thing that bothers me. (And to be more specific, worlds where there's only humans and not any humanoid creatures. i.e. big hero six.)
So in other words, Disney always finds a way to screw up good story telling.
This would've been a better story than the actual movie! XD
18:41, MatPat, you had a chance to say, " sometimes it's best to just let it go"
Theory canon accepted. Makes so much more sense now.
Why does Matpat hate Mickey Mouse so much?
Before KH3 came out I spent a week catching up on the lore. All I know is you gotta Nort a boy
I feel like micky mouse is going more insane than Jeff the killer
A real shame... I honestly think your theory is right. This would have made the world infinitely better, even if we still had to deal with the songs.
Does anyone know how to unlock the ultima weapon keyblade?
Gah I wish this game theory was the real level
It does sound like a really cool story. If that was what they actually put into the game, I would be very tempted to buy it.
When will he do another vid on kingdom hearts
2015: "The Disney teams are helping out with the game? AMAZING!!!" 


2019: "Uh, maybe that wasn't such a good idea after all."
Why do i have a feeling Matt actually explained the whole plot and then decided it was way to long and cut it into that
im so disappointed in you, the final mix version is not out yet you u know ;)
When you came to this video because of the endcard on the FIlm Theory, but he tells you to watch that video at the end of this one, and getting to the end of that one, he directs you once again to this one, thus renewing the cycle and continuing the loop
Welp... Paradoxes.
Mat Pat's level would have been 200x better than what we got.
I actually think "Dark Elsa" would be an even more compelling role model for girls than the clean Disney version because it shows that girls can be whoever they want to be and that their actions have consequences that can do a lot of damage both to themselves and others if they act recklessly or with hostility.


Life is full of good, bad, and gray, and they should see how their choices can decide that ending.
thank you matt. the ENTIRE GAME seems to have missing threads all over :/
Honestly this makes me mad at Disney...because this would have made this world SOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER
Why was the intro so random? üòÇüòÇ
It's to bad that you actually have to go through that level just to complete the game! üòÜüòÑüòÅüëç

They actually should have made Elsa a villain! üòÑüòÅüëç
This isn't JUST A THEORY, ITS A DAMN FACT
shouldn't you credit your mickey mouse voice actor? the others sounded like in-game clips, but mickey obviously wasn't.

plus, well, they sound more like the mickey from the previous games. they should get credit for being better.
also factor in that they lost a whole year switching to Unreal 4 engine because the Luminous Dev team were still on FFXV
I never played kingdom hearts, but that's a kick-arse boss.
There's also the fact that uh...there's a decent amount of fanart that gives Elsa a wolf form or is represented by a wolf. And always a white wolf. Even long before KH3. But that's a coincidental stretch. Maybe.
Congratulations you are now in charge of Kingdom Hearts 3 Final Mix.
I'm just now remembering I was completely turned off when they put let it go into the game. I didn't want it after that, but would have played that level on mute.
Mat pat :
Skill:really smart
Weak to:breaking eggs
I thought I was nuts and you legit confirmed all my theories
Man, the original level would've been SO MUCH BETTER
having Elsa transform into a wolf also kind of makes sense if you take the expression of a lone wolf

Elsa tries to be alone and keep everybody away, just like a lone wolf would do
I suppose that's why for the next KH series, Tetsuya Nomura will be using his own work (The World Ends with You, Verum Rex), so that he has full creative control.
OR MAYBE IT WAS KRISTOFF BC HE WAS WORKING WITH ICE FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE
Today every one will know an Disney will admit THY done goof-y üòÇ.....üòÖ now it make more sense on the level I mean that electric mix ice power is so NOT accurate next time Disney need to let kingdom hearts do it's own thing üòâ we glad we have you matpat!
<edited> AN NEED A DLC TO MAKE ELISA TO BE THE ONE THAT CREATE THE ICE WOLF.....or update an dlc of a hidden true story of the frozen story level of kh3/2.9 with out Disney interuping it besides matpat an other theorist know the truth of it an every one following it üòá..... yes "let it go" Disney your movie an the ice princess is exposed to be the final boss üòà
‚ÄúShe could fall into despair‚Äù
Cough cough danganronpa
Matt throwing out videos even when his house is falling apart. Thank you Matt, we seriously do appreciate it and if you ever do need a break, take one‚ù§Ô∏èüíö
i love kingdom hearts 3 i also love matpat but more also my dad hated the cooking minigame XD 
edit:nothing beats scott bro I MEAN NOTHING!
Me, getting mad that Matpat didn‚Äôt mention Journey when talking about blizzards blowing you down mountains.  It is literally SO similar that it hurts!!!
honestly, disney... let‚Äôs talk about the songs. would it have been so hard to just have the composer use the melodies as a motif in arendelle‚Äôs background music? it would‚Äôve been more subtle and organic, and it wouldn‚Äôt have made me skip arendelle‚Äôs cutscenes.
As a part of game theorist community, I suggest that we should force Disney to bring back that game level. If we managed to change Sonic image from that disaster, I'm sure we could bring back that deleted part of Kingdom Hearts as well.
#bringbackelsa
Who's in?
Matpat's ongoing battle with mickey mouse is honestly knocking my socks off
I hated Arendelle THEY ADDED THE WHOLE FREAKING LET IT GO SONG ! I didn't Know if I should've skipped the scene cause I didn't know  if there was VALUABLE INFO ! I finished the game long ago but im Still pissed . But props to nomura for the game it was good but Still pissed cause of the cliffhanger
Best theory in a while mat
hears that last line
Me:
Don't you mean... 
"Best to.. 

LET IT GO! LET IT GO! üé∂üé∂"
Sorry this level is dlc ü§£ü§£ü§£
Edit: took me 4 hours to get a perfect from the dreaded Arielle music level.
I‚Äôm not even sure what‚Äôs happening at the start

Also MICKEY AGAIN!!!
3:09 Megalovania plays. (You know I had to do it.)
...Roy Conli, Who The Internet Knows To Look Exactly Like Xehanort...
Scott is making a new game!





He always comes back. :D
elsa coulda been the boss? woulda been awesome....thanks matpat, you made me even more angry with KH3... it was a crapfest
Yo..this actually makes so much sense. Great job matpat üëç
YOU"RE DAMN RIGHT I'M GONNA CRACK THAT EGG!!!! No matter how many times I have to do it by the Old Gods and New I will 100% . THIS GAME!!!!!!
OMG i play Kingdom Hearts 2.9
13:02 "fall into despair"
has a half-white half-black background
thanks for visiting my ted talk
It would be nice if someone could ask tetsuya Nomura about this theory at a convention or something
I feel that Elsa would be a better/‚Äúrelatable‚Äù role model if she actually dealt with her conflicts, turned ‚Äúbad‚Äù and then realized her true potential of being good again. It would give her character even more depth and many people would take away from it that ‚ÄúYeah, she obviously messed up by giving into her dark side but she was able to bounce back and right her wrongs once she realized her mistake.‚Äù

Disney really missed the ball on this one.
I think this is a good theory and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong, but I do think it‚Äôs missing one important piece. In KH3 (I‚Äôm not speaking for the other games cause I don‚Äôt remember every single world‚Äôs story) the in game story either occurs after or in a separate dimension of the movie (Toy Box, Monsteropolis, 100 acre wood, San Fransokyo) or it is very close to the same as the movie (Corona, Caribbean, Olympus, Arendelle), but your story‚Äôs theory doesn‚Äôt seem to fall into this pattern... Just some food for thought
Side note: Olympus is a special case because they used part of the story in a previous game, but it mostly still falls in the same as the movie category.
Please make a video on we happy few matpat.
Please return to this format MP
Actual video of you taking is just meh.
Disney would like to know your location
Square Enix: Has Ice Cream Cone (Represents the lost code and continuity).
Disney: Hits Ice Cream Cone out of Square's hand.
Square Enix: Tries to put what's remaining back in the cone.
Metaphor over.
It's clear disney had a much bigger say in this game. If you notice there was no final fantasy moments, significantly more time spent in Disney worlds and references. And finally the constant pop ups to use attractions related to disney parks. I loved the game but honestly it felt as if they ran out of money and had to give up significantly more share to disney
Dang. Now I want Ryan Reynolds to voice the next Disney princess...
IS NO ONE ELSE CONCERNED THAT DONALD OVERPOWERED FRICKING BAHAMUT?!
Good lord the quality of this theory and presentation is extraordinary. I can't believe how much sense this makes....
That stock photo guy that appears in all these videos has been through a lot... I think he deserves a vacation
2:56 I had this background playing while busting out some solitaire... Thought i finally lost my damn mind...
Oh gods!!!! That makes so much more sense! That level would have been infinitely better!!!!
Nothing escapes the long arm of Disney...
Yo make a theory that says that (the main protagonist of Kingdom Hearts) is a zora (from Legend of Zelda) that would be super cool
And it would've been a great level too, if it weren't for those meddling Disney lackeys.
The next kingdom hearts villain should be matpat!
Geez thanks mat, now i got phobias on mascotsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëèüëè
ooo, Scot you feel the burn?


Omg, I was DEAD..
Going thru a break up, but somehow u alway bring a laughter and positives vibe my way! Love you so much
Damn and here I am thinking Matpat may be loosing his theorizing touch. Thank you for making sense of my most despised level in KH3. The pieces were there but I was just too frustrated with the game to figure it out.
3:00 oh hey, letz make a theorie about Enter the Gungeon!
Man. That‚Äôs sad. It would have fit in perfectly with Elsa‚Äôs internal struggle she already has.
So you're saying that the GIANT WOLF boss could've been the CHAINED UP negativity and possibly RAGE of Elsa the maybe NORDIC princess?... I'm just spitballing but that kinda reminds me Fenrir.
Larxene: Ice isn't really my thing.

randomly zaps a pile of ice and creates an entire ice dungeon
I think mat should do more kingdom hearts :D. This was good
I would've enjoyed the original "game theory" version of Arandelle so much more.
please just make video (or videos) to explain the whole lore.
we need it
Vivid war flashbacks.  Best explanation  mat pat.
Yeah, Disney demanded its levels to reflect those "big moments" in the movies. Pixar had no such limitation on the game creators, and Monster's Inc and Toy Story reflect that.
With all the intro bits Matt does showing evil Mickey, you'd think he hated Disney for something.
They're trying to copy another game.
Why would this ever help such a game?
Nomura knows...
Typical MP video, you come for just  3 to 4 minutes and stay the whole 20... Great work man!
It's called "Disney is super overprotective of their biggest cash cow, so they won't allow Nomura and his team to do anything crazy with it." Except for the boss, Skoll. He's awesome, scary, and Hans's Heartless.
An EMPTY room FULL of enemies. Come on mat pat, come on.
Xaldin was no longer a member of the organization in kingdom hearts 3. He is also one of the other characters without a voice
I'm glad I put this game aside.
I'm not so glad I paid for it.
I heard the keyblade you get from cooking at the bistro kinda sucks unless you like fry panning every heartless/nobody/unversed
It would have been cool to see an internal conflict for Elsa with her rage bursting forth. Damn Disney and their stinking bubble wrapping. Old Disney would have done it.
Kingdom Hearts 3 Final MiX!!!
After getting knocked down the third time I was like: ‚Äú You might as well put in an ice labyrinth!‚Äù 
Oh wait-
Kingdom Hearts Lore  is so confusing it makes Dark Souls seem simple!
If you ever do a theory KH related, maybe talk about the dream theory  (everything that happens in KH3 is a dream... Sorta)
You can also tell by the wolf's color scheme that there was a conflict with light and darkness. (In Elsa not Hans)

Edit: Thx for 500+ likes
I COMPLETLY AGREE WITH YOU GAME THEORISTS. THIS LEVEL WAS REDICULOUS. Could you do videos on how you feel about the other levels too??? please???
I was thinking for a long time that dungeon was a part of the palace originaly
" C R A C K T H A T E G G , M A T P A T "
Love this theory. Legendary Matpat.
This makes so much sense. That level was so disjointed and Hans as a boss was random. I definitely think that ice Palace was meant to be Elsa's place. Damn, we really missed the chance for a cool story
it'll probably come back with the reMind DLC
This makes so much sense and I haven't even played the 3rd installment.
I finished watching the video and a kingdom  heat game trailer popped up
There's a youtuber that beads your help his name is
Marco
The fact that you swapped Mickey's outfit for his KH3 model, but kept his head 2D is perfection.

Also,
KINGDOM HEARTS LORE IS SO COMPLICATED THAT MATPAT DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT CONFIRMED

Also also, putting together the facts that Nomura wanted to use Arendelle back when Frozen was in development, 
It fits.
This should be an update
Sora was straight up going to be a vessel for Xehanort's soul. Soooo...
:Xzavior:the start was funny but don't do that to my favorite gamw
This makes some much sense and would have been the best level if it played this way
The micky mouse voice killed meü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
next up: whats in the black box
This makes a lot more sense.

And I felt like the Ice Labyrinth looked like a rejected concept for the White Witch's castle for a Narnia based world
Jus like the developers STOP putting any focus on "people who haven't played the game" they're not watching this video if they've never played ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶
MatPat: This lore is so complex it makes Scott's lore look straight forward
Fate Series: Hold my beer
I <3 Game Theory!
MAN, your theory is so convincing that I imagine you just sent off a bunch of fanfic writers to recreate this whole Frozen scenario in the game universe, just to satiate theirs and other peoples' needs to see this as Canon. 
fyi- I have accepted your theory as Canon. Kudos to you.
I absolutely love your Mickey scenes MatPat üíñüòÇüòÇüòÇ always good for a laugh, ha-HA! üòÇ
This was an excellent theory. Your take on it makes tons of sense and would‚Äôve been Amazing way to see her evolve into the evil ice wolf. Very cool üòé
i wonder if matpat would be willing to make a game theory on cytus 2?
Matpat you said this but we get this. What i mean is where is kirby part 2? WHERE!!!
They should make a john carter kingdom hearts game
It would have been cool if Elsa and Larxene had a similar relationship to Xaldin and Beast in KH2 where Larxene is constantly hovering over Elsa making her believe that darkness is the only way.
It's so frustrating they did that. If this is true (and I have no doubt it is, because it makes too much sense) then why the heck did they scrap it? Yeah, to protect the image of Elsa for young girls, but do those young girls even know what Kingdom Hearts is? I didn't know what it was until I was out of elementary, and I still haven't played the dang thing.
I am so glad someone else other then me noticed this üíñ
I know how stressful some of these episodes are you just gotta LET IT GOOOO
(Sorry lol XD)
So this is the level i could've played.....








this leads me into depression
F you disney you ruined that beautiful world i could've played


>:((((((
Maybe there will be some dlc of the original version at some point????? That would be so dope.
Top 10 Anime Rivalries
#1: MatPat vs. Mickey Mouse
Hearing Age of Empires music makes me thinking it's Spirit of the Law I'm watching again. Interesting choice.
There's one storyline you can NEVER trounce, both in complexity AND feels beatings: Dark Souls.
Also square enix was named a very long time ago sqaure soft
it wouldn't be surpising, could also explain why the game took SO long to come out
Matpat: makes theory about frozen in kingdom hearts
Two weeks later
Nomura: announces kh3 frozen dlc
If square enix wasn't told to cut corners by Disney, it's for Final Fantasy VII remake
I like to watch the video quietly so nobody hears me, so every time the intro is on, I have to turn down my volume!
I love how mickey is physco and i loathe those Truffrooms Truffles = Mushrooms
MatPat!
Remember the destiny video from 2015?
It has come some rumors about a destiny 3 Where You can embrace the darkness.

Maby You can make a theory about that
It's also worth mentioning that Larxene is lightning element, not ice. How the hell is Larxene making an ice labyrinth?
8:22 yep. qnd this ladies and gentlemen is why kh iii felt so lackluster...

ar least it resolved the plot at the end before adding "no character development" ...
Mod Maker Squad, MOVE NOW!!
Wow! Especially when considering the original story oh, this makes so much sense!
The lore isn't that complicated if you only play the good ones lol. Coincidentally they are the first 4 that came out.
Kh1, CoM, kh2, and 358.
"We never even get to see his face"
*shows face*
16:26 ...Journey? Can't leave out that masterpiece
The first minute if this video killed me ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
My mom just finished the game and I have one more world o I felt like I need some more kh3
Real talk: one of the trailers actually hints at all of this being fact because it actually focuses on Arendelle being a core part of the plot; something it failed at being upon release.
I would love to have seen her "bad" side turn into an Ice Wolf. Personally it makes since.
They did force them to use the songs. Why wouldn't they? Nothing else about the movie was memorable, and even then, way overdone with a million covers and parodies.
Always so interesting whether interested in and or played the games you Theorise just love the whole education you give Quality work as ever Thanks Nice one
U wot m8??
Wow matpat your theory is better than what Disney choose 
Seriously why this level would been better and more smart
Welp Disney failed
How am I supposed to watch game theory and film theory at the same time?

Ilysm ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit Thx so much for all the likes. I‚Äôve never gotten this many.üíï
This would have been one of the best levels in the Gaines Danny Disney damn you
LMAO "mouse" LMAO
MY NAME IS KAIRI    (my dad named me  :>)
honestly I had to watch this a 2nd time to actually understand this, it might be because I never played kingdom hearts
We now know who to blame for KHIII's multiple delays.
lol, i'm only on the opening and i'm already entertained, though i have never agreed to any theories of yours, they still keep me entertained and make me laugh.
How about Elsa transformed into an Ice Wolf because she is, or feels alone, like a "lone wolf"
Plus larxene has never displayed any skill or ability to actually produce something like the ice maze
Par for the course when it comes to Disney at this point. 
Anyone with a decent idea: Here's a great idea!
Disney: Ok! Make it a thing!
Anyone: Here it is, fully fleshed out and ready to be awesome and make you lots of money!
Disney: Great, now make it so that when anyone tries to enjoy it without being a mouse humper they will think that they are looking at it through a kaleidoscope.
Game theory: *has KH theory
Me: okay I believe you!
"speaking of!" 15:56  xD
Oh my God I want to see this original level so much right now. Thanks Matt, because I'll never have chance to ._.
This is good stuff. I wish the game went this way ;_;
Maybe final mix dlc will revamp arendelle? Probably not
Matpat:it makes Scott looks simple 





Scott:Oh no bro

Releases fnaf for VR
Yah know, I think if Kingdom Hearts actually did follow that storyline, then it would've made both the movie and game even more awesome.
Why the hell you would cooking in time like this sora is supposed to save the world not cooking!
How..
How did i not see this during that fight! Its so freaking obvious. Also that wouldnt of been a bad thing to do. A severely good story could of been made out of that.
Wow, this theory does make a lot of sense and you're right, that level feels so glued together and out of place to the rest of the game.
To summarize Kingdom Hearts.

Final Fantasy characters go on Disney theme park rides.
This makes so much sense. Since there is obviously more to this level, I wouldnt be surprised if hackers later manage to get out of bounds and actually find some proof.
That end transition for the logo tho!!
Ahem...see the Frozen Broadway track Monster:

"....A monster, were they right?
Has the dark in me finally come to light?
Am I a monster full of rage
Nowhere to go but on a rampage?
Or am I just a monster in a cage?..." ‚ùÑ
marshmallow is a girl btw...watch the post credit scene
Everyone knows KH3 got delayed several times too. Maybe this change was a cause of the delays.
3:08 He already HALF XEHANORT!!!
15:30

"BLACK MAGIC BARS OUR WAY"
YOU MISSED A PUN at the end intsed of :some time its best not to metel : you coud have sayed :some times its best to LET IT GO       great video love your stuff:D
I know all of the answers to all of matpats theories "video game and cartoon logic" üò±üò±üò≤üòØ
Square Enix: Has Ice Cream Cone (Represents the lost code and continuity).
Disney: Hits Ice Cream Cone out of Square's hand.
Square Enix: Tries to put what's remaining back in the cone.
Metaphor over.
hey matpat,as a greek person i can confirm the greek letter œá is pronounced like he
That...makes sense. And actually, I kind of assumed that the ice dungeon was the ice castle? Like, it started as larxene imprisoning you, but then transported you to the ice castle's basement or something. And...hm. am I wrong, or do you only see the nobody symbol once in there?
Walt would have gone into a psychotic murderous rampage if he saw kingdom hearts
Overall, Elsa was wasted anti-hero potential.
It might be too hot for Disney, but it will never be too hot for Will Smith.
DLC INCOMMINGüòÇüòÇ just kidding
That intro was legendary
I would actually pay for DLC of this true, intended Arendelle level because it makes so much more sense and seems more satisfying to go through.
Next up KH3: Final Mix this time with the real Arandelle Level
One day matpat is going to be arrested for knowing too much
amazing theory - i want to replay this level, but properly now
This level have so much potential and how the boss fight it will be a really good map I wish Disney didn't interfere
This is actually one of the most believable theories I've seen yet
Could you do a theory on Popee the Performer? It‚Äôs a really weird/cool YouTube channel that has a strange story line. I think it would be fun to see what you could do with it.
13:03 junko maniacally laughs in the background
Man I love that maniac mikey xD
So despite the insistence here that the wolf bore no relevance to Hans specifically, it was actually something I thought was a good beast comparison for him symbolically! While the theory here, of course, makes worlds more of sense out of the level, the idea of Hans as a "wolf in sheep's clothing" actually really made the boss for me during my first playthrough. :3c
Anyone else hear the extra beat/drum in the intro?
That's what happens when you choke creativity.
Game theory can I recommend a game call "lobotomy coperation" in your future theory? No? Welp I tried.... >_>


Still love your theory <3
Also, they made memes about the map showing goofy or Donald saying something and getting dragged on in the snow
This theory makes so much sense is more satisfying then the level itelf
Disney:how dare you ruin this character
Mat pat:it was just a theory
I swear your  introductions are getting more and more sadistic.
BENDY is that you 00:22 and nevermind
I got so shook at how he pronounces appreciate "aprushiate"
Intro shows Disney slowly driving MatPat insane
OMG didn't know there was a cooking keyblade!!!!
This makes so much sense. I would've loved to see this in the game.
I'm kinda mad now
Think about how much hype the game would have gotten from its players if ‚Äúdark Elsa‚Äù ended up being the villain. I haven‚Äôt played KH at all but I‚Äôd like to assume that would have been the coolest level (pun not intended).
You know if you play my sanctuary backwards you can here secret messages.
This would have been a way better story arc then what we got to fit the whole of KH3 since Sora saw Vanitas for the first time and coming to term with the darkness in him since you can transform into his dark form the whole game this would have fit in perfectly
I loved the cooking minigame :'(
Main characters being world villains is nothing new. Beast was corrupted by Xaldin when you visited Beast's Castle and you had to purge him. so I would have liked to of seen Elsa also corrupted
You should do a theory if Goofy is evil or an antagonist. This came out well, keep up the good work
Omg that opening x'D You've no idea how much I've wanted to smack these guys over the head every time they pointed out ingredients when all I wanted was to track down those freaking lucky emblems without resorting to looking their locations up on the internet.

I wouldn't say Phil was the only other hole in the voice casting though. Both Aeleus and Dilan are completely silent, literally just stepping forward and smiling awkwardly when Ansem the Wise returns to his lab, when you'd expect at least one of them to say something there.

Anyway, I love this theory. Would have been way better than the half hearted throw-in of Hans...
No backstory required! Now, here's everything you need to know.
My gosh, Ryder will give Bret Iwan a run for his money
That ice labyrinth also doesn't make sense for another reason,  Larxene doesn't have ice powers at all,  she has lightning and electricity based abilities so how could she just make an entire labyrinth out of a material she has NO CONTROL OVER?
jfc, Mickey went mad.
The beginning sound affects: ewwwww... ASMR
Organization 13 = Article 13??
2:57 got it
Before the official reveal, the idea of Maleficent being in the world influencing Elsa was a very nice concept.
I would have loved a reference to the original plan of Elsa being antagonistic. She'd go into despair at the end and become a boss fight. It would be somewhat of a parallel to Sora saving Aqua later on.
Ayo who else saw that FNaF 7 vid pop up for one second?
only stupid people will dislike this very "factual" theory
I say it's not a theory, it's the "truth" üòÇ
I love the intro music
This would have been awesome!

I‚Äôm also curious why the trolls weren‚Äôt involved. ‚ÄúThe head can be persuaded, but the heart is not so easily changed.‚Äù How Kingdom Hearts does that sound?!
That would be a better level. I would love to see something where a main character was making bad decisions but had a change of heart and became good again. That would be something to look up to for girls (and boys) going through rough timesüíï
Wow its been a while since ive been genuinely invested in a game theory lol this one makes a HELL of a lot of sense. I was cool with this level cuz I just didnt care much about it? Lol I didnt notice how bad it was until others pointed it out. Dang, that level mustve been poppin originally haha
U never took anything from the game code like u said u would
Is mickey mouse has gone crazy in the intro?? Gasp (why am i still practicing his voice)
Godammit disney
I always felt like Hans just came out of nowhere in the actual movie itself, like he wasn't the actual villan to begin with
Game Theory: Samus is a goddess/Vridi Aran. # episode suggestions.
matpat please make the second part of the kirby is evil. I am not demanding it but can you make it soon
I haven't played KH since the first one but IF Elsa had been the boss in KH3, I don't think I could've played it. Or I would've to save her T^T
It‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúkai‚Äù
Kingdom Hearts 3: Hot Coffee mod
Your theory's are giving us a lot of lessons. I highly appreciate it.
Everytime I do the cooking minigame I fail before I even know what‚Äôs going on.
As always, well put Ÿ©( ·êõ )( ·êñ )€∂. This is the only explanation I‚Äôve heard that makes sense.
Hey, Mattyboy! Did anyone ever told ye you look like the young Kenny Loggings?
Hey look the Internet in the EU after article 17/13 XD
The Ice Wolf's name is Skoll, So that may imply there was another wolf somewhere named Hati. Perhaps both of them occupied a arena as a boss.
Idk if this has been mentioned but X(CHI) is pronounced K-AI not ch-ee or K-ee
Man, what‚Äôs with all of these back to back film theory/game theory days?





I‚Äôm not complaining.







:)
I live for Kingdom Hearts
Thank you finally something i havent found a flaw in
Waiting for Boundary Brake on this game..... I hate invincible wall so much :(
The intros are getting better and better XD
Never knew I wanted THIS kind of theory about KH until I saw it O_O
The intros are getting better and better XD
The intros are getting better and better XD
The intros are getting better and better XD
Please do a Sally Face theory. And finish the game.
Funny how Disney won't allow Kingdom Hearts to let Elsa give in to the Darkness, but allows her to question whether her parents really wanted her on Once Upon a Time.
Man you made some really excellent points here. Considering how broken and unsatisfying the level was and the fact that Hans served no purpose in this world, it would‚Äôve been great to see the story progress the way you mentioned. It‚Äôs a shame Disney had to meddle in Nomura‚Äôs vision like that üò©
Disney:sue this channel we have gave it  too many chances 
 
Mickey Mouse:MUWHAHAHAHAHHA MATPAT NOT SO SMART KNOW!!!
WOW a 2019 game theory that is good and not fnaf.
Arendelle
AKA Skyrim for Idiots
Man now I wish they did not cut that out.

It would have been a good game and interesting to play I don‚Äôt think it would ruined Elsa reputation I think it would actually make it grow but you know what like in the movie and in the game you just have ‚Äúto let it go‚Äù
I like K.H.2 better.
10:00:00
Disney, I can't believe you've done this.
Matpat:you wont see hans's face
3 seconds later.....
matpat:i mean im wrong theres his face
I like how sora is more worried bout being blown away by the blizzard wind, When he clearly has a problem with his shorts on and a short sleeve shirt on during A BLIZZARD
The whole wolf thing would also make sense of her character. She kept trying to keep herself alone and away from Arendelle because she felt she did more harm than good, making her sort of a lone wolf. This theory makes a lot of sense.
when playing through for the first time i actually thought we'd be fighting elsa from what larxene said
PLS do a theory on Oxenfree
dam, youre Genius

This design was my original theory before release. Now it‚Äôs the level my friends cite specifically for being terrible and the game being the worst of the trilogy
I'm calling your theory true I like it better than the what we actually have

I would have much preferred playing this than what it ended up being. It makes so much more sense, and I don't think too many people would have been upset, along as she eventually got that redemption at the end.
It's  soon gonna be on a Nintendo switch
No one has said it yet? Ok then I will.
Disney really should have

Petition to get a huge game patch with this game as the justification and reference? If it's in the code they might be able to do something, especially if the community is already in such an uproar.
Best intro of 2019
When I played that world it felt more like a throw a way level. It didn't feel like kingdom hearts. This theory really explained alot
Mat Vs Mickey

I need more of this battle between gods
Oh my God, you're right. They totally didn't model Hans' face.

Bruh, it's not a theory. It's FACT.
Luxord: take this card, it will be useful in KH4
Sora: Nice
Luxord: when it releases in 2024
Sora: Not nice
I knew something was off about that level, now I feel only a bit more disappointed üòïüòÇ
the opening had me rolling
kingdom hearts not complex but more so a lot to remember names and faces being the big ones its a lot and they are very upfront with the details but you need like a whole cliff notes page for one scene
I just realized that if Kingdom Hearts 3 had anything new to add I would have liked it
I'm surprised matpat hasn't accused mickey of being a sociopath.
Going to go watch TetraNinja's play though really quite. Can't take that long, can it? (then why am I putting the date....) 3/25/19

I'm back! I watched TehNevs play "Birth By Speep" too. Took a while, using all my breaks at work to watch. Great games! Now to finish watching the theory before work! 4/3/19

oh i thought i was on fire for a moments
Welcome back Maniac Mickey! Yeah, I actually liked the mini cooking game,lol
these intros just keep getting better than ever
misheard that first line as 
"this might be a good spot to find some immigrants"
Friendship and love yaaaay sarcasum
Kingdom Hearts is basically your kryptonite. It doesn‚Äôt really follow logic or physics. There‚Äôs not even fall damage. You can survive falls from skyscrapers!!
This makes me glad I didn't bother with the new game.
Disney once again ruins everything because of their asinine image sensitive branding.z
I sincerely hope they go bankrupt one day. I hope they get another Eisner who destroys them from the top down once and for all.
I love the fade to teh intro they do with Mikey Mouse laughing hope to see more of that
lmao love your voice acting XD
The intro is the best
Matpat:ELSA IS THE VILLAIN 

my theory:ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY üí∞ 


If there is a comment the same as mine I didn‚Äôt know so please don‚Äôt think I copied
FREAKING DISNEY!!!!
Let's be honest, the best parts of Kingdom Hearts always have nothing to do with the Stuff that Disney shoves inside this Franchise :p
Kind of lazy game development if you ask me.
This plot would have been wayyyyy more interesting and I would have liked the world so much more.
what about sora committing not feeling so good
I 100% believe this theory.
I wonder if we could get Shesez to do a Boundry Break on this level.
This channel holds a special place in my heart
I never liked Kingdom Hearts. To me the games were all gimmick and no substance, and needlessly complicated in its narrative.
Can you please do a Fantasy Life Theory?
Is it just me, or does Larxene look like an electric-type gym-leader?
HEY YOU. 

YA YOU, MATPAT



WATCH STEVEN UNIVERSE AND MAKE A THEORY 




PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 


THERE IS SOMETHING THERE
Disney taking over Fox scares me.  They are turning into a evil company with a monopoly, killing the creativity competition.
hey i love marshmallow don't jock him, he is my big snow puppy
I actually really enjoyed this
If this theory was a fact, this game level would have been SOOOOOOOOO MUTCH BETTER.
I guess Matt just does not "let it go"








no? ok. am going to leave now
ok i have to say that this makes so much damn sense and if it isnt correct then id be a bit pissed
Matpat. This is great, but, I‚Äôve never watched frozen
I love this intro
Wouldn't want a good story getting in the way of all that brand power...
If they made a DLC about this, then I would scratch my head towards Disney's decision, if this were true.
Lets get crackin'
16:04 That's literally every bit of gameplay in this entire game.
Not gonna lie, kingdom's hearts lore is all over the place and long as hell you literally have to play all the games which will take you about 1 to 2 months to figure it out.
Actually, Nomura already confirmed in an interview that the boss of Arendelle was supposed to be a giant ice castle Heartless that was instead repurposed as a Gummi Ship boss. So you were right in assuming something was changed at the last minute, but not in what was changed. I'm still 100% sure the ice dungeon was supposed to be Elsa's palace though, that was my first thought when I played it as well.
Mat-Pat should make a game theory Game
Wait your rivals with mouse?? I would know, he kidnapped me and took me too, THE CLUBHOUSE.
I really, really hate the frozen movie... but this level was so painful it actually has made me stop playing for a while. 


kinda just disappointed in kh3 as far as i've played...
Why am i watching this i'v never played kingdom hearts
Man this was such an anticipated world in KH!! I would‚Äôve loved this storyline!! It had soooo much potential, and they just ruined it!! Just...ugh! This theory makes so much sense!  Elsa had a lot in common with Riku, they could‚Äôve done something there
If you lose your heart you can't speak
old intro is so loud
This is the type of video I love to see
I‚Äôm still watching but that intro was so good I had to like.
This theory reminds me of how I thought she could easily be a villain
By the off chance someone sees this comment, Can you do a theory on blaster master zero 2 for switch. I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of theory potential in the character Leibniz.
Seems funny that game developers know the characters better than the creators and owners of them. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this was all or mostly true. 

Disney not wanting to make a role model character look bad. Scrapping a story that would make her seem even better in the long run. Overcoming/beating the darkness within would be much better than just not choosing it.
You know, hearing what you said as well as playing the game when it came out.  It actually makes so much sense, It would have been so much better if they did what you had said instead of the way the did it now.
Disney Studios would like to know your location
Damnit Disney this would‚Äôve been such a dope level if it‚Äôs truly what was planned ;-;
Can you do a Naruto theriy
10:45
 
wolf in sheep clothing. DUH!
Best intro ever
Even in the movie, she was supposed to be the villain first, until they changed it. Makes sense that the game replicated it, since it was decided 2013.
I love how Mickey keeps getting more and more eViLlLlL!!!
11:37 this sounds like dialogue from a fan fiction
Dude get to the point, you say bits of code then talk about theory that is conjecture nothing more.
Disney is simply the biggest empire and is continuing to rise and will do things their way without much care for the audience on some occasions and we‚Äôve just gotta accept it. Smh RIP KH3
(I still loved the game though)
Aww man, I would have loved to see that level
This is probably the MOST LIKELY theory you've EVER MADEü§£
It's always confusing to me that in today's age everyone seems to think women need role models in EVERYTHING, media, movies, games, comics etc who constantly tote "strong and independent"..I don't know about you, but it would seem to me that people who are truly strong and independent don't need constant pats on the pack to tell them they're doing good..it seems like pandering on an extremely high level.

To the point of the video, it's honestly sad that the above has such a cascading effect on everything it touches, Elsa isn't allow to have any kind of REAL deep character writing simply because she's a "role model" for "good" and because of that fact alone it prevents her from being a genuinely decent character..and the same can be said for practically all female characters in modern movies, rather than make them interesting and deep characters, they're often just slapped with the OP label just so they can be powerful "role models" (Rey, Captain Marvel etc) They aren't allowed to fail, they aren't allowed to lose, they aren't allowed to have ANY conflict that goes against the pre scripted narrative of being anything short of "perfect"...which..no one is, so really the narrative modern day media tries to push is completely unobtainable, Ironic that the same people have accused others of so many times. (Like changing Barbies body type because it was an "unrealistic goal" for girls to aim for)
When you think of it, this theory makes perfect sense.
Why is pirates the only live action series repped in Disney games  nutcracker and the four realms. Tomorrow land  BFG etc

2013 makes sense why we don't get lion guard or descendants representation I hope we do in a future KH game
Weirdly enough Xenanort was still easier to fight than The one winged angel himself
18:40 or so,   Who expected him to instead say 
"Sometimes it's best to just Let it Go..." ?    XD
I haven't played this game but the theory makes a lot of sense. If the frozen level was made before the movie came out and Disney has a lot of influence...
If the theory is wrong then it would just be poor game and level design.
Nah bro, thats just his fursona.
It would have been better if they had Elsa split into 2 separate light and dark entities that sembolizes her internal struggle.
How can the intro get any better
When you come out of church and matpat blesses us with 2 episodes back to back...
One of the best Keyblades? pleaseee.. Just do all the classic games for an even better one. Or just get ultima weapon.
Love the kingdom hearts
i really like this this theory <3
Hey, what about the obvious Star Wars knods?  Dude straight up fights with a lightsaber.  Those gummi-ship sequences would've been good for dog fights against Emperial Tie-fighters and the sorts.  Not to mention MARVEL!!!!
That Intro though

Edit: I love wolves though

Car salesman  
Car salesman: This bad boy can fit so much wasted potential
That makes a lot of sense! When I went back to Elsa's Castle and saw a bit of her castle on the map, I was upset I couldn't go though and though maybe it was a tease for upcoming DLC.
That introüòÇ
Matpat I‚Äôll come back to you after I watch the series
wish they just stopped censoring and diminishing creative ideas...
My mission in life...
Get MatPat to do a theory on my game!
that KH2.9 screen flash is the developers way of saying this was not the KH3 they wanted.
....couldn't care less about the parallels, or connections. Just here for one of the best intros ever!
3:07 I thought I was having a stroke
This is AMAZING!
I'm a simple man:




I see a Game Theory on Kingdom Hearts, I click like a madman.
Get ready for a new theory mat pat I have a feeling that there might be a NEW fnaf game in the making...
I only liked the end boss fight of thatüòêüòê
This actually makes perfect sense.
Disney : oh no.... OH no.... OH NO.!!!!!!
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
Mouse has made it to Game Theory.

We're doomed.
This is a good theory!
Wow.... this version of the level sounds far better.
6:46

SPIDER-MAT!!!! üòÅ
Mickey Mouse before : Hiya Kids! 




Mickey Mouse now : EAT THOSE MUSHROOMS , AHAHAHAHAHAH!! 








Look how they massacred '' ours '' Boy




( Communist Theme plays in the distance )
Dang I really hate to see all of the potential go to waste...
1:07 Momo on crack
I know this is probably a stupid question but can someone tell me who the reoccurring dude is at 2:13? I literally have no idea...
This is EXACTLY what I thought happened!
Interesting theory, but the wolf boss couldn't be Elsa...because ya know ELSA'S NOT A HEARTLESS
The Disney team trying to protect Elsa's image as a hero, when she was always the villain of Frozen. Seriously, she is the main antagonist of Frozen. She's the one who sets the whole conflict in motion, and she even attacks the protagonist (Anna) at some point. Hans is used in the movie as a secondary antagonist to do precisely that, protect Elsa's image as the true antagonist of the story, but, regardless of her intentions or what Hans did, she is still the main antagonist of Frozen and it would make a lot of sense for her to be the villain in Kingdom Hearts too.
I don‚Äôt play these games because games like fallout 4 are the rpgs I like
I just ignored the whole cooking bit.
XD That beginning though...
can we like..send Nomura this video and let them know that we know what happened during development now and let him know that its ok?
I remember when I went through the level I was thinking "Where did this Ice Maze come from? Larxene broke a big ice block and it turned into this gigantic labyrinth?" I don't know if that was what the idea was or not, but it sure as hell is confusing either way. The maps themselves are designed really well, and the enemies are great for the area, but the finished product makes little to no sense altogether.
Wouldnt be surprised if disney would remove this video, but if they did it would only make it clear that its correct.
Disney wants to know your location
This makes a lot of sense, actually
That sounds a lot more fun than what is in the level. Maybe if we have any luck they'll see the errors of their ways and have an update that makes the level more comprehensible
Game Character: Exists
Game Theory: Wait, That Illegal
i guess you could say austins old theory for kingdom hearts actually does potray mickey as the bad guy in the begining haha
The ice maze part was the most puzzling... I mean... Larxene traps you under some ice blocks and then you find yourself in a gigantic ice structure with elevators and trasures scattered all over...
How could Larxene create such a maze in a few seconds?
She even says that ice is not really her kind of interest...
 Larxene could have a future as an ice sculptor if she can make such a building from just some ice blocks :D

I strongly believe your theory is correct!
8:35 thats funny since this lvl really made me not stocked for frozen 2 xD
If portals were possible in dissidia then it's possible with kingdom hearts
DUNANANANANA DUNANANANANAN DUNANANANANANA SLENDER HANS
onna punches me
Am I the only one who is looking for the actual level cuz now I'm interested
moar kingdom hearts please
How Game Developers spend their time. 60% As a Slave to Clients. 30% as a slave to players. 10% Actually making games
This is not a theory, Mat actually works for Disney
I‚Äôve come up with a new recipe
This looks like a good spot to make a Game Theory
your version is so much better.
spoilers remember aqua in the realm of darkness
yea it's no secret that the brand team for frozen basically wanted as little to do with kingdom hearts as possible to the point the story there wasn't very coherent at all. sora barely knew any of the characters in that world and yet he talked about them like they were old pals. and then for the villain the game was just like "look! player! he's the bad guy! see the dark smoke!? sick im'!"
3:03 that is a slow moving city for how long he was there
Tbh I prefer the scrapped version
Yes it is ironic, it is also common sadly Matt.
This lvl would have been way better than what we got; if your theory is right. Which I think you are lol.
Aside from how annoying it is that people think every fictional female character has to be some sort of role model for impressionable little girls, I don't see what would have been the problem with having the story be about Elsa's struggle between light and darkness? If the ultimate goal is to have the other heroic characters help her defeat the darkness inside herself and make a triumphant return to the light, I'd say that's still pretty on brand overall for Disney. Female characters are allowed to have complex stories yo.
Love the new intro lol
Do a theory about Oxenfree
lol the mini games...but call me when your trying to get all the darn trophy's - minigames... from hell!
After 9+ minutes of waiting, at 9:01 minutes MatPat FINALLY, FINALLY started his theory.
matpat's next video:
"I am getting sued by disney"
Soo THEY DIDN'T  WANT TO RECAST PHIL BUT THEY HAD NO PROBLEM RECASTING XEHANORT I know they need him but R.I.P lenord Nimoy
The Mickey Mouse skits always crack me up






No that was not an intended egg pun....  -_-'
I'm scared ;-;
All the cogs were already in my head, but it took you to get them turning.
organiazation 13? more like Section 31
100% agree
Honestly. I would have loved this to have been the frozen level.
yeah yeah matpat but just to tel you please do a theory on subnatica please
Annnnnnnnnd welcome to the best show down ever.... 

MAT .vs.  MICKEY MOUSE


Who will win
It's been a while since the last time I've seen this channel, and I wouldn't expect less. The Frozen scenario seemed too big, but unused where it should. This theory is pretty interesting to fill out those blanks that would make that scenario look better.
I expect you give a chance to theorize about Larxene's past and whereabouts. Cheers! ü•Ç
INFINITIE TWISTING!
YOU CAN HAVE ANNE, OLOF, KISOF AND SFEN! YOU IDITE
Sora, Donald and Goofy were probably the metaphor for the square Enix team, trying to make the stage amazing. But kept thrown off, until they finally went Disney's way.
Awww it would've been such a cool level to play though. And as long as she turns good at the end it's actually following the movie's plot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Nice clickbait!
What was that intro
I LOVE THE DISNEY INTROS EVIL MICKY
Seeing the throwaway line, along with the 'tweet' about her singing helping Sora&co understand her, made me think it was a homage to her backstory as a written character, A.K.A the fact she was intended as the bad guy until Let It Go talked the scriptwriters into making her a hero.
Disney: can we copyrightstrike this? youtube, my old friend?
Youtube: ehhhhhh... i have to think about that.

Disney: come on!

To be continued...
lol the start of the vid
This makes a HUGE amount of sense!  It's too bad that we got what we did...
That explains why frozen never felt like a actual  level
8:04 Well he took this gun and he BOOM
next step: make Disney apologize and get a patch released to bring back the original Frozen level.
Yeah how wonderful fam! Hot damn!
OK, Mat. I don't usually comment on your videos(since most of them are pretty good) but I wanted to point out 2 things in this video. Also, I am NOT hating on Mat OR Disney. I'm just a humble commenter.
(fair warning this comment might get long)


1: Even though I don't play kingdom hearts, I have seen the playthroughs of Arendelle. And this video makes TOTAL sense! And I think your version of  Arendelle would be MUCH better than the one in the game. Just wish that's what we got!


And 2: What happened between you and Disney?! I mean back in 2017, you kept complaining that Disney never invited you to an MCU movie premier. And you even got sponsored by Disney XD for the Duck tales episode(good episode BTW)! And now you're making Mickey a flipping psycho! As a die-hard fan of both GT and FT as WELL as Disney, I feel like something happened and now you've basically declared Mickey a villain! I mean you can think what you think but maybe take this into consideration.


Look mat, I get that Disney has been making some not so smart decisions recently but I don't get why you and other people harp on Mickey! I know he's the mascot and all but Mickey is a hero. He defeated MALEFICENT for Walt's sake! Mickey is a separate person than that of Disney. Even in Kingdom hearts, Mickey is one of the most AWESOME characters in the series, is a respected hero, and is a KING! If your gonna make someone the embodiment of Disney's greed, make it someone like Pegleg Pete or Maleficent or something! 


People make jokes about Disney being evil but the truth is: Disney's a company. Run by humans. People make mistakes. Granted some of those mistakes have brought them BIG consequences(looking at you Solo), but think of it this way. Mickey doesn't represent the business side of Disney, he's a hero. He is willing to do anything to be kind, supportive and compassionate. And even then, he makes mistakes every now and then. Yen Sid's hat, Epic Mickey. He's not perfect, but he does try to make up for the mistakes he makes.


And before someone says "It's a joke!" I am aware. And mat's version of Mickey is HILARIOUS. I just think it's a little too harsh.


Like I said Mat, I don't agree with some of the decisions Disney has been making, but It is kinda sad to see a great character like Mickey get dragged down because of something out of his control. 


I'm not gonna end this comment with a cheesy "That's just a theory" joke but a sincere ask. Maybe cut the little guy some slack. Thanks for reading!




Anyway, just take that into consideration. Hope you and anyone who reads this has a great day!
The begining, LOL. Just LOL.
HONESTLY this makes more sense. I overall thought this was way to shallow compared to the rest of the series....
To be honest, this level was one I was looking the most forward to in the game. When I heard it would be featured, I was super excited because I really liked Frozen as somebody who really doesn‚Äôt believe in the true love at first sight nonsense that Disney did for a really long time and really enjoyed that sibling-familial love was the most important. But when I jumped on way under level to play it (skipping I think monsters inc which is the next level you‚Äôre supposed to do because I was too eager to wait), it was just disappointing. Not to mention super confusing to make your way around. A lot of the other levels had distinct differences in areas which made it easier to tell where you needed to go versus where you‚Äôd been, but even with the mini map, I found myself continually lost beyond belief as to where I was supposed to go. And seeing this theory and thinking back to how the level played out, I was really disappointed. If they wanted to keep it similar to the movie to begin with, like Tangled did, then having Hans as the more predominant villain should‚Äôve been the way to go from the beginning. But as Mat said, so much of that level was just slapped together and it didn‚Äôt fit into the rest of the game at all. No hate to the previous games since I own all console titles,  but it felt like the first two console games and how there really was no interaction with the level itself compared to the other stages. You just spend an hour and a half wandering snowy hills that look like the same textures over and over again. If this theory really was what they intended to do from the beginning, it really would‚Äôve been INFINITELY better in terms of story, level design, and character building. There really was no ‚ÄúSora, you have the power‚Äù or whatever which we see in the other levels that give Sora and his team more determination to keep going and reaffirm what they‚Äôve done so far. It was just a cop out at the end with no payoff. It ended up being my least liked level despite the fact I sung along with Elsa‚Äôs song as she climbs the mountain. I get trying to save a brand, but sometimes finding a new spin on things reinvigorates the hype around it and gives people a new perspective on what potentially could‚Äôve been. 

Overall, Arendelle was arguably the worst level in KH3 and I really wish that this theory‚Äôs version of what could‚Äôve been is what should‚Äôve been.
new feeling to the video content because its not so much mind blown for me this time . It is so obviously cut and change to become like this. but yeah ,about Elsa being the boss is kinda blow me. Never figured that Nomura would get "was planed to be villain" to become actual villain in crossover . that would be fresh stuff but i know, risk one .

So, with the  Devs' hint and community's effort . Story yet still delivered :)
Idk if this is an unpopular opinion but I HATED the little mermaid KH2 level as a kid.  I replayed the game so many times and never liked that level
hand rubbing suddenly stopped at didney
Man! I cannot do that stupid egg cracking!
What bothered me the most about the maze is that Larxene made it. Her element is thunder! Ice is Vexen. It's like saying that Luxord (His element is time and luck [Don't ask]) can summon a Tsunami wave that didn't let Sora reach the flying Dutchman...
Shame, that original idea sounds like it would‚Äôve been cool
we should be safe here! aOAYFAYGUF
1:43 lol XD
Do you think the next KH theory could be if Sora had a monster? And if he did, who was it? I found it kinda funny how Sora reacted in Monstropolis, and how Mike had to keep insisting that they didn't scare kids anymore when Sora looked at him...
I'm so sad now...

Disney is the worst these days. They are ruining everything, from Star Wars to their own classics. And now KH... in theory.

I want that story so bad.
I feel like Matpat would be agreat writer
If you play this at 0.5x, it sounds like matpat just woke up.
who eles thinks that if this is true it would be better than what was released?
I felt this was the most boring level I ever played
Solid argument.
and Narratively it would make Elsa a much more relatable and strong person.

There is no weakness in stumbling. 
Only in staying down.
there is no strength in standing.
Only in taking a stand.

it is the expression and overcoming of conflicts that connects to the strength of a character.
What a great intro
DAMN YOU DISNEY!!!!!!!
We cant have elsa be realistically flawed. Thats misogynistic.
Di u say KINGDOM HAARRTTSS?!?!?? ( i‚Äôm actually play dat game!)
Zeeehanort ü§£
The truth is, they didn't want to reveal that Elsa has a fursona.
To tell the story is time travel
the letter "X" isn't the greek letter "Chi" its just "CH" I know that because im from Greece :D
Saying the cooking keyblade is one of the best in the game
Ultima Weapon: Am i a joke to you
Actually, great I love it I will pretend that this is the storyline when I play this world
I'm kind of upset that at the end of the video you didn't say "sometimes it's better, to let it go".
Very believable. Nice job
I totally get it now lol
* Hears about war flashbacks to little mermaid levels*
* shivers*
I have kindom of hearts 3
Micky is as evil as Walt Disney
I feel like the force feeding was the best option...
i just completed kingdom hearts back in really early april and thought something was not right in the frozen world
"Fall into despair" 'Black and white'


Damn, I'm too invested in Danganronpa.

Edit: WOAH 117 likes?!?! Thank you sooo much everyone! Glad to see many people know Danganronpa here XD 

Let's hope Matpat tries it too soon!
Always love the theories, usually don't believe them. Having played this world myself i think you are actually 100% on this one man.
Love this idea
Even if this had happened we still would have been stuck with a mountain no arendelle at all still a very short level still very disappointing
I'm realizing we never faced a couple villains 

Beauty and the Beast villain

Pirates of the Caribbean villain

Toy Story 1& 3 villain

Big Hero 6 villain

Not to also mention we didn't revisit worlds
Disney cut it to hide the entrance to the secret Zoo Level!
first. beautiful theory.
second....who else thought this was gonna be about Elsa being gay because of the give Elsa a girlfriend campaign and mattpat was gonna bring up axle and roxses that Disney wouldn't let be together as proof?
just me? 
understandable
In my opinion it could've been fixed, still with the level cut entirely out, that when Anna sacrificed herself to save Else, something inside Elsa snapped making her go AWOL and become the Ice Wolf thingimajiggy. When Marshmallow, Sora and co. stop it, causing Marshmallow to sacrifice himself; thus making Else come to her senses.


Ding dong, level solved. Disney, bring me my paycheck.


Also; about the labyrinth, just give us a cutscene of Larxene just magic-ing the labyrinth or her saying after a black screen: "Let's see you get out of this".
My baby KH3 is my fav game (besides fnaf)
i knew that the change that disney made to frozen would eventually bite it in the butt. Sad to see that KH had to suffer to do it

Oh well, just a bad world.
Yeah when I played the game I noticed on the map there was a lot more to the frozen palace.I thought to myself it's either cut content or future DLC. But it's much more likely it's cut content... Unfortunately. What a disappointment. They had so many years to prepare and yet it still feels like the game was rushed. there were so many moments in the game where I felt like details were missing. As if there was a complete product and the developers accidentally dropped it into a shredding machine and scrambled to put the remains back in chronological order. And we got the leftovers
Not all anime hair is spikey only yugioh and all it's meme
That would‚Äôve been so much better
i love these intros
Organisation 13‚Ä¶ is this a reference to section 31?
This theory makes way, way, way, WAY more sense than the stupid "sleeping realm" theory. I definitely wish we'd had this. :/
Oh no evil Micky... He's back and he's breaking eggs and forcing mushrooms üò±
or what if hans is secretly a furry which is why he's a ice wolf
I wish they would‚Äôve kept it, because every person struggles with darkness and what better message than to say, ‚ÄùYou‚Äôre normal, and you can still become a hero,‚Äù rather than, ‚ÄùYou must be perfect.‚Äù
I Love The Quiet This Theory!
MatPat I think you are absolutly right about this theory. It makes so much sense and personally I would love to have seen this in the game. It could have shown Elsa's charecter in a whole new different light but in a good way by showing to chidren that you can come back from even the darkest of moments.

Disney is their own worst enemy they missed out on a brilliant story arch here. I kinda understand why they didn't let this happen as they probably were concerd that it would destroy Elsa's character, but actually it would have added to her character and made us excited at what she can do when she really choses to LET IT GO.
i think larxene made the ice maze beacuse its DISNEY not the real world where everything needs to make sense..
U smartest of all smart
üê≠isüòà
The theory does make sense and would make a much better story than what we got.  I can't say I remember particularly hating that world though.  It wasn't my favorite world, but there are some good things to redeem it:
1) no "ice physics" making you slide all over the place 
2) Pretty to look at
3) Fun to goof around in, especially when you activate flowmotion
4) The final boss for the world didn't fit well with the story and made no sense, but darn was it a fun fight
I‚Äôm so sorry matpat. Please don‚Äôt tell me you understand the plot. 

bc then you‚Äôre too far gone
A new fnaf teaser image is out!
Given how the entire movie was based on Elsa overcoming her inner demons, she absolutely could have become Heartless as per the lore of KH.
Maybe they took it out because SOMEWHERE in the lore it contradicted something
That intro tho
Game Theory and Film Theory released at the exact same time. Ok, now this is epic.
Darn.......
Can we get a fan made versio- oh wait. Disney. Copyright. Man......
Can you make a naruto theorie? :3
Well I couldn't tell why I hated this level, but I think you hit it on the head. Censored stages.
I love this theory soooo much!!!!!
KH3 was terrible because of a lot of these reasons too.
there goes another corner on my "Likes Disney" card
Please do another theory on this please!!!
Matpat: shows what WAS going to be in game 
Disney: starts sweating
see‚Äôs Mickey ThiS gOn BE gUd
This is so good. I honestly didn't even pick up on how disjointed this is because I couldn't stop laughing at the sudden insert of Let It Go with Sora in the background, but this video made me REALLY REALLY wish that we could have had this level like it should have been...
Don't like Game Theory at all, but this... this just makes too much sense and there's no way you can convince me otherwise. I knew Disney meddled with the Frozen world quite a bit but not to this extent.


Also, I hear the comment section is a great place to find ingredients. If you see some let me know.
How does bowser teleport in the 3D games
MatPat: uploads two videos with ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù in the title at once on two separate channels
Theorists: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!
Dang this explains why this map was really boring.
This makes a lLOT of sense. The only hole i noticed is that Marshmellow can't get inside the ice castle after the level ends. But maybe he would only join at the end again, on this different level
Anytime Mickey is in game theory is a good time
Climb a mountain to get knocked back down huh that sounds like looney toons
Double upload? Don't believe me? Go to film theory
Re make I call for a remake!!!!!
Speaking of Scott...
Speaking of Scott...
i ship giorno and elsa now
I feel cheated now. This would've been a MUCH BETTER Arendelle.
why does your mickey sound more like the original than the one they used in KH?
I guess donald and goofy joined mickey's side. pats matpat on the back sorry man, if there's any disney characters that liked you, i'll let you know
i also thought that the world felt weird....and i thought there might be sth in the 3 rooms in the labyrinth.....that was weird too.
regarding the stupid mountain climbing... i thought : ''really? Again?'' ....that was a not written very well.

 i also thought that the appearances of the organization felt weird in the different worlds...they mostly just talked with us and disappeared after that.
lol I love this mini mickey film. by the way Disney was my fav channel to watch on tv
You know it's a good video when Mickey is in it....üëå
The level we deserved
Well now micky is evil agin
The opening shows who the real villain was the whole time.
I drawed elsa as an organization 13 member
this would have been so cool if it made it into the game damn it disney.
In the game where is Mikey he not with his friends
this is one theory i agree with
There is a lot of reaching here lol
Covering kh lore.how was This not longer
I would've liked a scene where Larxene has girl talk with Elsa. But Larx had a point - it was none of Sora's business.
Down with mikie 1
Wish this is what we got instead. Arendelle was the worst kingdom hearts world outside of atlantis
12:58 - 13:11 Damn, it almost feels like she's screaming help despite repressing that call for help
Do a theory on donkey  kong junior
They should of did Black Couldron instead, even Disney isn't attached to that masterpiece
SJW Disney ruins everything
Matpat's theories have taught me a valuable lesson, always fear Mickey Mouse.
this is a bloody sick theory
Has anyone notice the batim axe?
Ok I love the Game Theory intro, but isn't it about time Sora cameo'ed in (:
Maybe Frozen 2 would bring more light to why that stage was lacking üòÖ
7:58 elsa dabbing someone call the po po
Sora, what about Olaf?
Pss matpat is Mikey mouse keeping you in cell ( You Can tell us )
Sora defeats elsa
Elsa thinks of her wrong ways
Elsa becomes good
She‚Äôs so she can give life without giving brith
You think the portal is wierd? Well the plot of KH 3 is to safe terra, aqua, ven, and bring roxas' heart back. Nobodies doesnt even have hearts. And where did xion come?!
Skip to 11:00, the first half is buildup.
Honestly thought about buying it,, but after hearing the review on thissss...
Holy chizz if they left that in id love Elsa even more! showing that conflict would have made her even more human
Mat pay you are a smart aren‚Äôt ya it amazing
I love how mickey is basically an official character on here now
is that Arin Hanson as mickey?  he is really good at that
So Elsa transforms into Garurumon. Interesting.
MatPat‚Äôs Mickey voice is straight up just Monokuma.
matpat kill mouse with your keyblade
Mickey crazy Conffirm like raisins XD
screw what we got, I like this.
This is an absolutely amazing theory. One of the best you done recently, it makes so much sense. Well done. Clap and a half for you!
I'm pretty sure Corona also had a LOT of cut areas. If you look there are very fleshed out paths that are simply blocked by trees, but if you look at the map structure vs the way they normally structure such things, it's the same as the funnel that normally pushes you into the "exit" for that part of the map.
Unrelated to all of this. I have one thing to say.. GOOD LUCK ON YOUR NEXT FNAF THEORY! :DD
Very plausible but I think it‚Äôs just Hans true personality of him being a wolf. Eg he‚Äôs a wolf in sheeps clothes type thing.
Larxene saying: ice isnt really my thing while creating an ice dungeon is definitely not nomura putting shade to disney
 and giving clues to the fans that this isnt what the frozen world would have looked like.
With Elsa being everywhere 6 YEARS after her movie coming out, she is without a doubt a villain.
Came for ridiculous, unfounded fan theory; stayed because... yeah... this literally makes sense.
How dare you make complete sense! Now I dislike this game even more!
I was shock at the start like "wth this turn into anime" and it's just an ad ....
Do the theory on where you think what happened to sora, or if he even existed in the first place. Please. It keeps me up at night.
This image Matpat has of Disney is just solid gold and I want to frame it on my wall.
Ah Micky Mouse my mortal enemy
That makes a thousand times more sense
Before now the Square Enix characters were protecting you from the disney ones... Not anymore... Mickey will make EVERYONE eat those mushrooms now!
one day Disney will buy this channel
Not only did the dark ice palace maze coming from Larxene make sense, but the maze seemed to scream ice witch from Narnia (even matches the design from the 1st Narnia movie). Even Larxene says "ice is SO not my style."
Does anyone else adore the "supervillain Mickey" character that the Theorists created?
Brubrubrubrubruhhhhh
Este foi o pior video de sempre
Corporate meddling strikes again.
11:15 YES!! \o/ Thank you Matt & team; I'm so happy others thought this too!

That stupid Ice Labyrinth's existance also makes actual sense if Elsa made it and not LIGHTNING based Larxene; plus if Larxene is powerful enough to create THAT then there's NO way Sora and gang could beat her.
That Labyrinth is end game, Xehanort levels of power.
This is better then the kh level
Micky mouse is gonna getcha
GDI, stopped the video at 0:08, was going to close the tab, but then I read the other comments. So I had to see what the fuss was about.
This makes me angry.
Wait! What if frozen 2 is a story about Elsa discovering her powers and surrendering to the power of good,not lost in Canada!
Well I couldn't make it past 3:10
Too bad they scraped the original story line
This feels right
I understand the possible controversy but like, can't there be a redemption arc?? It shows with Marshmallow.
God dammit I hate companies sometimes. I want to swear. I want to swear so so bad.
Can we collaborate?
BRO I THINK YOUR RIGHT
Hand is a furry, that is why the ice wolf boss is there.
this makes so much sense
‚Äú...in the movie‚Äù

Shows clip from game

Good job MatPat
1 star because I thought this was a theory not facts
Oh man another ball dropped damn it :/
4:27 Hey! That's me!
Omg makes sense
Mickey just doesn‚Äôt give you a break, does he?
Anybody else pissed that matpat made a better game level than the kingdom hearts people? I'm actually ready to fight some people over some bullshit that might not be true but makes more sense than the bullshit they gave us.
Disney want to know location
Disney is gonna rule the world
To be honest these games are basically glorified crossovers
Sora and Kairi: "Riku."
Riku: "Huh?"
Sora and Kairi: "Do you wanna build a snowman?"
Riku: "You guys are nerds."
I think frozen exists purely for the ice and the ice keyblade
Micky and the matt machine
So I'm know I'm pretty late to this but I hear you've got in trouble for basically not giving a link to a game called heartbound. This triggered me because w
You don't HAVE to give links out though its frowned upon.
kh3 was just a fail!!
I disagree with the idea of a controversy for an evil princess.
Woman aren't always sugar spice and everything nice, sometimes they can be cold as ice



Hey Disney!  Feel free to use that!
Wow Matpat wrote a better level than square
I thought the trolls were the villains
This is what I've wanted and had been fanficing ever since Frozen came out! I can't believe they just gave us an unskippable Let It Go sequence. Waste of time. Waste of space in the game files
So are you going to finish that kirby theory? It definitely had my attention.
13:01 wHOoP I didn‚Äôt know this was madoka magica!
Me and my brother adore this series, we own all the games, but I get stuck ALL the time and always need his help.
You‚Äôd make a good villian someday. üòê
I feel like ur right
Man you smart
Record your Mickey impression next time so we can get some behind the scenes footage of MickeyPat.
I like this theory. Good to see you're back to making some smart content.
My eyes have been opened
Love the series, hope they do better with the next one...but honestly this game was disappointingly short. I almost didnt realize i had finished it by the time i did. And what a "f you" that was...after years of waiting and promises of more worlds than ever...hell even if they had more worlds than ever they were each only about 30 minutes long -.-
I thought you were talking about the frozen slider minigame...
3:03 help
It could've been chill, but Disney melted it. (I'm bad at ice puns.) Nitrogen didn't want to bond, but Oxygen said NO2 that it's not even my joke
Hope someone make a mod for these game
4:09
It also doesn't help that they even accidentally left a watermark in during the Let it Go sequence.
I love Marshmellow
This was a great episode
I  just saw the title
1:06
Thank you MatPat. You have redeemed yourself with this theory and I really enjoy it. Keep up the good work.
Thought I was the only one, the whole world felt off.
helllo world!
A point to support this theory is that their is a full mini map of elsa's ice castle
Micky u ok?
Yes Donald, the sewer is indeed the best place to find ingredients
This makes so much sense!
0:30 I thought he would starve him until he ate it
This story is much better than what they used in the game
Roses are red violets are blue I got clickbaited and so did you ( btw I know stole this comment if I knew who made it I would have gave credit give credit)
Disney has gone insane







Well, they have a long time ago
3:09 oh no stock photo guy got norted
Where's infinity war cause disney helped make infinity war
There is a story about internal conflict we like to tell about a wise, old Cherokee American Indian. There are many versions of this story and they can vary slightly in details, but the moral of the tale is the same.

A group of Cherokee children gathered around their grandfather. They were filled with excitement and curiosity. That day, there had been quite a tumultuous conflict between two adults and their grandfather was called in to mediate.

The children were eager to hear what he had to say about it. One of the children popped a question to the grandfather that was puzzling him.

‚ÄúGrandfather, why do people fight?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äù the old man replied ‚Äúwe all have two wolves inside us, you see. They are in our chest and these wolves are constantly fighting each other‚Äù.

The eyes of the children had grown big by now.

‚ÄúIn our chests too, grandfather?‚Äù asked another child. ‚ÄúAnd in your chest too?‚Äù asked a third one.

He nodded, ‚ÄúYes, in my chest too. He sure had their attention now. The grandfather continued. ‚ÄúThere is a White Wolf and a Black Wolf. The Black Wolf inside us is filled with fear, anger, envy, jealousy, greed, and arrogance. The White Wolf is filled with peace, love, hope, courage, humility, compassion, and faith. They battle constantly‚Äù.

Then he stopped. The child that asked the initial question continued. ‚ÄúBut grandfather, which wolf wins?‚Äù

The old Cherokee simply replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs simple‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the wolf we feed the most.‚Äù

That's why she is the wolf!
Is there any more petscop coming or is it over now?
Circa 2019: Matpat uniting gamers against the corporations of society
That  would have been a cool level if elsa was the villain
Matpat's getting lazier
There‚Äôs even more evidence to back up this theory. After you beat each world and go back to explore you can find a seemingly unused room or space that was probably intended for a boss fight. I think it was more than just Elsa. I think most of the characters were supposed to lose their hearts to darkness only for Sora and co to help bring them back. In Thebes there is a huge unused room I think was supposed to be a space for the fight with Herc. I‚Äôm still exploring the worlds but this is the most accurate theory I‚Äôve seen so far! üëçüèæüëèüèæ
INGREDIENTS
This theory reminds me of the time we found the location and the secret coffee shop in Smash! 

Hey Reggie, now that you're retired, you should join Matthew for a cup of coffee üòâ
15:37 you missed the opportunity to say ELSAwhere
It's already pretty obvious that there was something wrong with the Frozen level. But to discard a story that would ultimately make Frozen a more engaging experience while expanding on the characters in such a way that they'll end up even more sympathetic and liked, for the current boring mess. Wouldn't that just tell to the uninitiated that Frozen is over-hyped and a throw away movie instead?


I would have kept the engaging story since it would bringing more people into the fold.


PD: I'll just note it down on more executive meddling.
This just makes sense.
The world they cut out from the game was the mysterious tower u can clearly see this in the trailers they had it in the game they don‚Äôt they also said that they cut out mysterious tower
Still remember Aqua's original design...her entire back exposed. 
THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR THEM KIDS.
Holy... Ok, show of likes! Who else thinks this guy needs to be on the Kingdom hearts Writing team?!
I  knew it was bulshit that I couldn't go into the castle.
who else thinks the game theorists have the best theme song thing
I have a theory, an outsider who's never played the game theory! I think that Disney got rid of the original Mickey mouse, donald, and goofy in the kingdom hearts world so he wouldn't to against them. So the dark organization is partnered with disney!!!!!!!!!!!!! That would explain why Mickey is a total badass
0:24 Mickey Jumpscare
I drew Elsa as an organization 13 member
so at 18:40, you're telling me that someone was writing this script and DIDN"T write "Sometimes, it's best to just let it go..." instead of not meddling? 0/10 writing
very good analysis. I agree.
That MM voice acting is spot on in a terrifying way... yeeesh gets in my skin!
the big company Disney meddled with the storyline in turn creating a much weak and lamer one..now where did i saw this..hmmm....oh right Warnerbros to DCEU..terrfying!
This is a very good theory. Makes much more sense then the world in the game. To be honest, it was my least liked world. This might be why.
I didn‚Äôt think Hans deserved an amazing heartless but now, JUST WOW ! It‚Äôs Elsa who gets some huge fricking ice beast.
wow mat pat you done good on this one.
Dude this fits so well. It ticks me off that they didn‚Äôt use this as a throwback to the original script of the movie. 

I know they were trying to protect Elsa‚Äôs reputation..but still. I hate it when stuff like this happens in such a beautiful video game like Kingdom Hearts. Phack Disney And Elsa‚Äôs reputation...That would have been a cool AF level and storyline.
he is slender hans
Studio might've been afraid of media backlash-



"Kingdom Hearts 3 Sexist: Queen Elsa made a villain, then saved by a man. Interview with creators this Friday."


But hey that's just a theory
This also makes sense when you look at Sora and what Kingdom Hearts has done in the past.
Don't get me wrong. Sora is very kindhearted and well meaning, but he's also kind of a highly trusting idiot. He tends to swing first and ask questions later. So if Hans came up to him was was like, "Yo, there's an Ice Witch terrorizing our people, watch out!" and then Sora came across the "evidence" of that Ice Witch (Elsa's Golems), he might think "That's gotta involve the Heartless! Imma smash it wit ma key!" and go to town. (KH protags are very prone to being tricked. See Terra and Xehanort from BbS)



But of course, THIS is where Disney would go "My Brand!" and step in when EA is pulling  worse bullshit over at their little hellhole. Typical.
This is the closest we are getting to see a bad/evil Elsa.
Why didn't they call it organization A113

Missed opportunity
What's Mat's problem with Mickey Mouse? Did I miss something?
Now we know who stalled KHIII
How about Lego Bionicle lore
Imagine how well KH3 might have been if only Disney didn't prod so much for how they wanted their stuff to be represented in the game. It'd probably do them much better if they didn't force-shove things down throats in the way they do.
The real Arendelle level is the final tenth that completes Kingdom Hearts 3, it'll be dlc 0.1 that will be added to 2.9 to make 3.
0:03 Donald Duck
mickey mouse.exe xd
I‚Äôll never look at Mickey the same
Reached yesterday arendelle.^^
Fun Fact: It's been confirmed Arendelle was supposed to be a musical world like Little Mermaid but the Devs talked Nomura out of it.
1:06 If mickey mouse was hentai
I had know idea what was happening at the start
Ok matpat is back
3 huge (Broadway) disney musicals, I was pretty sure you meant Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King. But what do I know...
I hope the developers confirm this theory
I haven't played Kingdom Hearts but I probably will now
So Why was MatPat at the Stadia presentation?
Disney didn't want to let it go.  Thanks for the theory!
Nice Video üëå
1:00 what does disney think about how you show the mouse?
I thought Matpat would have PTSD from the phrase ‚Äúgive life‚Äù
Matpat: the person destroying mickey mouse with showing his greed and theories.
Iv never played Kingdom Hearts... I‚Äôm not interested in seeing it. Why am I here and why am I enjoying this?
MAT YOU JUST UPLOADED FBAF VID BUT THEN TAKE IT DOWN WHERE IT GO I NEED MORE FNAF!!!!
I want this
17:44

MaPat, please tell your editors to
adjust their fanart accordingly
See, I never think of inconsistencies like this when playing games, but even I caught/thought it was weird that her castle was on the map but you couldn't actually go in.
DAMN.. i blame disney :/ why wont u let square do what they do best T.T aaaaaaaah asdfasf
15:39 don‚Äôt you mean Elsawhere.   







Yes I live in my moms basement
So basically MatPat stole a theory from /khg/ on 4chan. That he did not write. I know this because the very first instance of it on the entire known internet is when I wrote it in an analysis of the game on the website when it was released in Japan. And because nobody on Youtube would ever actually admit to browsing 4chan in 2019, he gets free views off of it.


I expect a public apology and admission that you ripped an idea from 4chan.
Regardless of  how true or not, this sounds like a massive improvement to what thet actually released...
That would have been really awesome to see!
So what i'm hearing here is MattPat is Mickeys Bich :)
It would have been awesome if Elsa was the final boss of the level. And I mean come on we all know that KH3 was not targeted at a young audience, so it's not like it would have made a difference if Elsa were the final boss
Not sure if anyone has mentioned it but, from what I heard, it was the song "let it go" that made writers change elsas roll from a Villain to hero...ish character. Because the song sounded more empowering than villainous.
If it‚Äôs anything like the water temple then I‚Äôm glad I can‚Äôt play it
How much do you have to love yourself to say "The smartest show in gaming"?
You know whats interesting?









I think.
I am just confused on why Disney wanted to take this out when it honestly would of followed the main points from the movie about Elsa. Elsa could have actually of been a bad person in the movie if it wasn't for her sister always wanting to help her. There were a lot of people in the movie that became scared of her and saw her as a villain. But with the power of love, she was able to overcome her negative thoughts and show everyone that she was good all along. 
I don't see how this would of messed up her image to children. Isn't it good to teach them that not everything is black and white? Characters/People, even those that kids look up to, should show that there are conflicting thoughts and actions that they must go through to determine who they want to be. People just don't start out as good or bad. Take Meg from Hercules for example. As a role model for young children, I feel like showing Elsa coming out on top of darkness would show them that is is OK to fall, but getting back up again is what makes you strong (a hero/heroine).
FYI: Kingdom Hearts II.9 is the Hercules level: once that's done, it switches to Kingdom Hearts III (as shown by the opening theme). And yeah, the Frozen level was lame AND I completely gave up on the stupid cooking mini-game.
On Kingdom Hearts 4 they should have an evil Mickey like at the beginning of this theory.
I'm named after Kairi!
Why is mickey so evil?!! I‚Äôm sad! You ruined Disney for me ;-; OH WELL THATS JUST A THEORY
11:47 I just noticed she looks like All-Might
You know what? I can get with this for sure. Someone needs to actually ask Nomura about this. It makes complete sense for Elsa being the villain.
Disney messed with whole game because the non-pixar worlds are pretty lackluster from a story and level design  perspective
JACK SPARROW
I guess I don't really mind the censorship now because...it would have partially undone Elsa's character arc solely for dramatic purposes to tell a thematically identical story - only with more ham and less depth.
17:46 She can give gifts, give life
This has to be true
Mickey has something against matpat!! It's a constant battle with each other
At this point matpats elsagate
i have nightmares now
First, Disney took all the credit from the Fleischers, now Disney ruins a perfectly good story plot, with a good ending that would teach people a lesson, and for many to enjoy. Not everything has to be as they are. Twists are more interesting.
I feel robbed of a very good game level.
This would have been the best level in the whole damn game.
Well presented
Yeah... If that was the case I would have bought Kingdom Hearts 3/2.9
And I know I shouodn't concider due to 1 pevel out of 3 or more games.
But if Disney are the ones that calling the shots.
And do the enternal good kind of story instead of true genuine and inner conflicts characters... I'm not gonna buy it.
I mean kingdom heart lore seems pretty messed up... but FNAF allow us to see genuiniy in all Characters.... 
That is why the Star Wars Disney movie is so bad, they aren't making anything new, most lore or scenes are based on previous movie. And tge characters overall feel to much holiwoody, Sorry Disney not gonna happen.
0:10 goofy comes out of the water
I thought this was üòè
You know this channel is amazing when you can watch theories on games you've never played a day in your life and still be intrigued.
dang wish that Disney stayed out of this and let the developers do what they want to do. This theory makes for a really good story, instead of this mess that was slapped together.
Tragically (
Hopefully will save 20 minutes of jargon
The movie frozen had Elsa the big bad originally, but they changed the script after they heard let it go song.(no reference to this in the theory i saw)
Square saw demos before the movie was released, probably rolled with an old version with elsa as big bad.
Movie changed, had to scrap everything and add filler because it didn't fit...
boom
Look at 9:37 lol
Oh god not the eggs... NOT THE EGGS!!!
I would‚Äôve loved that so much more
Ang landi ng babae dun sa ad ng mobile legends
Yeah.... I don't think MatPat will ever get a Disney sponsor again.
this honestly sounds WAY BETTER than the level we actually got.
You'd think that maybe a better level would act as better marketing for a sequel or something, even if it doesn't totally agree with said sequel it could just be seen as an alternate timeline.
The end...Puzzle Over, LeTS BuBBLe BObbLe WITH WHineY ThE POo
This was very apparent, i‚Äôm glad someone pointed it out. Being someone who loved Kingdom Hearts through all of the handhelds and convoluted story, I have to say that the one thing that let me down was the Final Fantasy character being left out and the over-all difficulty being non-existent. Other than that getting Platinum Trophy on KH3 was fun and worth my time but please bring us Critical mode and some seriously difficult DLC. Good Theory Matt Pat
...
Actually...This is a very good theory. That make me sad for Square because yeah. Arandelle. Is. A. FAILURE. I've hate all about this world except the labyrinthe because it was fresh, all the rest is just the movie with Sora in it =/ But thanks to you, Iwill now look to that world for what it could has been and not for what it is <3
as this is just a theory, and it sounds very convincing, i'd rather than have just taken the level out and scrapped the entire world instead of leaving what they did in, was almost complete waste of time
It really pisses me off that disney was so difficult and caused the world to be so bland and disappointing, if Nomura could have done what he originally planned (assuming this theory is true) It would have been SO MUCH better. And probably would have been my favorite world.
this theory is so obviously fake, Disney is the greatest company in the world and would never do something like that. The level was intended to be this way and is absolutely perfect (5 dollars have been added to your Paypal account, please remove this part of the message.)
Matpat's arch nemesis Mickey Mouse. Sad really.
This might be a good spot to find some ingredients
Mat vs micky
When I first saw the trailers for KH3 frozen I assumed she was going to be the villain. I was extremely confused when I got to that part of the game.
Well technically about Hans being a wolf clearly makes since because he wants to be a leader he wants to be in charge a wolf that's in charge is called an alpha Hans being a wolf clearly means he wants to be the alpha
Just send your cat after Mickey, matpat
This story arc would also semi follow Rikus story ark of going evil and then returning to the light
And im altso on the Frozen level
1:42 
Mat Pat: ‚ÄúThe deep lore of Kingdom Hearts is so complex, that Scott Cawthon‚Äôs story telling seems pretty straightforward‚Äù






Kirby fans: Allow us to introduce ourselves
In one of the conversations with Larxene isn't it stated that Elsa is one of the new princesses of heart? If that's the case, then by the games own canon Elsa's heart would pure light and completely devoid of darkness which kinda throws a wrench in this whole theory.
sounds like i wont like this one :( so glad i didn't end up buying this game
I can totally imagine Elsa having a Riku moment and Sora could say something "I have a friend who is in a similar situation and blah blah blah" to help her
The same thing kinda also happened to Oswald. Disney, for whatever reason, denied the game developers to implement him into the story. He would‚Äôve been a really good anti-hero, and I would‚Äôve loved to see him battle with his brother!
Nice summery
Kingdom Hearts 3 was a terrible game, with no right to even claim to be a sequel to KH2, and the Frozen level was truly one of the worlds the franchise has ever seen. Assuming this is correct, this would make the world actually good, and more similar to the worlds from past games. I would actually love if this theory is correct as it would make such a terrible game even somewhat bearable.


Also, I hate it when people say the KH story is complicated, because it really isn't. The problem is that there is just SO MUCH story, especially revolving around Xehanort, that people say it is complicated. As long as you can just accept that in Kingdom Hearts, a persons heart is a totally separate their body, then it is a really simple story to follow. Also, as long as you forget KH3's story happened since it ACTUALLY tried to make things complicated and annoying. Even the time travel was easy and simple in Dream Drop Distance, but then KH3 made it difficult again. Can you tell I hate KH3?
We need to see a showdown between matpat and Mickey
You think it's funny but I would absolutely watch a 20 hour Mauler level dissection of Kingdom Hearts.
evil Mickey is so evil.
My name is kairi
OH NO DISNEY IS CALLING THE FBI TO ANYBODY WHO WATCHES
I thought the Ariel levels were fun, but kind  of hard.
The level was scrapped because no one wanted to climb anymore mountains.
It's so sad when something like this happens because the end product does feel messy and unfinished, and it doesn't really fall back onto Disney but the game creators when ultimately it is Disney's fault.
I thought it said toohoot for Disney
I speculate that why the Frozen world ended up being just so messy, in addition to your theory that it was salvaged from scraps of a different version of Arendelle, is Disney made them change it AFTER Square had already announced Frozen for KHIII. 
Once you promise something like that to your buyers, you can‚Äôt really take it away. Especially something like FrozenXKHIII.

I definitely would believe Frozen‚Äôs original world was fleshed out and wonderful and fit the game- especially since what we have now is so DIFFERENT from any other world in the series. When they scrapped Jungle Book for BBS, they didn‚Äôt try to salvage a tiny lazy world, they just got rid of it all together even though they had already put a lot of work into it. They wanted Ariel to be a princess of heart, but it wouldn‚Äôt work with her whole mermaid tail, so they changed it to Alice- that was still clean and made sense in the final game. 

Frozen is messy, but not lazy, which is a tell-tale sign of something that got cut up a bunch and just inserted little sprinklings of the original. 


I was telling my mom, ‚ÄúSquare should release what they originally had for Frozen as a free DLC, that way Disney can‚Äôt be mad for Square getting profit from that story line‚Äù. But I know Disney cares about reputation as well. Ugh.
Whatever
This has been the most believable theory since 5-stages-of-grief-Majora's-Mask
tjis level coud be so much better screw disney ......
Imagine Elsa's reaction when Sora shows him using magic to her when they first meet & making a friend that can use magic like her.
Where Kirby?
Wow just wow
but wasn't the kirby part 2 episode supposed to be today? ;-;
Maybe expose these things?
- Why did Luxord pass Sora a card and state it could turn the tides of the battle for Sora and then not reference it ever again?
- Why is it that Xemnas destroyed Axel's blade and explained that it meant Axel was no longer a warrior of light because it was gone forever only to then have Axel randomly turn up in a later cutscene with the same keyblade?
- Why is it that when Axel's Keyblade broke he just randomly got it back but when Riku's broke he needed a new one?
- Why did I have to fight the same boss seven times in a row?
- Why did I only visit each world once?
- Why was there no FF characters?
- Why did they cheapen each defeat of an organization member by turning them into good guys when they lost, even Ansem?
- Why did they make there THREE Riku's in a story that's already saturated with four Sora look-alikes?
- Why was there no Sephiroth?
- Why was the game even MORE childish than the previous?
- Why was it so easy?
- Most importantly, why did I buy this terrible game?
I like community nowadays always make mickey mouse evil and equals to joker. We need disney injustice....
Honestly, it‚Äôs pretty condescending that Disney thinks that even their younger audience wouldn‚Äôt be able to grasp a theme like ‚Äúa bad influence can corrupt a person with both light and dark in their heart, but a good influence can bring them back‚Äù, especially when that‚Äôs a theme that anyone who‚Äôs played these games has already been hammered over the head with since the beginning. If they weren‚Äôt gonna let the KH team tell a story with even that much edge, they should have just said ‚Äúno‚Äù from the beginning.
Who else thought that the egg cracking mini game was way too hard? Also, FRICKIN FRED SUCKS FROG!!!!
The person doing the micky mouse voice over is actually doing a great job! Just wanted to appreciate them!
yo its snowing outside wtf is this sorcery
Please  make a theory about the walking dead the game
But kids those ages don't play KH3!! Stupid Disney.
Hay Mat I was revising the fnaf series and realized something who is the pony haired girl you thought was originally baby I want to know if she is important to the series or if she is the a fun Easter egg and I‚Äôm asking because I think your smart enough to figure it out. If you read this and do a vid on it that would be amazing
Honestly, I'd say that the most times meddling isn't a great thing.  Creative flexibility is important.

Personally, I think I blame this mostly on the issue that people/brands/etc have with portraying women (or women role models) as both good and evil.  For example, take the Star Wars movies and how there's very very little depth, and how powerful (with no practice) she is.  Captain Marvel toned it down a bit, but it's still there.  There are also other examples, too.  There are examples where companies can portray women in conflicting roles.  I recently watched "The Order" from Netflix, and the warewolf girl is one of my favorite characters in that show.  She's a tomboy, in a sense, but she has a lot of depth and actually gets proven as being "wrong" in some cases.  Overall very aggressive, has faults, but also makes great decisions and sacrifices in the show.  An overall excellent character, and one of my favorites from that show.

Which is really unfortunate.  People can be role models without being "perfect". They're role models due to how relateable  they are as characters.  This level would have been a lot better if it turned out as you said - with Elsa being a relateable, and honestly great character.  I found her overall very empty in this level, and out of the game (as so far as I played), this level is definitely the weakest I've done.  I'm not much further from that level though, so maybe there's a worse one.  I don't know.  I agree with you it felt a fair amount out of place, and a lot could have been done to improve it.
it makes sense that elsa is the ice wolf
this makes me so very angry. not because of you, Matpat, you're amazing. but that the cowards at Disney Corporate couldn't understand that Elsa's character would only become stronger & more beloved if she had to overcome her darkness. after all, that's what she did in her movie too.
I wish so much this was the frozen world. So much! Especially since the Ice queen they based Elsa on was evil. Would have been so more fun
Well if disney lets them do this in the next eternity maybe it could be dlc
... So, what you're saying is one of the most forgettable worlds in KH3 could have been one of the best?

... Thanks for screwing up, Disney....
This is no doubt 100% on point !
Frozen level was soo awkward and empty.
The only cool thing to happen was finish the level and get the keyblade 
The several climbs up the mountain were stupid and the obvious Elsa maze castle that had nothing in it made it painful to see all the potential wasted
Hi
All I see is all might with her hair tho omfg
‚ÄòClap‚Äô
Crack that egg!
Over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER
donlad and goofy fight a bloodthirsty ice monster , ok then disney
This is maybe the last video with animated Content From him.
They made Dark Rapunzel, so why no dark Elsa.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if Nomura commented to this video with a 
‚ÄúVery well done‚Äù! 
That would be cool.
The playthrough for this world was confusing in its entirety. The theory fits into the worlds playthrough and I was questioning this myself. The ice wolf seemed a better fit for elsa. And the deongeon was confusing. So much so that I didn't even bother with that room of enemies at the end.
Haven‚Äôt played the game (or any in the series) but this theory and it‚Äôs evidence makes so much sense to me.
Mat if this going like ƒ±ll have to nuke Disney in fallout 76
I hated that cooking game
Disney Shuts idea for a PEGI 12/ESRB 10+ just to keep marketing Elsa as a female role model to girls younger than 9 year olds, who probably don't know what a playstation even is.
Soo cringy.
your mickey mouse sounded like monokuma
Mat pat is right, Elsa would make a good villain in the game seeing that Buzz was the villain in the toy story level
Wait... if they didn‚Äôt want her to be a bad guy in kingdom of hearts... maybe she‚Äôll be one in frozen 2!
WAIT WAT? I'm shook RIGHT NOW. You GET A KEYBLADE For DA COOKINg!!!???
2:58 my name is Terra.....
Actually that's what I thought would happen and I was SO disappointed tbh. Yes, I liked the world because I loved the movie. But Kingdom Hearts-wise it was a little... upsetting. I mean there is so much about choosing Light VS Darkness in KH and Elsa would be such a great contribution to it. Also, you would look more into her because even in the movie they concentrated more on Anna, her love and the love of sistership. But I wanted my ELSA-STORY damn it!!
I'm calling out mattpatt on this absurd clickbait. Just saying.
Is it wrong that I kinda liked marshmallow?
I understand why elsa had to be the good guy but, I'd rather see more villians who aren't just evil but have a reason. 
Maybe even someone who was good, but because evil due to the hero acting like a hero; which in a way, turns them into the bad guy.

Remember Gaston? The supposed "hero" of the movie? Yeah he's the bad guy. Who's the real hero? Oh it's the beast. The one you'd think is the bad guy. Blurring the lines between good and bad is not only shows characters in a new light, but it also shows there's a grey area.

Nothing is one or the other, in reality good and bad are choices people make. You aren't born to do evil things, you choose it. The same as if you want to help people; you do it. It's a choice and disney of all places should encourage this. It's your actions that make who you are.

Without those choices, Walt Disney would never of made Mickey Mouse after loosing Oswald, his first creation to a power-hungry company. The thing that sparked everything disney is today. It's not who you're born as that defines you. It's the choices you make.
Dang nabit Disney
Maybe youve already heard this but there's an native american story about two wolves. Inside everyone, there are two wolves, a light and a dark one, constantly battling. The one that will win is the one that you feed. This would explain why elsas boss form would a wolf, since that aspect always kinda threw me off. She fed into the darkness.
While I can't agree about KH's story being complicated, I agree that your idea for Arendelle is way better. It was the most odd and frustrating level I'd ever played in a KH game. The was even a scene where Sora shows his frustration about being knocked off that damn mountain so much.
I must say, I was skeptical at first, but that was quite an impressive Kingdom Hearts Theory. I was particularly intrigued by your analysis of the ice dungeon/labyrinth which was the part of the level that baffled me the most with it¬¥s weird context and empty pillar rooms.
Welp now I'm just more disappointed in the whole censoring thing just for the sake of censoring. Square had a brilliant idea and Disney just shut it down because scare and reasons. I'm really sick and tired of seeing artists getting silenced for what they do best and for doing it the best they can
Lol
I think Arandelle would have been the perfect world to give Kairi her own character arc. Have Sora drop somewhere between Frozen 1 and 2, after Larxene has already started twisting the situation to make Elsa doubt her redemption at the end of the first movie. At some point in the first act of Arandelle story, something happens, Sora is hit in the heart by an iceshard and the rest of the time you spent in the world you play as Kairi, who has come to the rescue. By having her interact with Anna and Elsa, she could have gained a deeper understanding of what Sora and Riku went through, until you get a "proof of love" (which doesn't need to be romantic) that parallels with Sora's sacrifice in Hollow Bastion in KH1. 

The core theme of Frozen was to recontextualize the original archetypes and tropes of the Princess movies. It made Anna into the driving force of the story, turning a traditionally passive role (the Princess) into an active one; and it took the role of the Witch, which has traditionally been seen in a negative light, into something much more compelling and relatable due to Elsa. In KH3, Kairi was supposed to go through a similar change, so it'd have worked really well.
honestly, i don't know what nomura was thinking, he got rid of all final fantasy, which would've been monotized by him and him alone, but instead opted for 100% disney, where he should've known his game was gonna be monotized to the point of no return
Mickey might be able to force MatPat to eat that shiitake mushroom, but Disney is the one that put a potentially great video game level about one of their most beloved movie titles down the crapper.
There could be some narrative ties of Elsa as a "lone wolf" tying into the ice wolf, but Hans could also be seen as a "wolf in sheep's clothing" I guess.  So, it fits a little bit?
Maniacal Mickey Mouse is Best Mickey Mouse
How funny, I was in Disney a couple weeks ago!
Mouse
That intro when it explained the egg cracking was super relatable. That was the most frustrating minigame out of all of the cooking minigames to do. Literally, when I did it, I never got one excellent egg cracked when I did it. I either messed up, gave up or just got ‚ÄúGood‚Äù.
Dear freakin GOD!! THAT OPENING! XD So god damn TRUUUUE!

Anyway, tbh I seriously Hated Frozen the movie already (mostly because of the ending) so being in the game I already hated it. But then they added the full song of freakin "Let it Go" AND the play was boring... i was like.. seriously.. why make me suffer more already? ..it's already in the game! 

ANYWAY (again), I wish your theory was the real story lol...why do disney destroy good things! T^T
Mickey got insane
So like sora has age most every game I thought so dose that mean due to end game videos will the next game have him still at the same age
Yikes Disney.
Pls mat pat make a theory on how many crimes peter griffin off of family guy has commited
Hey I was just replaying the game and was nearing the singing scene and goofy says "arendelle castle is so far away." Why the heck did he say that?! They were never at the castle! 
Like did disney come in a right before the game released and said 'you know, we dont want your edgy relatable Elsa because it will ruin the brand. Fix it' 'but sir we dont have the time.' 'I dont care. Fix it.'
Gdi Disney
Matpat‚Äôs Mickey Mouse impression is really shining through and they could say that evil Elsa is from a different universe
Your sources don‚Äôt say anything about Disney axed out a certain Frozen level so don‚Äôt spread false info that it‚Äôs the case.
Second, not all levels have to tie into everything with Sora, it can be like Winnie the Pooh where you don‚Äôt fight but relax with the characters.
Even Tangled doesn‚Äôt offer much in for Sora and just being a replay of the movie‚Äôs plot and just being a simple reminder of Sora‚Äôs life on his island home. That‚Äôs it.
Presonly I find marsh mellow more desirable then Olaf 
 Olaf =üí©
Marshmallow=üí™‚õÑÔ∏èüí™

Edit:thx everyone 4 the all likes!(3
I can totally get behind this theory, but this wouldn't be the first time a hero was set to be a boss fight. In kingdom hearts 1, the Genie fights alongside Jafar for a little while, just reluctantly. Maybe Elsa could've been a boss like that or something. Like she was being forced against her better judgement to attack us.
more likely that rather than it being that they didn't want her portrayed as the bad guy but that the theme of the movie overall was that women don't need a man to save them because women can save each other (or something like that) and since Sora, Donald and Goofy are all men, it would go contrary to the total theme of the original movie for them to be the one to "rescue" her from the darkness. Although I could envision a much better write-around for that even myself...
As always. Disney doesn't know why Frozen was so popular.
They basically wasted the chance to make her even more popular and likable with this plot.
But no... Why make a character who made a mistake and reform itself in a glorious and beneficial way for everyone when you can make a flawless character with no negative attribute that is boring as hell...
In no universe would Disney allow any game to portray one of their most prized characters as a villain.  Sad but unavoidable. Would have been better if they axed it earlier so at least they had time to flesh out Hans as the new antagonist somehow, or add Elsa as a party character since she was no longer evil.  And they don't care at all how bad the level turned out with all the changes. Disney don't care about KH at all.
DON‚ÄôT YOU GET IT! Remmie did something Xeonort never did. He controlled sora. Xeonort knows that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs bald.
I was playing through the ice area and just kept saying... Larx doesn't have Ice powers... This looks like Elsa's castle.... The would be better as Elsa's castle. 

I never put it together as you have here. This makes 100% since. Kind of makes me annoyed that this didn't happen because it would have been soooooooooooo amazing and added more love for the Frozen world. I'm sure Larx would be the one toying with Elsa's emotions like she was to Sora in KH:CoM. Man Disney. Man. >_<,
I honestly want to take this theory as canon. XD
17:48 as in "give gifts, give life"?
Good theory. Very believable
Mat Pat Vs. Mickey
Honestly, I thought the inside of the labyrinth was Elsa‚Äôs castle at first too and was really confused.
–¢—Ä–∞–≥–∏—á–Ω–æ (
this game took the longest to come out (about 12 years) and features the most underwhelming content. just plain sad
THE EGG JOKE WAS TO REAL. TOOOO REALLLLL
Please dont joke about mickey mouse
Free tay k
Matpat: THE FROZON LEVEL YOU WILL NEVER PLAY!! Viewers: plays it*
Im not a fan of frozen, but its sad it wasnt fully in the game...   but she would be a good role still! Disney is so money hungry sometimes.... 
I would love  a good internal strugggle and it would have made Elsa  more human!
Well, that's a shame. If this stuff had made it into the final game, i probably would've bought it even though i've never played a kingdom hearts game before.
WHAT HAPPENED TO FNAF 7
maybe kingdom hearts and disney had a fallout hence why the secret ending to kh3 didn't seem like sora was in a disney world(he could have been so correct me if im wrong) but if thats the case its possible the next kingdom hearts game won't have disney characters or worlds in it o.o i would be ok with it cause i never really played for those anyway even though im glad toy story and monsters inc were both in it. but thats just a theory.... one that is probably not true at all(if matpat mentioned this during video sorry for bringing it up i haven't gotten all the way through yet)
I think it was this way because Disney wouldn‚Äôt allow creative freedom, prove me wrong
Mickey w-w-why u bully me
so technically, disney still suck snowballs.
Disney interfering with Kingdom Hearts 3 isn't anything new. Reading interviews, it's clear Disney and Pixar had a much larger hand in the development this time around. He talks about how he and his team would actively fight with Disney and Pixar on certain characters and scenes, leading to Toy Story almost getting cut.
Man Disney always messes things up come on. She‚Äôs a Disney character it wouldn‚Äôt have ruined her image it probably would‚Äôve made her much more interesting
disney as corrupted, selfish, and greedy as ever smh
Honestly this is probably your most plausible theory in years, if not of all time.
Great job!
Hey don‚Äôt hate on marshmallow
Is there spoiler on this video
Suprised when Micky slowly goes up matpat didnt say: "oh hey a hidden Mickey!"
where is PART 2 OF KIRBY THEORY BOI GIVE IT TO ME OR ELSE
Hey game theorist are you still testing the 1.3 versions of terraria for switch and mobile??
This Is Actually
Oddly True?
That labyrinth level never made sense to me. What you just explained makes a lot of sense and puts a lot of things together. Another solid theory!
Can you do a theory about what YouTubers like me do aka 


THE GACHA COMMUNITY



is there any other gachatubers watching
I don‚Äôt how you do this but it is amazing. Hope you read this.
Wow this really makes you think... good job. TBH I really didn't like this world because you just had to climb the mountain 3 times, and were not able to enter the palace or the kingdom below (I guess they were afraid of it looking too much like Tangled). I like you idea that the ice labyrinth/dungeon is the part of or under the ice palace. Thank you for making this = ]
Well, that's a bummer...
Are you gonna theorize about Destiny 2? I feel like there is a lot of mysterious thing there. I just haven't found them yet :)
you have a problem with that mouse, isn¬¥t it?
I cant believe you didnt include the meme where goofy says "we should be safe here" then donald walks away and gets obliterated by the blizzard
Do something on showdown bandit by kindly beast
kingdom hearts add before this lol
Light or darkness huh does that sound familiar?
The snowstorm can't get us here! DONALD DUCK SCREAM
The ice creature is a girl. Thanks to the ending.
Agreed. This was the same theory I had after playing the level. The Ice Labyrinth and Hans were such obvious giveaways that these alterations were made. Also, considering they appeared to have voiced their original story, it is likely that the original is sitting on a developer's hard drive in a 100% completed state. If this is properly stored, we may see a leak of it before Kingdom Hearts 4 comes out... you know, in like 30 years.
I just realized every disney princess is flat XD
This makes... too much sense
Hey Matpat can you please make a video about Eyes the Horror game or Slenderman Thank you üôè

Mined you i have not finished the game, i was actually pretty pissed that you dint gain the power of awakening after you complete the world of Arendelle. I feel that with Elsa's ability to give create life, it would have been the perfect time to gain that ability. maybe that was also supposed to be something that got cut when they redid the level. just a vent/pondering.
My name said in japanese is Kairi
I really wish Matt Patt went back to making quality content-- Before FNAF ruined it all. It has gone from the force of a bomb omb or the real cost of a gold coin to this. I want the old game theory back, where there was science and math explaining ridiculously stupid ideas and Matt Patt simply presented it in a clean and likable manner.
I guess they "let it go"

you know the sad thing is the evil mickey is my favourite part of your Disney theories
Have you guys done a Patapon Theroies
Holy crap.... This makes so much sense....
Good lord, that would have been so much better.
the disney openings... ever feel like MatPat might have a issue with them?
they just let it go
How do u get to the level?
Sorry I love you Matt part but this isn‚Äôt theory this, sir, is fact
I really think you should stop with the evil Mickey thing, Disney is watching!
FNAF into madness is coming
Somebody needs to boundary break into Elsa's castle.
Frozen sucks anyway!
If there's ever a Kingdom Hearts III Final Mix (or a similar re-release), we know what to ask for.

NOO I AINT EATING THAT CURSE U MOUSE
Don't worry MatPat and others, I too hated the egg cracking cooking mini game!
welp... at this point we know that, Mickey, Mario and Bendy are psychopaths... WHO'S NEXT!!!
3:59  How to sum up the frozen level:
Up the mountain
 down the mountain 
up the mountain 
down the mountain 
Find the pieces of the GD  Snowman. I am losing my mind!!!
-thatgreygentleman from tiktok
video suggestion
how does strength in dark souls corespong to real life strength and whats the connection between weight in dark souls amd weight in real life
...just watched the intro.. 

Mildly confused, but amused none the less
Thumbnail: Too Hot for Disney!

Title: You Can't Play Frozen Level!
Kingdom Hearts or the Fate Franchise.
The choice is yours.
lmao!! That intro reminds me of the south park episode that had mickey mouse in it XD
This theory gave me the closure I didn‚Äôt even know I needed. Thanks matpat!
So from the theory explanation here: (if you saw the video then this isn't a curious spoiler)

- They knew about Frozen 1 and decided to add that exact copy cat  scene into the game.

-Let's go under the suggestion that the release date of kh3 was held back due to Frozen 2 trailer release date.

- What if the level is being modified to work with the new theme of frozen 2...dlc? 

I mean e3 2019 is pretty close.
1:34-1:46 




I don't blame you. Trust me, any KH fan will know just how ridiculous this lore truly is


I spent 2 hours explaining to a friend whose's barely getting into the series why Roxas and Ventus look the same... Twoooooo Hooooouuuurrssss!!!!! And I got a headache just from explaining it... >_<*
Who Else Liked The Mickey Mouse Intro And The Way The Intro Theme Started
2:52 that is clearly backstory or I AM Mickey mouse!
Hey,what about a Baldi theory? Because that seems like it'd be interesting.
OR furries :L
x-blade in greek would be pronounced heblade just so we clear
Okay, I still don‚Äôt get the hate on The Mermaid musical number, I personally like it because I enjoy timing things just right it helps
We really need to begin enforcing anti trust laws against Disney...

Nomura has said that the reason FF characters aren't in it, is that Sora and Co. can stand on their own, but isn't it just as likely that it's because Disney put a stop to it? and if the people holding the rights to the content in your game... would you speak up about it? I mean, if Sora and Co can stand on their own, why do we need two musical cutscenes?

A lot of the misdirection of KH3 can be explained away by Disney putting a stop to it, or enforcing demands. It would also explain the total dev time.
One of your better theories. Was wondering why Phil didn‚Äôt speak so thanks for that info too
Remember frozen was made to hide that Walt Diseny is frozen in- error
great video
Coming over here after watching you on Ro's channel eating candy!
Love her channel and love kingdom hearts.... so here I am :)

Very nice game theory!
I'm soooo glad you cleared this up MP! This was bothering me so much and had a few theories and suspicions myself and this just finalized it! Thank you for all you do! See you in the next theory!!!!
(Sees Mickey being terrifying) kill it! Kill it with zettaflare!!
Also side note Riku could have totally been in this level since he and Elsa are similer
This is a solid theory. As a kingdom hearts fan and theorist, I approve ^-^
Can you make a theory about apex legends bloodhound. And I want matpat, not Austin.
Nintendo made vr for labo!you were right mat pat! You smart BOY
Still waiting for a Devil May Cry theory
Sounds like a better game haha
Wow this is sad. Mat pat is relying on clickbait now.
When will you do a warframe theory?
You sound like James from Odds1sout
let OOOOOOOOOOOF LET OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF BEEJE DAN
Welp honestly, it's not insanely complex,  while there is a massive amount of lore, all the connections between characters are full of symbolism designed to hold together the crazy spider web that is "a plot". Also you are 100% right about frozen. I would look into tangled as well, that one was very similar to frozens plot
is he finished with the mushrooms yet?
Man I wish this is what happened in the game...
Hey why is matpat so obsessed with the number 7
Disney is so gonna sue you one day, MatPat.
Wow that was a theory. I remembering playing through it and by the end of the world I was going wow this was absolutely jarring compared to everything else. I also was very confused by the underground palace as well since it was the only time I can recall where they didnt stick to the story in some way. That on top of an already bland world with zero interaction with anything made it by far the most huh? Moment of the game by far. I mean they didnt even let you see the city at the end either. What a complete waste of a world. Also thanks for explaining Hercules I also was sad they didnt get Danny Devito but I didnt know the japanese voice actor passed away which now makes a lot more sense.
What is it with you and micky
One last thing to add to this AWESOME theory!
If Nomura gave a damn about the Final Fantasy characters appearing in this game (cause Lord knows he doesn't), Snow Villiers from Final Fantasy XIII could have been PERFECT in this world to appear in! And if you're familiar with Final Fantasy XIII and it's characters, then you SHOULD KNOW why he would fit perfect in this world! The world was bad enough, but after your theories, it's even worse!
So basically, what you're telling me is that Disney just couldn't...

Let it go?

Eh? Eh??
Last time we talked abou hidden levels...you gave up and said it wasn't there...
My goodness gracious that intro thoughü§£
I always felt like something was off with arendelle so this theory actually makes a lot of sense to me.
Ha! I had a strong feeling that the ice palace we were in was her palace and this makes it even moreso.
Would have been cool
This is all well and good but,  can you give me a Theory to why there is no Final Fantasy characters on this game. Is SE giving up on the franchise?
Lesson here: don't make a Kingdom Hearts game using movies that aren't finished yet.
The thing that made me so bitter regarding musical Disney world movie in KH 3 is that...Rapunzel sings a song to activated her hair power. There is a REAL REASON for her to sing. But they didn't put that gimmick into the game??? But Frozen, the song that literally just for entertainment and feels, is there?? I mean, sure, the scene was beautiful and I always love every song in Frozen, but come on, man! Tangled movie have a clear reason why the characters just burst into a song out of nowhere!
At least make it into one of Rapunzel skill or something! That she can heal if Donald decided to be a jerk and don't wanna heal us like in previous games :/
Also, this theory is really, really good! And have the potential to be 100 percent right! I've watched this vid twice already :'D
haha, I saw alpharad's play-through of this and he was like : wtf why am I in a ice castle/labyrinth out of nowhere. It was so funny, but this explains why it was so random
Man when I had to do this world I was not looking foward to it. So much that I just dragged through it, luckly a friend was with me questioning all this
It would be cool (no pun intended) if Disney released a seperate game (non-canon, of course) that had this original level. Maybe it could be dc? That way, those who actually want the new plot could play it, but those who preferred the older one could have access to it.
It all adds up:  That they had already planned on including "Frozen" from the beginning, and the original concept of the movie was that Elsa was supposed to be the villain.  They most likely had done a majority of the work on Arendelle, but due to the movie's sudden plot change, had to change the game's world as well, and the quickest way is to cut corners.  This is one theory I definitely believe.
I‚Äôve got a great idea!! ...now hear me out, what if Kingdom Hearts from now on leaves out EVERYTHING having to do with Disney?? Sure it was a cool concept back in 2001 with having Disney worlds cross over with each other, especially since the first game had much more focus on ‚Äúthe league of villains‚Äù. But I think KH can now stand perfectly on its own with only original characters. Disney has become more and more irrelevant for each installment anyway.

So, cut the ties with Disney, make KH its own thing, no Disney, no ip restrictions!
This would‚Äôve been great. 
It would‚Äôve brought the world closer to the Ice Queen fairy tale and it would‚Äôve mirrored Sora and Riku having fall to the darkness only to come back stronger by each other‚Äôs sacrifices. 
Too bad what we got was a convoluted mess with barely any story and just a cool musical number.
I love how game theory is just making Mickey mouse the villain in these videos ü§£ü§£
Do more Kingdom Hearts theories please
Since when did Mickey have a twisted soul.
And lunacy escapes natural bounds. I expected nothing less from Mickey Mouse. All his actors in Disneyland secretly never smile under the mask, as this is the result.

Don't hang with that guy, MatPat; He'll only ever try to kill us all.
The problem with this was that Disney was way too involved and only really care about how people see their IP's because of the dollar signs in their eyes. I mean in KH 1 the entire ending of Tarzan was affected by the fact that Sora and the heartless were there. This series was at its best when the OCs were made part of the Disney plots and their mere presence could completely altar some outcomes.
I LOVE the Kingdom Hearts Storyline, And I LOVE Matpat's Channel. 

This is for theorists that Love Kingdom Hearts indeed!
Mat can you please do a theory on finding out what principal brown is in the show "the amazing world of gumball" because i'd love to find out.
It is sad how statistic data and high ranked menagers have more to decide than game developers that care about the game, and player satisfaction, and not only money.
#soraforsmash
anyone else check scottgames recently, suggest checking it matpat. remember jeremy is something i found.
How can you be so stupid that you don't see the obvious 'A wolf in sheep's clothing' thing Hans had in the game? It was literally the first thing  a ton of people noticed about his fight lol
9:05 that's not how puzzle pieces work...
Is it me or at 14:17 looks like a Zelda dungeon
6:19 no NO NOOO! NOT THAT
Hate those damn mini games
Well now i'm depressed after watching this video :I
I had so much hope for this world going in but ended up being more dissapointed than any other world in the game. And it definitely felt the whole world like it was rushed and Disney really pulled out the controlling hammer on the devs the whole level. 
Here's hoping Frozen 2 is gets represented much nicely in KH4 lol.
i n g r e d i a n t s
one question. . . WHY is Micky a psychopath in the Disney Universe theories??

YouTube‚Äôs drunk again!!
Matpat gets terrorized by Mickey Mouse part 4
Makes sense. If so, Disney brass doesn't understand story telling. They should go into a different field. What a waste.
Crap, this actually seems plausible. I basically speedran...spedrun...uh, I powered through this game over the course of a couple of days at a friend's house because I don't own a PS4, so I didn't really take any time to consider the out-of-place decisions like this (except for them completely recreating Let it Go for no reason. I definitely noticed that nonsense =/). But having this retrospective moment to consider the level really makes it seem like something was off about it.
"One of the best keyblades" 
I didn't knew that Happy Gear and Favorite Deputy were locked behind this minigame.
Elsa couldn't be an antagonist fine. Then she by events creates a snow creature that got infused with a Heartless enemy becoming the Snow Queen. This goes around causing all sorts of mayhem and Elsa could team up to stop it.
Sorry but, can you do a theory on who is, "canonically", the strongest fighter in Super Smash Bros?

My bet is on Kirby. He's a destroyer of worlds.
That would have been a MUCH better level style :////
I'd have to say this is true. I heard the next arc of the series will focus on darker themes and more Square titles.
You're not wrong about the egg cracking.  I'll give you that
Never played the games, probably never will, but interesting stuff regardless
GT felt kinda stale lately, but I really enjoyed this theory
Probably one of your most logical theories yet.
3:09; MSPA Reader: Have mental breakdown
People dont forget theories can be debunked so don't say "it's just a theory"
15:58
This room might could represent where Elsa played with Anna at the beginning of the film but then hurt her?
i knew it! i knew it! i knew he would say elsa! 11:14
Only a kid couldve made that dumb meme at 18:44 . Anybody whole played the OG KH2 is out of school, that screen shot is too HD for anybody back when that game was released AND i expected KH players to at least get a D....DD
I can't imagine why Elsa would feel conflicted about her powers, or Organization 13 wanting to recruit her as a member.  She did kinda unleash an eternal winter upon the kingdom, while attempting to flee for everyone else's safety.  Long story, but basically Elsa had just been coronated as Queen, and was being coerced into marriage by none other than...

...Hans.

"Frozen" was based on the Hans Christen Andersen fairy tale, "The Snow Queen", published in 1845 for my fellow die-hard bookworms!
Disney meant for Elsa to be evil in early development. Her concept art is of evil Elsa the snow queen
Wow finally a Kingdom Hearts theory!
It actually makes a lot of sense when explained that way and really would make the world make a lot more sense. It did feel very thrown together and odd honestly and I didn‚Äôt love it as much as I hoped it would honestly. I would love a dlc where they show what they really wanted the world to be and was back before they had to change it honestly.
MatPat: uploads two videos with ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù in the title at once on two separate channels
Theorists: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!
Taking this as canon and why he rushed the ending and the secret ending seems to show two edgy none Disney worlds 

Tired of Disney‚Äôs meddling lmaoo
Mickey's voice in this video is better than the one in KH3
Let's see:

1. A queen with ice powers with no combat experience whatsoever.
2. A giant awesome-looking ice monster who is not only a boss, but is able to transform with icicle spikes and claw attacks.

How is Marshmallow a disappointing party member? I'll take him any day over Elsa.
matpat's channels are one of the only reason I haven't killed myself.

here I feel i belong. around here,  I am normal. back home I over think things way to much
Too late Matpat, i wanna know how Sora was Xehanort the whole time. The only theory you thought of that wasn't decided purely on trends and algorithms needs to be made. Just like the good old days.
"Disney never wanted you to play"     next time: in dlc
Do a mimikyu revealed vid and yandere plz btw ur vids are awesome
Petscop ep 16 is out
eh, the egg cracking was easy for me, it was those dang PEPPER SHAKERS that I couldn't do well at all.
So Disney became the overprotective parent and screwed everything up. Great. Another thing to latch on to "Reasons KH3(2.9) was Disappointing." So when's "KH3.5(3.1): We Fixed it"?
I knew i wasn't the only one who saw this
PETSCOP PETSCOP PETSCOP PLS PLS PLS
Nice shot Matthew
I feel like Mickey mouse in MattPats videos is his equivalent of antisepticeye darkiplier and blankgameplays haha
Now I'm sad I'll never get to experience this story. I really like Elsa but she's always been the villain of the story for me.
As interesting as the story of saving Elsa from herself would be on a conceptual level, we're missing something here:  NO ONE WANTS TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO FIGHT ELSA, at least not seriously!  I wanted to see Sora give her the hug she desperately needs, not have to try and cut her!  A quick fight like with Beast in KH2, where it's clear he's not in control, is one thing, but you're talking about Elsa actively trying to kill you!
We're going to be doing that with Aqua in a few levels, that's hard enough!
Wheres Kirby Dream Land¬¥s Bggest THREAT part 2 and Mass Effect Indoctrination Theory Part 2?
Notification Squad! Hey Matpat! Hey Theorists! <3
10:36 Not gonna lie, I got shivers when I heard their names in that order
MatPat I would LOVE if you summarized and did theories on Kingdom Hearts over the course of several episodes! DO IT!!!!
You could say Disney should've...

Let it go
If this is what happened they should have left it. It would make for great story and game play plus it would line up with the movie. That and it would make her look like a greater princess.
I want to see a death battle of matpat and mickey mouse
Not only is this a real game theory, This is the best episodes you've had in ALONG time
DOKI DOKI LITERATURE HAS BEEN UPDATED!!!! and its kinda weird so please make theory about it...üòÅüòÅüòÅ and maybe you've know tht Libitina is not Yuri (i'm not 100% sure) thts why i need you....üòÖüòÖ
More fnaf images were leaked just to say
YES DISNEY'S PERSECUTION OF YOUTUBERS LIKE BOWLSTREK ISN'T GOING UNNOTICED
I'm gonna overwrite my memory of the Frozen level with the story in this theory. It'd be nice if we got a KH3 DX with the proper level.
What? Nothing sora learned or accomplished had anything to do with the disney worlds
If Elsa becomes a heartless, wouldn't there also be a Nobody... Let's think names Saxel? Lexas? Xelas?
KH3 was just a huge dissapointment
This reminds me of resident evil 6
Larxine? Isn't she dead during the events of KH2? I remember the bestiary of that game has a lot of entries of Organization XIII saying "he/she died during [event I don't remember]" which was pretty much true for like 9 out of the 13.
2:35 - 2:46 leaves me quite unsatisfied....i mean after all the theory states, that this is just rearranged and cut. Where is the promised SECRET LEVEL DOWN IN THE CODE? maybe next time use different words MatPat
It all makes sense, except surely Disney would've vetoed the Elsa = Bad Guy angle pretty early on if they were going to do it at all
"...one, in particular, has got a bunch of flags from both fans and critics. Arendelle"


Ok, this moment I realized that I have played too much Dark Souls III...
Though I must admit, Sora, Goofy, and Donald versus Sister Friede and Father Ariandel fight would be awesome
this might also be the reason frozen was a disappointment for me
It does make a lot of sense, especially when you look in the journal entry for the Wolf boss and realize its name is Sk√∂ll, one of the wolves of Ragnarok that chases the sun. Ending the world by killing the sun is pretty damn analogous to what Elsa's powers would do to the world if left uncontrolled. 

It just so happens that Sk√∂ll is also literally named "treachery" and still tangentially relates to Hans... just not as well.
Mickey is a mad tyrant
I think if Frozen 2 wasn‚Äôt coming this wouldn‚Äôt of been an issue.
If Disney decided to axe this plot idea from Kingdom Hearts, why did they let a darker version of Elsa exist in Once Upon A Time?
The frozen level could‚Äôve been great if they had gust let Elsa be the villain. That sounds so much cooler then what we got instead
Do a theory on LOKI and his fall in Thor Ragnarock
Im just looking for the part where he says "BUT HEY! That's just a theory, A GAME THEORY!"

...

Found it.
Just saying....Square DID give an alternate story as DLC for FFXV. Square? Alternate story battle as DLC for KH3? I'm here for it. Matpat, my mind, once again, has been blown!üôáüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Can you pls do something about March madness like calculating the odds of getting a perfect bracket and then looking at all the different combinations
Hey, MatPat when are you going to do a Star Wars The Old Republic Video?
Can u make a video on roblox?
MatPat, can you just please release pt. 2 of the fnaf timeline?
Maybe they'll add the complete stage to an updated version.They tend to do that y'know.
yeah fnaf is back and it on the steam conversation (and the movie is still coming)
That would have been such a beautiful story.
Great theory mate
I'm gonna tell you straight up. Your gonna get on Disney's bad dide.
The ice wolf is cool
i love the starting of all of these theories
Hi matpat!!!
Definitely not buy these games unless they change up the formal for 3 , it‚Äôs just a mess and the combat isn‚Äôt fun enough in this game to keep me around . It‚Äôs just way to easy . Disney really screwed this game with there corporate greed
Took way to long for a KH theory. Thank goodness!
Honestly, MatPat, it would be interesting if you tried to cover the lore of kingdom hearts. I assume it isn't as long as the history of "Adventure time" and you could finally let it go .
You mean used Elsawhere?
Kingdom Hearts makes Metal Gear Solid lore look logical.
Im starting to think that mickey is evil
I'm never one to like MatPat's theory video in a long time but this was really good and I give him props.
"the snowstorm can't get us here" Donald duck 1934-2019
Mat pat 
do not do to Kirby the same you did with you doctor who theories
Can you do a video on Skyrim about the headless horsemen??? Please!!!
i just got clickbaited by matpat
Fun fact: If you glitch as close as possible to the Ice Palace you can see it has a map layout similar to the top of the ice labyrinth. Coincidence? Of course it is lol!
There should be matpat cinitheric universe with Mickey and matpat
Watching this theory and hearing the line "i dont know, but we better do something" sora say before the boss battle got my like whait whaat?. Pd. Crack that egg over and over and over and over and over and ov.....
is it bad that i could imagine the full concept of the frozen levebeing paid dlc for a quick cash grab
Pleaseeeee. Look into the Lore of Don't starve Together?
i feel the battle between elsa and the team should had have a specific keyblade to use so you fight off the darkness instead of hurting her
According to Roy Conli on Twitter the reason the level came out like it did was because, since Square enix was working closely with the production teams with all the newer movies this time, out of all the movies they picked the Frozen team were the ones that were super overprotective of their movie and forced Nomura and this team to not let Elsa fight and basically made them keep Sora and co out of the plot. So when you see Sora and co fall of the mountain just think of the team that made Frozen shoving them off.

Proof: 
I won‚Äôt eat these mushrooms! Oh but you will matpat
in short, Disney ruins everything
Once again, Disney F***s us.
Has mickey gone insane?
Mickey got worse since I last saw him
On a completely unrelated note... I'll never get tired of this opening. To this day, this is one of, if not THE best intro songs on youtube. Well done, Nirre. Just brilliant.
Hey does a pretty solid Mickey Mouse impression
Snow golem/marshmallow is my favourite character
I 100% thought this when I played the game and think this is not just a theory but FACT.

Especially because they also repurposed elements of this plot for the Toy Story situation with Buzz.
I got the Remy keyblade. Can confirm is best one.
I actually kind of disagree with the assessment at the end. I feel that Disney sometimes sacrifices individual stories in service of their brand as a whole, and in so doing they create an experience rather than a collection of IPs. I mean, Disneyland/world are completely different experiences from anything I've ever seen in my life. It's so much more than just a place where you get to see and experience more of the stories you love, it's like stepping into a different world. It's such a unique experience that I use it as a reference for feelings of wonder when I don't have the words to describe them. While it may not be clear how/if this particular decision had any impact on that,  and while it's certainly true that many brands (including Disney sometimes) overstep to their detriment, I admire Disney's ability to craft something magical in a way that I feel no one else has.
Tetsuya did the same as Scott did
The box!
this reaffirms my belief that kingdom hearts without disney would be a hundred times better. disney is over-protective of their kiddie bait garbage and the disney parts are generally uninteresting (of course with some exceptions).
Omg the intro!
Please please please 
Do one on Freelancer
PS you'll read this on every single one of your videos
no..          no!!   NO!!!!
I really like your YouTube channel,can you do a video about how much Is pac-man eating on all of his games and levels?
Your theory is so much better than the game
i have never heard of this game but i already hate it
Aqua was right, it's all King Mickey's fault.
Not bad for a first theory on the series, you even got all of the lore right! Yeah, it definitely seems like there were better plans initially for the Frozen world. I still enjoyed what we got, but it could have been better. Really is a shame, especially seeing how the Toy Story world was made better thanks to Pixar's involvement. What I really enjoyed from this video was how you realized that the Disney worlds did have a point to them, thank you very much for pointing that out. Also, the 2.9 thing seemed more like an inside joke. This game was fairly self-aware, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. Something more-so to laugh at than face palm at. Definitely looking forward to and hoping for more videos on the series if the quality of this video is anything to go by.
It is the same reason No Disney character is allowed to get norted
Not only this, it would have been really cool to have a Buzz Lightyear boss fight
beginning to think mat has some issues with mickey...
I'm already sad because Frozen world was by far the weakest
Imagine if the Frozen Tower was used Elsa-where.
I love the character design at 16:15. Truly something wonderful.
MY GOSH IM GONNA THROW AN EGG AT MICKEY INE DAY
i've got a idea for a theory if you have seen captain marvel .I think the cat is the monster from the begging of guardians of the galaxy 2 . also bog fan shout out plz
In the case of Elsa falling to darkness (I know this is definitely wishful thinking), the music track that I feel would fit that boss battle best would be Battle of the Heroes from Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith when Anakin and Obi-Wan's duel on Mustafar took place.
An actually good theory, and not one I see anyone in the comments poking big (or even small) holes in. Well done, MatPat. Still not going to re-sub, but I'm glad YouTube recommended this video and that I gave it a chance. Perhaps there is hope yet.
What was that intro tho üòÇ
Now that is something i'd like to play.
Screw you game theory!!
Do splatoon 2 pls
I like the intro XD!
I love the intro, very comedy
The first part of the video is funny
The person you have doing Mickey's voice should have been the one the game hired to do Mickey and not the guy they hired.
i still have to play through the dam level and now i know im going to dread it even more....
its a crappy movie to me in the first place, now its a crappier level to play lol.. hear hear, join the rant of 12 years olds screaming at me due to my opinion on a movie i dont like! XD
It especially works when you consider the story from the book that Disney took the idea from. Elsa was the villain known simply as "the Ice Queen" .
I feel like if they made Elsa a villain It would have been more entertaining and enjoyable
Hey Matt here is a theory of you Could Turok and ARK be in the same universe ?????????? When you start thinking about the scifi mixed with dinosaurs then you have the fact he comes back to life when he dies aka ARKs CLONES people if you know the story. Down to the shards turok picks up look alot like symbols and look crates you kind in ark you don't have to make a video on it but i would like to know your thoughts.
Don't trust the mouse
the donald and mickey voice were spot on wtf
How is that a better Mickey impression then what's actually in the game?!?!?!
Looks like Sub Zero went to 1000 degree levels
1745 why can't that kind of logic be portrayed by Olaf?
at least we got to find olaf's pieces... and then, while exploring for lucky emblems and chests later, get yanked back into that mingame out of nowhere.. loved that......
Maybe you can do a KH theory of the what is in the black box (once the dlc comes out; it could give us some clues to its contents).  I would be very interested on what you think could be inside.  Or maybe the potential role that Yozura has?
Would you consider doing a similar video for the Tangled world?
Even though it wasn't as .easy as this one, it still had bits and pieces that didn't make sense regarding the villains, Mother Grothel and Marluxia
Me: (sees Disney) No, No, No, No!
        (sees Ufotable) Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!.. YES!
14:57 welp I missed a lucky emblem
How about you can do a video of the Broodal
Ya we all hated the cooking mini game. Just accept it. LiTtLe ChEf
plz....... do theory on little nightmares
it is a horror game
That probably would have been the BEST level in the game if they would have made Elsa. Not like a bunch of little girls are playing Kingdom Hearts anyway.
18:40 Thanks for not saying, "Sometimes it's best to just let it go."
Good job you uploaded two videos related...





To
AAAAHHHH MATPAT I LOVE YOUUU!!! 

Edit: Can we please please pleeeaasseee get some kind of more theory for this series???
Do That Sora is Xehanort please and thank you
Way to ruin your own story by being a bunch of p*ssies, Disney.
0:22, Hey look it's Mickey, Mickey Mao.
Now Fnaf vr!!
ÔΩóÔΩàÔΩÅÔΩî if elsa gives away bits of her soul when she creates life?
10 fights of all time Mat vs Mickey with dumb bad sewer food
Dang this is pretty good. If this was actually true and happened. This would of been one of my favorite worlds in the series.
I‚Äôm wondering if MatPat knows about the new teaser for fnaf 7. RIP MatPat 2019
Kingdom Hearts 3 is not good enough.
Nothing more than that.
Wot happened 2 second 3irby theory m8?
hey, I think there might be a lucky emblem in this video
Square Enix: THEY'RE ON TO US!!! RUN
Do an is minecraft communist? Video x
When i was play kh3 and larxene said what she said to sora i  was really excited because i thought we were going to fight evil elsa.
Then i was dissapointed when it didnt happen.
I really thought it was going to be a really cool world. I truly believe in this theory.
MatPats enemies... 
Scott Cawthon
Mickey Mouse
I love your cut M Patrick
can you do little nightmares, please?
That feel when MatPat's faux-Mickey is better voiced-over than the one in the actual game...
just got through the opening bit. im interested in how disney feels about matpats interpretation of micky
You are right Matpat, really good theory. I was really shocked by this world, not only because of the lack of storyline but because when you return to the ice labyrinth you can see that it is bugged. Part of the map is overlapped, around the part of the first elevator, if you try to return there, there is like a cut frame and you change locations, really strange.
I love kingdom hearts but 3 was kinda a let down disney wise. Carona and Arendale along with pirates of the Caribbean are literally just retellings of the story. Pirates of the Caribbean didnt even feel that long like 20 minutes. Monsters inc, toy story and big hero 6 had original stories with two talking place after the main movie. Just very disappointing considering disney helped with the project.
Why is Sora so dumb now.
hey matpat big fan but i found this game called dark deception it seems like a game you will like.
Mouse is so diabolic, crazy, isane.
Donald is obssesed with ingredients.
Goofy is goofy
Haven't watched the full video yet, but this is a pretty good idea for you to do!
Maybe you should try doing more theories like this in the future: trying to explain theories about gameplay elements/levels/bosses that were either cut or put in or whatever purpose.
Where is the Kirby theory? Well it takes a while so it makes sense why it takes so long.
Game theory should do a colab with "@UCH4BNI0-FOK2dMXoFtViWHw", it would be amazing
This is absolutely possible, and I'm sold
Also, the insignia on the ice wolf's forehead----a crossed-out heart, symbolizing her fear and distress about freezing Anna's heart.
Before I get into the video is it going to be like the damn zoo level conspiracy again
Uggggg I wish it was in the game y'all with me
You're hired to tell stories to devs for new games üòÜ
Dang. If it wasn‚Äôt for Disney‚Äôs meddling, my favorite game of all time would‚Äôve. Still been my favorite game of all time but even better! I don‚Äôt care what you critics say! I love this game!!!
The more disney theories that come out, the more evil matpat micky get oooof
Ok, i believe you
can i just say, I. HATE. THE. VOICES. IN. THIS StUpId  GaMe!!! there i said it.
Hey Mat, I've got a theory suggestion! A while ago, I stumbled upon this free game on Steam called Close Your Eyes. I know you've done a theory on another game with this title, but this game is a rpg maker made by Yai Gameworks. I've played the old version and realized that since the second game is coming out later this year, I'd really like to understand what's happened in this game. I'm not the best theorist in the world, but I do feel like the game is telling the story of an assassin on death row who escaped being hung and is trying to go home to his sister that he's made some sort of promise to. If you don't want to do a theory on this, it would definitely be a good play on GTLive or just for your free time. Thanks for taking the time to read!!!! Keep theorizing!!!
Okay so as he said
" who was originally intended to be arendelle's villain"
I Litterally said Elsa as he said Elsa
yay! KH3 theory!
I hate that this makes sense
What a soulless cut made just for money.
Mickey mouse is a soul collector
I know this is stupid af, but please do a theory on the full plot of Dead Cells
Matt Pat, What happen to your "The Division Game Theory" Video? Where you talk about the protagonist Agent killing people for no reason other then you can. Killing the FlameThrower as they try to cleanse the plague, The gangs and police officers who try to hold up the Law. Since you are a Agent of the government and  fight your way thru the Aftermath of the virus. I can understand if you lost videos do your partnership with your former company you were partnered with.
Thanks MatPat really for making a proper Kingdom Hearts Theory. 

Edit: One of the better episodes overall actually, great job!!!
Ah, KH3. I love it. L o v e d  it. But my GOD some of those minigames were dumb.
The Mikie impression is fantastic.
And why is he evil?!?!
I just realized if you take two random things and putting them together you get an rpg
just take 2 words a put that together give me some ideas
I LOVE the lore behind this game. Though I only ever played the first one, I've watched my brother play through all of them. At first it was confusing, but after paying closer attention to them it is absolutely awesome.
There making a vr version of kingdom hearts
Dear matpat,
   Remember Disney's tommorowland quote "feed the right wolf". Your welcome.
In your doki doki literature club stream how the flip did the game replicate stepths voice
Make a vid on song 11 in Minecraft
Please do a theory on little nightmares
Can you do a max and ruby theory please?
I enjoyed the cooking mini-game...
you should do a theory on "do you copy" you would like it!
My largest dislike of the game is the cooking but also the lack of replay ability of the worlds. I honestly thought Maleficent would find not find the boxes but at least stir up trouble looking for the up trouble looking for the boxes. The Olympus, Pete found Pandoras. The land of Corona has the Snuggly Duckling in the background with the one musical song I wanted to hear with all my heart. The Pirates of the Caribbean level the Lord Cutler Beckett could make a comeback. The Monster's Inc. world just seemed so short as well. I feel the game was rushed and did not have the same difficulty as the past Kingdom Hearts, and I miss the rage inducing fight with Sephiroth. I had so much hope being a die hard fan. :'(
Have you read star wars lost star I think the main characters are reys parents
Let's also not forgot that in the original Snow Queen book, the Snow Queen herself is the villain and if I recall correctly, represented the embodiment of winter. 
 I wonder if the frozen sequel will feature the autumn thief or the spring princess?
That would have been SO much way better.
What is Cappy
MatPat your theory is all good and entertaining and all but there is one fact that completely breaks your theory and that is the fact that Elsa inherited one of the pure seven lights. and the seven pure lights cannot create Heartless.
Lol
Assuming this theory is true (and I think it's very likely):  So Elsa turning evil and then overcoming that darkness, either on her own or with friends, isn't a story they (presumably Disney) want a role model character going through?  So if anyone who looks up to Elsa does anything more "evil" than push people away and runaway and be a victim, they just are a person unworthy of redemption?  Great message, Disney.


The only thing I like about Frozen is the soundtrack and Sven the Reindeer, but even I can see the impact its characters, especially Elsa, has had on young people (mostly girls) and marginalized people and I think adding to her character arc even more would be a great thing for them.
"I'm a big fan of these games!"


"Zeeanort"
MatPat, this is a great ( if not a bit soulcrushing) theory! And honestly, you tackled Dark Souls and came up with a great theory  - you absolutely could cover Kingdom Hearts if you wanted to
Game theory 
Wooho
Made to rune our childhood dreams
Game theory 
Wooho
One horned to to kill vido game dreams
Game theory
ring ring oh just the notification bell... wait what matpat made another theory all ready? Insane
Holy crap Sora looks like one of those Roblox Action Figure toys when we see him in the Toy Story universe.
Everyone who's mad about this level needs to watch this video. Nomura tried
Œß is pronounced like 'he' not 'key'
It's conflicting to say it would be better if square cuts disney in order to give themselves some creative control, but disney really brings KH's ethos out more. I love this theory and honestly thought they were gonna go this route the whole time during development, but with elsa being a children's icon really stops the bar.

Plus, the more you know: disney basically had square choke on frozen until they put it in while betting its success all those years ago..that stunned me i'll admit
That Mickey Mouse intro was absolutely hilarious
Dang. I really wish they would have done this instead. Thanks a LOT DISNEY.
Bad Disney for ruining the game >:(
just saying Matpat  there is a theory sora is xhenorts son
Lol the best keyblade in the game is definitely not locked behind the cooking game its the 1 you get in tangled
Matpat, the one who was made to rune our childhood dreams
Hey mattpatt ( sorry if I spelled that wrong) I might have another piece of evidence that might help you out with the deltarune and undertale are connected there's actually someone in the game on the switch that tells you about deltarune but it's not the person you'd expect it would be. If you play undertale on the switch in waterfall when you meet the turtle who tells you about the temmie village if talk theres something that says " the symbol " and he will talk about deltarune. I don't really remember what he said but I hope this help you with your theory.
where's the new fnaf theory for Help Wanted?
I would say the GDs ( game developers) could be sneaky and just release a DLC ( if there could be a DLC) where all this stuff actually happened. Then again, there are legal reasons that I am sure would stop them. But still, if that could happen then it would make people happy and maybe have more people wanting the game ( Smash Bros, Batman, etc,. make good examples of just buying the game for extra content). I myself, have bought games just because the DLC added more content and story to explain what happened or how something happened for random lines, or characters, layouts, and quest. 

P to S: I will say I know nothing about marketing and this is just my opinion. XD
It‚Äôs intros like this that make me worry for your mental health
‚ÄúA story that we can all enjoy no backstory‚Äù then goes to explain the main backstory
Moana=Coco > Frozen
Wow...

Now im waiting for input on scotts new teaser...

I feel like it will be slightly agressive, thinking we were all done.

But ya know, thats just a theory, a game theory theory!
Yea, wow... that was a major mistake.
Nice analysis.
Matpat u are super and i love u and complements....hey who is the man behind u omg thats mickey RUN
Wow this one is REALLY CONVINCING.
Blizzard = dark magic in final fantasy, therefore else uses darkness
I'd like to think it would add some actually and obvious depth to the character, even with the released version of the movie. But BRAND POWER!!!!
do a treyarch zombies theory plz
It may be the worst World but it has the best Keyblade in Kingdom Hearts 3 (in my opinion)
I remember as soon as I got to the Arendelle level I thought "They better not play Let It Go" and of course they did and I was so annoyed. But the marketing team at Disney forcing it on them does make a lot of sense.
Wait Frozen has only one movie, so how can it be a franchise?
Also Erza might have turned into a wolf because her isolation makes her a lone wolf that's a cold hearted predator
do more fortnite on season 8
This theory would make sense if heartless didnt appear of ppl dying, cuz then it wouldnt be so much about sora saving elsa, since shed be already dead, ALTHO, the wolf could have always been a monster created by elsa and they just slapped a heartless symbol onto it to accomodate so hey
I think this actually reflects on why there is ZERO significant Final Fantasy characters in KH3. It makes sense if the teams wouldn't allow modifications to story for the Final Fantasy characters to fill. Not even an optional FF boss T.T
I'm going to save you guys 20 minutes of video: The director is Nomura. He expended all the time and money they had for the game before finishing it. He cut what he didn't have finished and released the game. It's been a pleasure. Disney only fault was wanting to have the same released this century. The same for Square Enix.
Man Why is Micky so crazy
Haven't played enough of the game to hit this level... but this theory makes an extremely good point considering past games have done exactly this.  Try to turn the "Good guy into a bad guy".  Booo on you Disney for meddling.

Totally makes sense even with their shabby Star Wars movies...
This is a seriously good theory, nice job Matpat
All I've asked for, for years, is for KH videos. I'm glad we are now starting to get them. Thanks, Mat
can you do a theory on the Jacksepticeye Egos? and how they relate to the Markiplier Egos? maybe?
I have a very strong feeling this has been happening in the films Disney has acquired as well, let alone games.
I personally loved Star Wars: The last Jedi, but the scene where Rose stops Finn from becoming a martyr for the resistance and says ‚Äòwe will win by saving the things we love‚Äô sounds like the most clunky, ‚Äòjust-added-in-at-the-last-minute-by-Disney-because-they-needed-kids-to-have-a-take-away‚Äô piece of dialogue that has happened in a OG-outside-of-Disney franchise.
I don‚Äôt like that this happens, because it often takes away from the story, but i guess there‚Äôs not much you can do in the world of ‚ÄòDisney owns everything‚Äô.
Wait wait wait! Hold the phone! Elsa is a role model?! She spends most of the movie hiding and running away from her problems, that‚Äôs like saying Aladdin is a role model because he steals things and lies to people, not because he told the truth in the end and potentially gave up everything he worked for to help his friend. Does Elsa have a redeeming quality like that? Well she unfreezes everything, reconnects with her sister and... that‚Äôs about it, what lesson is that teaching little girls? That you can do whatever you want as long as you fix the mistakes you made afterwards? If you ask me Sven is more of a role model than Elsa, because at least he was a good friend and resisted the urge to eat Olaf‚Äôs nose
It would be amazing if someone with enough skill could rip this level out and re-purpose it into the level that you described.  But hey, that's just a theoretical hope. :D
Do HeartBound already. We have been stuck for more then 2 months on a flipping toaster. You owe it to us after you did that click bait thing.
Mat pat,when you will continue with five nights at freddys theory?At the latest video you said „Ääin the next video„ÄãBTW great video!!üòâ
"Its just a Theory A Game Theory"
i love this game too
hahaha
This would've made Arendelle SO much better. But god as it is now, it's the second worst level outside the Caribbean.
This is officially my head cannon
Yah this makes to much sense...But hey at least the you only climbed the mountain....3 times could have been 4
I'm unsubbing from this channel.
100% the fault of Matpat.  He refuses to admit his plagarism, attacks anyone who holds him to account on it with facts and is generally quite an arrogant person.  It's quite the smahe that he is like this because a long time ago I subbed to the channed because he was the polar opposite of this.  This was still a small channel then and Matpat was honest and did the right thing.  Not anymore sadly.

It seems matpat has let fame get to his head in all the wrong ways.
I doubt matpat or any of his very large team will even care about this.  Sad but true.  At least I will have one less arrogant youtube channel host on my subscription list.
For the approx 11m people who condone Matpat's actions I say, your loss.  Ignorance is bliss for you all.  You're all free to be happy in your ignorance.

I liked the old MatPat run game theory channel that was run properly.  What this chanel has become yeah such a disgrace.  If Matpat ever decides to fix up his act and start acting like a respectable youtube channel host again, I'll re-sub, but if not, so be it.  No skin of my nose.  There are many respectable youtube channel hosts much more worthy of our time.
Urgh, now I feel even more disappointed with Disney
i feel like they got tired of developing and trying and just slapped whatever they had together and shipped that out
You are bad guy 
But you are not a bad guy
I honestly have never agreed more with a theory then right now. Everything you have described parrells so well I bet 100% that is what actually happened which as you said is ironic. If they had just left it as is it wouldn't have been such a problem cause honestly when you think about it, it would set up the sequel pretty well to based on the teaser but no! Disney just had to mess it up huh?
this makes me wanna say the n word
Finish your kurdi theory
Do a fnaf theory
This made me want to watch Disney death count
Please don‚Äôt hate me too much....I‚Äôm not a fan of frozen at all, but I was anticipating it as one of the BEST worlds to explore in the entire series. I was severely disappointed. MatPat this was a very well thought out theory. I feel like it could actually be fact. Elsa being the villain made so much sense in the game (and movie). If she were to ever be ‚Äúbad‚Äù in the first place it‚Äôs due to the conflict in her heart. She can be redeemed. Disney has a habit of making a lot of villains 1 dimensional: The only goal is to succeed in their dastardly plans. They could‚Äôve brought a new character formula into the franchise ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
can you do a  theory on the blackout clubs.
Day 2 of asking matpat to do an animal crossing theory

I should really do more work on thinking of what the theory could be. Ok I got it. 
Why are all the villagers animals but you are human? It‚Äôs a thing that the animal crossing fans have just written off for far too long. But there have been multiple animal crossing theories about this topic. One theory being that the animals in your village have kidnapped you. People think this because at the start of animal crossing wild world and city folk kapp‚Äôn drives you to your destination. Kapp‚Äôn is a kappa. Kappas are Japanese folk creatures who steal children away. But kapp‚Äôn only drives you to your town in two of the 4 (almost 5) games. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs totally off the table but, I think it is less likely that they are kidnapping you. My theory is that you are DEAD and are in purgatory waiting to go into either heaven or hell. Think about it. You start the game just appearing on either a train, taxi or bus with no backstory at all except your ‚Äúmom and dad‚Äù send you letters on holidays. I think you got hit by a train/taxi/bus and died on impact. It was the last thing you ever saw before your death so you go there. When you arrive at your town you are greeted by a bunch of animals. I‚Äôve heard before that in purgatory you get soothed with things you loved. (Idk if this is true or not, I don‚Äôt have time to research. And also this is just a concept.) Maybe you loved animals and now you see them all the time. Now for the real hitter... the gyroids. Gyroids are figures in Japanese culture that get buried with the dead after a loved one or friend passes away. You find them all over your town after rainy days. And there is also an Easter egg that if you reset your game enough (I think) then your face turns into a gyroid. There is also a villagers face that is a gyroid. Now we can tell that the devs knew what they were about to do to the animal crossing fan base. I would type more but I‚Äôm tired right now.

And yes I know this episode was a kingdom hearts theory not anything else.
Man, I would've loved that level way so much. It would've made so much sense in the kingdom hearts verse. 
Plus...wouldn't have to climb that mountain so many damn times!!!
I stayed up 2 actual days, so I could beat the Kingdom Hearts 2 little mermaid musical mini game, I was going for 100% in "Under the Sea"
And I did it
congratulations to Matthew, for speaking on the Google unveiling of Stabia.
I was over the roof when I heard his name in the unveiling, and then he came in and gave a great speech that shows how creator would be able to include challenges and get more involved in their community.
Well done MatPat.
Can I just say Han is a Cold Alpha Wolf?
May you check SCP Containment breach?
You keep saying Multiverse it's a single universe stick to your own theories dummy
There is a video called Speed of Kirb you need to watch it and maybe do a theory on it
Hey mat remember how you how you said that you were done with fnaf. Well I have a question for you. WHERE DOES FNAF TAKE PLACE? I mean like what state and city
I came here from NicoBs channel
...
So in short, we should hate Disney more than Square for KH3 being a flop
Hey MatPat~~~Guess what? The new FNAF game is coming......SO YOU BETTER MAKE ANOTHER THEORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally! A Kingdom Hearts theory!
a look a lucky emblem!

darkness within darkness!

x-blade!
One day his kid is going to look back on these...
2:00 Don't worry. Just make a theory about the MULTIPLE Afterlifes in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
This actually makes a lot of sense. Great theory!
I see MatPat and Kingdom Hearts...I CLICK!!!
Please don‚Äôt sample Larxene.
Nobody wants that.
Fascinating. This place, is so, rather, entertaining. However, can it, well, truly be said that secrets can be so complex? Though, I have one question. What if, let us inquire, that you had to solve a theory that lasted longer than your own life? That, theorist, would, let us go as far as say, be VERY, VERY, INTERESTING. However, not all is so, complex or integrate, is it? Though, we all should learn something. You mentioned that the game had reused previous content? You could say, that... It is the only thing that is left to make. The only difference is, well, you know that answer. After all, game mechanics can not be striked, nor protected. What's left of this world? Ours may exist indefinitely, but how many times will it repeat, change, corrupt, improve? Are we cut from black and white? Will we exist in color, and vibrancy? How many times will we go through that sequence, before we finally find a refined project? Though, you must not understand what I go on about. Maybe, we were never meant to exist in the first place. So, why am I here? It is much more simplistic than it seems. I'm actually not here at all while the same time I exist. Though, you don't want to hear me lecture you about such insignificant things. No. You want theories. Unfortunately, I can offer no such thing, at the moment. What I can offer, is this. A simple, unknown, video. Sorry to bother you in such a way, but, I rather find that I can't resist them. After all, a piece of a puzzle can not change what it portrays, however, everything is not so fixed in place. There is still some freedom to move about, and adapt, while changing all the same. Anyway, here is that music I promised. 
When i see you on the stadia conference i say NANI
OMG yes this is the best intro matpat has done by far
I totally thought I was going to have to fight Elsa! Was a bit disappointed it didn't go that way,  it seemed like it was with the beginning of the storyline. This theory makes SO much sense!
It‚Äôs been six years SIX YEARS since you said you would make a call of duty nazi Zombies (treyarch)
Help your looking game store
Cough cough fnaf's back COUGH COUGH
That's it! HEY BENDY! CAN YOU HELP MATPAT!? HE IS GETTING KILLED BY THE MOUSE!
When you think about it kingdom hearts is basically people people sensless with a metal baseball bat
NEW FNAF TEASER GET ON IT WE NEED UR HELP
man... the mouse is insane...

why is Mickey Mouse for a bad guy
Was that anime elsa

SILENCE, BRAND

Honestly tho, as much as this is true of all of GT videos, this theory really holds water. Nice work.
Donald is so unintelligible it hurts
Hey matpat by the way I want you to do Dark Descent and there's a new birdie around called dread Becky and I want you to look at the teasers and all the videos for you actually do your video on the facts about the two wolves and a 3-minute and in a a video and I want you to actually go on Dark Descent not the major thing for most likely that a major thing but I want you to actually just go to their there's a channel that actually is the company that made the Dark Descent not the admission thing but I just totally got descent by the way it's just that word and by the way just type it into into YouTube and save the chapter 3 cuz I need you to die please okay
People are upset for getting snow ball? But he is amazing and adorable.
God dammit Disney!!!! You completely ruined what could've actually been a good level, compared to the garbage we got üôÑ
Sooo we r just gonna ignore how gud those voice acting was?
Its called 2.9 cause the level is unfinished so it wasn't a troll its literally a UNFINISHED GAME
Bte this is t the final game of Kingdom hearts. There's gonna be another if you watched the credits
(VR Chat) Game Theory: What exactly is "da wey"?
I LOVE THE INTROS THAT CACKLING MICKEY HAD ME SO GOOD
HEY MatPat good luck with the new fnaf VR game that already as teasers
I HAVE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU.  I have loved the KH series for over 12 years and most people don't play all of the games.  I have given up trying to explain the plot.  Can you make a video(s) to explain the plot?  My sister and my friend are trying to understand but as you know, Nomura has made that impossible even for loyal players.  Please?

Also, I love your videos.
#StopACTA2
Thank you I wanted to see someone look in the code and see if there's hidden stuff, thanks guys.
Well whatever the case may be, at least there's something good we got out of this Frozen level. Now we have an explanation why Hans randomly turns evil for no reason. He was just infected by the darkness the whole time.
Who‚Äôs ready to make hacks for getting in the damn castle
Saaaaay. How about that mini game.
Hahahahahaha + Hahahahahaha
Hans was a wolf in sheeps clothing...
18:26 that look like a lucky emblem
This theory makes a lot of sense. That level was one of the worst parts of the game, but if it had the story you're talking about, it could have been a great level. Also, that part at the beginning with Mickey was so creepy, but hilarious. I hope it doesn't give me nightmares since I am watching this before bed.
Honestly, if the brand team for Frozen wanted to prevent people from not wanting to see Frozen 2 they didn't do a good job. They made a great movie into the worst world in the Kingdom Hearts series which is saying something. It's definitely enough that, unless they pull some magic out of where the sun don't shine, I won't be seeing it since I've completely lost faith in the brand team. Hats off to Square Enix for putting together something actually playable for the finished game though. I have some idea how hard that must have been and honestly I'm surprised that Frozen was even in the game.
so Elsa can give life, but can she GIVE GIFTS?
Frozen 2 Elsa will turn evil confirmed?
NOT THE EGGS!  NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Where you at #notificationsquad? Join me.
Me: watches theory on kingdom hearts III
YouTube: plays add for kingdom hearts III

Legit made me laugh XD.  But in all honesty I didn't mind the frozen level.  Then again I was more focused on finding those DAMN EMBLEMS!!!
A have a question Matpat can you do a video on the Mario Galaxy 2 shadow people and what they are?
Honestly been enjoying these videos so much lol Keep up the good work MatPat!
Can you pleeeeeeease do dead by daylight I would love that thank you for taking time to read this suggestion üòã
Srry mate but another fnaf game therory nite be coming
#bewarethemouseü§©‚úåÔ∏è
I have a great Game Theory! So it‚Äôs about the game Rocket league and I was wondering if you could make a game theory about how it could be possible to make a supersonic acrobatic battle cars!!!!
Maybe dlc content
Mickey mouse should go to jail for assault
I'm not going to lie, my first playthrough I thought the ice wolf WAS Elsa's darkness, I didn't realize it was supposed to be Hans until I read it online later.
That version of the story would‚Äôve been a lot better
I want Larxene to step on me
Do another fnaf theory because there still some lose ends for me
Considering Scott has a new teaser
Do another mortal kombat theory pleas
To game and movie
No wonder why he came in, there was no keep out sign on his side of the door.
Hey game theory there is a new fnaf game
Godammit...the voice acting for the squeenix characters is just so......Anime....and not even the good kind, but the cringey kind.
I finished going through surgery, 


Like=prayer
Comment=pain killers
You know what! we don't need Disney to make a cool arendelle story! we can make a KH3 fanfiction based on the true story this Theory presented today!
I agree with your theroy and they could still have Anna Save else scene who wants to go reconnect with her sister.

Thank you. I hope the DLC will fix the game and fix the frozen level
Im super sorry to tell you this but a new fnaf teaser just got released like a week ago and its in vr.....................*my impersonation of you* üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Hey, Mat, you should be a game developer, or maybe help give game developers ideas on how to tell a convincing story, because your version of Arendelle has a lot more depth and heart than the official version.
Flawless theory, this is literally the reassurance that every kh3 player could use for this pit stain of a level
Wait, Ratatouille is in KH3? Oh, now I HAVE to play it!
Damn... this makes way more sense than I thought it would. As soon as you started to lay it out, I realized why the whole ice labyrinth existed, and it all kind of clicked together. This would‚Äôve been an epic level, possibly the best in game, had it been realized.
Day one of asking matpat to do an animal crossing theory
But the frozen Keyblade weapon modes is still pretty awesome!
Yeah for real thanks Disney... sarcasm right there
17:48 I'm I the only one who expected him to say, "give gifts"
10^12431
Dat opening
That was the biggest thing that threw me, too. As an avid fan of the Frozen story, Elsa‚Äôs character in particular, I was confused and a bit annoyed that the struggle between light and darkness in her heart wasn‚Äôt in the spotlight. Especially considering the themes and role light and darkness have in Kingdom Hearts as a series. I still enjoyed the stage as it was, but I‚Äôll admit that I wanted it to be more.
Kingdom Hearts 3 was a disappointment for a lot of people considering how long we had to wait for a 30 hour long game. Arendelle wasnt an exception in this fact given how sloppy and boring the level actually was, and how short the Pirates of the Caribbean level was as well. If Disney let Square Enix do their own thing, the game would be far better as a whole.
dat face Mickey makes lol
I've actually thought about what would happen if MatPat tried to make a theory out of KH. I wondered if he even played or if he just had enough sense not to do it. Not even bc of the convoluted plot but bc Nomura literally just half the time throws stuff in bc he wants to and then later connects it. The answer is obviously the latter but I appreciate this theory but it also makes me sad bc of how much we're missing if it's true. 
If they had plans for it before Frozen had even been released I could totally see it being true considering Disney's much earlier plans for her and no one knowing how popular it would get. If it hadn't been, they probably could have gotten away with a temporarily dark Elsa, but alas, MatPat is right. They can't have their new role model have anymore "problems". :/
I think the reason why Hans became the Ice wolf was supposed to be a representation of how he was the one who had a cold heart instead of elsa. I still think this is a logical theory though with Elsa being the original villian since originally that's how it was supposed to be in the movie as well.
When the game theory notification pops up
Me: OMG YASSSSSSSS
Elsa's a wolf now
Me: Puts down Magnus Chase Book 1
Me: Oh shizz
tl;dr: Square Enix  wanted to make Elsa the villain but Disney was like 'Lolno.' 

This feels like it didn't even need a Game Theory episode honestly.
Great vid! Can you make more Zelda? also more theory wear...
MatPat's version of that level sounds waayy cooler! (pun intended) lol
Matpat find swaggersouls face
That intro was just perfect
This level would had been perfect, but this is what we get. üòë
Mappat if you read this comment could you do a game theory on joy of creation
You damn know the thumbnail does clickbait through another meaning for perverts...
Hey mate, can i get some final fantasy theorys? Maybe you could do one after final fantasy 7 remake comes out. Oh and i heard it was coming out on my birthday, lol.
Ok I really really hope we get a confirmation on this theory and who knows! Maybe they‚Äôll fix it in 3.5 lol
why does donald duck sound like hubert cumberdale flesh boy from salad fingers 11....
Okay I believe you.
In the beginning of the video that Mickey mouse was terrific
I just realized something, Mickey Mouse is your new Mario isn't he Matpat?
Pretty solid theory, but there's one in thing you forgot to mention. That the hole thing with Elsa coming to terms with the good in her has happened before with The Beast in Beast's castle. When organization XII starts tricking Beast into thinking his friends don't  care about him, he starts to except the darkness in his heart. In the manga he starts to become a heartless until Bell snaps him out of it. Since she the main thing he cares about, he always protects her, and subcomes to the darkness in his heart.
at least the final boss of this world was great.
This level dosen't bother me anyway.
Don‚Äôt you just love a 1 minute 30 second intro
James Charles has kissed you. (He had lipstick onüíÑ). 

Turn this blue to undoüòÅ
üëáüèª
at this point we should just have MatPat vs. Mickey Mouse Death Battle!
Great job on this one matpat and I can really appreciate that you made it largely spoiler-free. People give you a lot of flack these days but you're still just as insightful, informative, and fun as ever. Never stop being you Matthew.
DID YOU SEE THE NEW TEASER IMAGES FOR FNAF???
I know a good theory Chara plus frisk equals Kris
OKAY, I WANT TO MAKE THIS LEVEL AVAILABLE AS A MOD?? JUST TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE
Who here still has nightmares about kingdoms2s boss sephiroth and the little mermaid level and the glorified gumbo ship level of xemas up untill the real boss fight
Hey mat, did u see the new fnaf teasers, (hint hint)
That intro tho
It took u half the vid to get to the point
Mat and Mickey‚Äôs ongoing rivalry is so great.
My bet, all the assets are actually there, and they'll be "unlocked" for a small fee. #DLC
Do a fanboy and chum chum Do a fanboy and chum chum theory
Doki Doki ..... 3130
Why did you not say "let it go" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
-Friendship
-Love

"fall into despair"
Huh...... who else have danganronpa flashbacks?
also keep in mind that elsa was originally the villain because thats how it was in the original story that Frozen is based off of where "the snow queen" was indeed the villain.
Elsa getting corrupted and cured is also a lesson like "everyone goes through dark times but with the help of family and friends can get back up." come on Disney take notes
Used "Elsa"where, I'm sorry, that sucked
Elsa is one of the 7 pure lights.. So she can't have any darkness in her heart. Larxene was just talking about what she'd choose since she didn't know she was a pure light.
I wonder if something similar happened to Tangled. It's also pretty much a scene for scene recreation of the movie. It was much more coherent though.
Nooo, Mickey is my favourite detective! How dare you make him evil??? üòÖüòÇ
Since MatPat doesn't want to explain the kingdom hearts lore imma hope he'll pin this
Search this:
A good enough summary of kingdom hearts
It explains kingdom hearts in a memrable and funny way and really helped me understand the game
(And no, im not one of those comment bot ads i actually really like the vid
Disney now owns 20th Century Fox
Theories?
I have an idea,
What if the creator of kingdom hearts made a Frozen storyline and Disney bought it from them and cut it out of the final game.
Just sayingü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Who needs a secret zoo level when you have an underdeveloped confusing kingdom hearts level?
i don't know why but having mickys laughter in the theme made it sound like a video game was starting up...
If this theory is correct, they should have kept this in the game!
You're right. That could've been a really cool story
i'm still wondering about the slender man theory he  talked about in the first video of fnaf
Using that napoleon total war music üëåüëå
I think Kris And Chara are the same person because Why would day have a green striped shirt
We found the zoo level guys
This makes perfect sense, Frozen was a missed opportunity and was the most rushed part of the game I felt. Nomura is a good storyteller and the themes of Frozen were a match in for the themes present in Kingdom Hearts, all of the other worlds had themes that connected the Disney and kh characters, but not Arendelle. This is a solid theory you've made, probably the best one I've seen and the most likely one to be true at that.
This is really compelling
Idea: What is the life expectancy of a Pokemon, does this change with different pokemon, or if evolution changes this?
15:06 hey! A lucky emblem!
New fnaf game coming out teaser on Scott's website
I liked this, do another theory about an unfinished game, Metal Gear Solid 5! With so much meddling from Konami, we should know could've been from Hideo Kojima's grand vision.
‚ÄòWatches intro‚Äô then 
thinks to myself: and you wonder why Disney hates you, matpat.
Wouldn't the snow golem fight for her tho, in the movies it's her royal guard
A few thoughts...

Kirby as a child: In Dream Land 1, it's established via the manual that he's "a little boy." Sure. I get that. But it doesn't change the fact that he's still a threat to Dream Land. For him to be SO powerful and SO naive is a dangerous combination. Notice in the script I never call him evil. I don't think he has ill-intent. Just because I say he's a villain doesn't mean that he's evil or has bad intentions. I mean it as he's a THREAT. That said, I've changed the title to avoid confusion.

Regarding Dyna Blade: Him helping the children after the scene I showed doesn't change the point -- he beat up someone BEFORE learning the whole story, like I tried to make clear in the script. Seeing that scene, he beats up the mom, THEN sees the kids, gives the screen a "cha-ching" gesture and steals them away, feeds them and teaches them to fly...stuff the MOTHER should be doing but can't because she was injured. I get it: Dyna "forgives" him in Revenge of Meta Knight...the same way Landia does in Return to Dream Land, but I see that more as plot convenience because Kirby is the "good guy," or them realizing they have to fight the "true" evil. But think about Kirby;s ACTIONS...if someone just came up to you and started beating you up for no apparent cause, would YOU forgive the person? See them as a hero? Probably not. And don't forget that EVERYONE he fights along the way is in NO WAY connected to the battle between him and Dyna...they're innocents caught in the middle.

Kirby's Avalanche: In both Epic Yarn and the original Kirby's Dream Land manual (those are the ones I can think of offhand, but there might be more), Kirby actually speaks English...or something that translates to English, so I think comments throwing these lines out as invalid might be premature. Yes, the game is non-canon, which I acknowledge, but the idea that Kirby ONLY speaks "poyo" isn't necessarily true...or it can be assumed that ALL of Avalanche's lines are translated poyo.

And yes, I know Avalanche is a version of puyo puyo...it was a joke. Obviously it's not a Candy Crush mod since, if nothing else, Candy Crush came DECADES later. 

Kirby as a God of Destruction: That's in part 2 :)

I think that's all the major concerns I'm seeing in the comments. Like I said, I don't think he's intentionally villainous. He's a neutral agent of chaos who gets pointed in a direction and just GOES. But when you look at his actions in the games I call out, a lot of times he's doing more harm than good. Does he do good? Absolutely. But he's still a threat.
Mat pat: kirby is an ameoba

Also mat pat: kirby is A gOD OF DESTRUCTION
Mattpatt: Part 2 coming next week!

...meanwhile 2 weeks and 3 new videos later...
"Kirby woke up before he could fully mature as a star warrior"

... He's a baby
matpat: "im proving kirby is evil"
meteorz: "hold my beer this boi friendly"
Video game protagonist: exists
Game Theory: Well, Yes, But actually no
Videogame protagonist: *exists
Game Theory: A C T U A L L Y
EXCUSE ME DO YOU HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR KIRBY
16:20 but that's an episode for next week
(Passes 3 weeks and done two FNAF theories)
There is a reason why Kirby and Boo from dragonball lookalike
Wait... so Kirby is Beerus (Dragon ball super)?
Mario is sociopath, link is dead, Kirby is a good of destruction. Next olimar is an evil dictator.
MatPat... now you should really watch Meteorz' latest video of his Kirby Canon series. After that you should overthink your theory.
0:56 sorry to burst your bubble mat but Kirby can't inhale scarfy therefore your whole theory has been disproven
You've been watching Kirby Canon, haven't you?
But remember, Kirby has a mind of a child, but the power of Dark Matter.
But mat pat Meta Knight just took the chest without telling anyone what was in it
He protec.
He attac.
But most importantly, he want his cake bac.
is it bad I love Kirby even more now?
Complains about Kirby bosses*
This is your best theory probably. Cant believe no one thought about this.
I'm amazed Bill Cipher hasn't been a final boss in Kirby yet. Also why doesn't Kirby just open up a bakery if he just wants to sit around and eat sweets instead of terrorizing Dreamland?
Kirby: u got cakke?
Dedede: yea
Kirby: you shall perish mortal
i don't like this because I like Kirby but god dammit you are very convincing
Mat:He is not a hero he is not a villain
Me: he is chill


Only flamingo viewers will get it 

The meme.only me who watches Albert and mat
1 kirby destroyed meta kight's ship because he thoght it was evil and to without being told to he SAVED popstar
So basically Kirby is easily manipulated and would do anything no matter the consequences or reasons
Congratulations, you've managed to piss off the kindest fandom on the planet.
What ever kirby dose that causes

 destruction HE fixes it. In dream land 

MAGOLOR IS THE VILLAIN not kirby, he

 says the kirby is a hero to cover up

 and make him seem innocent and the

 dragon, he thought that magolor was a

 good person and seeing that the

 dragon shot down the ship, kirby

 thought it was evil. And kirby didn't

 know that the star rod was going to

 release nightmare he thought that he

 was doing a good deed
Strong forces of evil are released:
Kirby Sleeps
Cake goes missing
Kirby: W O K E
mat pat what if kirby just has ad hd a brain thing that DOSENT MAKE YOU THINK SRTAIGH AND NOT PLAN AHEAD OFTEN!!!!! AKA KIRBYS "BEHAVIOR"
But if Kirby didn't help Ribbon in Kirby and the crystal shard what could have happened to Ribbons planet could have bean devastating
At least Kirby does his taxes, unlike that fraud Yoshi...
I wouldn't say a god of destruction as much as an impulsive child with no idea about their limits.
Video game Protagonist: Exists

Matpat: Well yes, but actually no
I knew meta Knight was the real good guy...
In Kirby's Adventure Kirby was just panicking as everybody would do plus HE IS LITERALLY A BABY WHY WOULDN'T HE LOOK CONFUSE IN RETURN TO DREAM LAND?!?! XD
They stole his cake what do you expect he wouldn‚Äôt murder everyone in his way
The people who "made" kirby do that where helping kirby not geting him to do it
So on a related note, my absolute favorite episode of Death Battle is Kirby vs Majin Buu from Dragonball Z. If yall havent seen it I can't recommend it enough, lots of deep diving on the lore (including the Kirby cartoons) to find Kirby's ULTIMATE POWER LEVEL. He doesn't disappoint
So is kirby good?
Matpat:Well yes but actually no
Guys moral of the story
Dont steal kirby's cake
And dont be related to kirby
Kirby is a Kirby.


end of discussion.
‚ÄúWhole separate discussion for next week‚Äù It‚Äôs been two weeks now... L I E S
I wish that you would finish this theory. I personally enjoyed this theory.
Kirby part 2 is the next dr. Who part 3
Me: hey Kirby wanna be friends?
Kirby: nope I'm gonna kill u
Solution to theory = Kirby is baby and doesn't know better
Oh, y-yeah! Thanks Mat! A-as If my childhood wasn‚Äôt ruined because my favorite Nitendo Character was a demon!
Someone: KIRBY WILL KILL US ALLLLLLL!!
Us: you insane
MatPat: KIRBY WILL KILL US ALL! 
Also us: that makes sense
"Floating Jellybean Magolor"
HES A FREAKING EGG
without this video:
"what should i watch?"
----
with this video:
Mario is evil.
Kirby is evil.
What's next?
Link is evil?
I feel like you went too far in this video
Technically mat gourmet race was a competition.
Marx 

Hmm this sounds familiar

Carl... carl marx
MatPat: Kirby is evil, proved! 

Kirby fandom: Hold my star rod
Yeah but Kirby is a literal baby, so he doesn‚Äôt know any better.

Also he could just be too trusting.
The way matpat describes Kirby he sounds kinda like Beerus DRAGONBALLS God of Destruction
Clearly most people enjoyed this judging by the like-dislike ratio. 
I did. 
The comments are weird.
Never liked Kirby








Now I like him less. In fact I hate him now.
You can't get mad at kirby because he is just a god without a powerful knowledge
You did not treat waddle dee with respect. Forgive me child, for what i must waddle doo. Pulls out gun
Kirby: the people were possessed I had to eat them
Matpat: cool motive still murder
3:00 ok so by now i think i already now im gonna see like 10 minutes of a "theory" that can be confirmed or denied through ONE pause screen menu in the final part of void termina
After he beat the hell outta dyna blade, he took care of them as his resposibility when it was his choice. bOoM
Amount Kirby fans will probably understand how people felt about Sans is Ness theory.
Well to be fair, and this is the reason that I avoided asking for a Kirby game theory in he first place, Kirby is just a child.

His actions honestly make sense. Kirby has the traits of a child too. He doesn‚Äôt really know what to do unless someone points him in the right direction. Good (like family would) or bad (like manipulative ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or strangers). That also explains why he has a one track mind. He only cares about what is important to HIM, and not others. Kirby, like a child, was acting based on incentive, like a kid getting good grades only to get the newest video game, not really thinking of his future. But he is still a hero, and he does try to do what‚Äôs right most of the time.

Kirby is definitely good, but he is still learning. He just so happens to have a lot of wild power that most people are able to exploit for their own purposes.
Kirby is supa savage , i go intoo the same rampage if someone messes with my ben&jerry s
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MY NAME IS IN THE DESCRIPTION!!!!!!
(I did captions)
Forced to act
Loves to eat
Only does things for food

Kirby is Beerus
ƒ∞t didn‚Äôt change because he is a toddler. ƒ∞nstead, my looks for king dedede changed
Kirby wasn't trying to defeat Galeem and Darkhon to save the Universe.

He was just destroying the competition.
14:57 ‚Äúdeal with it m9?‚Äù 
Are you sure about that context?
Deal
With
It
‚ÄúM9‚Äù?
What is even yours? And like what are ya trying to say?
This is the comment section.
60% = the theory is wrong
30% = MatPat: well yes but actually no.
29% = other comments
1% = agrees with the theory
I have nothing funny to say.
But can I still have 0.0846 likes?
Edit: Ayy!! I got a like!
Kirby:WHO TOOK MY CAKE!?

All: ...

Kirby:THEN I WILL EAT YOU ALL.

All:*slight panicking*
See, you're saying all this like I'm not gonna be thrilled that Kirby is Chaotic Neutral. That is literally my favorite alignment and since I main Kirby in smash I couldn't be happier with my little pink boi.
Yeah, there is definetely not gonna be a part 2 for this video. Couldn't handle the hate, Matpat? Well, maybe it was for the best. Besides, we have Meteorz instead.
If Kirby was a god of destruction,  then why didn't his universe go to the tournament of power.
Kirby in a nutshell 

Task failed successfully
What a madlad, uploading a video about Kirby on MAR10 day
me: Kirby = üòà.
Kirby: no I'm not ‚òπÔ∏è.
Me: yes you are.
Kirby Return to Dreamland actual story to Bomberman 64
I guess part two was cancelled :/ Good video though dude, i feel you listen to the people that complained and change it when the majority enjoyed the video and wanted more.
Nintendo:kirbys extra epic yarn

Matpat:*FacePalms*
Kirby is literally a child. This seems like, more or less, normal behavior for a kid with godlike abilities.
Thanks matpat made me never look at mario again now kirby :(
Kirby gets hit in the head with an apple
Kirby: Devours the entire multiverse
Kirby is one hell of a Chaotic Neutral. Damn man
Go to What is Kirby Canon? #20 - Kirby.
Remember kirby is a baby. Kirby don't know nothing
Kirby is bapy,
your argument is invalid
So 2018 super smash bro utimate says Kirby is a cute demon
whens part 2 coming!?! please tell us madpat.
Kirby is a god of destruction? Is he stronger than beerus?

Find out in the next episode of dragon ball z
I‚Äôd love to see a Kirby villain that offers him like... a small piece of candy or something in exchange for taking over the universe for them 

That‚Äôs a flawless master plan
10:20 
‚ÄúJust caring about the impulse that strikes him in the...‚Äù
Ad popes up
Me: Clever timing there YouTube
Now I will tell you a story: The two brothers were given names by g@$/3; Sans and Papyrus they were stuck with that name forever Dr.&@$ter wanted to create more artificial souls so he asked some friends in the underground for a sample of there blood. And so doc began to work on the souls he now had more lab assistants Sans and Papyrus were not alone. They all saw the entire underground and they saw what the doctor was really working on the CORE it was the only thing powering the underground with electricity. 








Want part three look up the Mario odyssey is a lie,    part 1 is on the apex Theory
Kirby Lore: Star Allies. That video changed the whole perspective for me
Kirby is basically Majin Buu. I been figured this out
He protecc
He atacc
But most importantly 
u shall not touch his snacc


Edit:holy fucc how did i manage to get that many likes?
Nah Kirby doesnt care cuz...
Its his "DREAM LAND"
This theory also works in World of Light, Kirby fights Galeem and Dharkon not bc they're evil or whatnot, but bc his fighting buddies are gone.....he fought Galeem just so he could fight his "friends"
I always knew to never trust the Kirby but his cuteness was taking over.
Rip Robbie Rotten
Anybody:*drops apple on kirby.Kirby:your free trial to mercy has ended
He‚Äôs not good
He‚Äôs not evil
He‚Äôs hangry
Also he‚Äôs a baby! Meta Knight and Dedede are heroes. But Kirby is a baby and doesn‚Äôt know.
Basically, Kirby is a cute and powerful naive psychopath.
But... Squeak Squad, Kirby had nothing to do with the chest. That was entirely the Squeaks. Yeah, the others were entirely Kirby's fault, but mate, that was was entirely NOT his fault.
I know i hate kirby so much!
...
What are you talking about?
My profile pic is kirby?

Darn it.
You‚Äôre ignoring a very important factor tho, strawberry cake is delicious.
Kirby: Se aprovechan de mi nobleza
A:save cake.
B:save the galaxy
Kirby chooses A
Kirby:payo 
He says that as the universe crumbles
JJHFLHDISOSDIFHEQ9PHUSFSYFIYDSYUFUYYIHRWTYWURFHSGISGSGSFVHDHD Why Yo Do This
I wouldn‚Äôt wanna see Kirby step on a legoüíÄ
Duh he doesn't have brains. We already determined he was a single cell. (Remember the nubblies?)
Chaotic neutral...hm...I'm being Kirby in my next dnd playthrough! :D XD
Kirby is like Majin Buu from Dragon Ball Z. Innocent, destructive creature focused on eating everything.
Kirbys a gumball that escaped from a lab but hey thats a theory a game theory
Kirby

The final boss of God of War 8
This confirms that Game Theorists is funded by King Dedede
Nobody:
Matpat: KIRBY IF A GOD OF DESTRUCTION 

Honestly tho I just think Kirby doesn‚Äôt have morals or a brain
Nobody:
Matpat: KIRBY IF A GOD OF DESTRUCTION 

Honestly tho I just think Kirby doesn‚Äôt have morals or a brain
MatPat: Kirby is a god with the soul purpose of destruction. but that will be a whole other discussion for next week.
Me who has waited 3 weeks: press X to doubt
if someone steals your food just destroy multiple worldsü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
To Kirbys deffence

He literally a baby. Canonically, he wasent supppsed to wake up for another thousand years as a fully formwd Star Warrior. Meta Knight its sort of what Kirby would be, fully matured and grown.

He seems mindless, sort of because he almost is, the same as most infabts. They dont ask, they just...do.
Hey matpst you do know that Kirby IS A BABY!!!!!!!!!
Is nobody going to mention how the entire purpose of Kirby‚Äôs quest in Triple Deluxe was to save Dedede? Not because he had something Kirby wanted, but because he‚Äôs Kirby‚Äôs friend.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times,  it's getting repetitive. Fool me four times, and well, mabye the series just needs to spice up its general plot structure.


"Fool me 87 times, shame on me"
        -Knuckles the Echidna
I don't know why but l still love Kirby and he's still my favorite Nintendo character
Okay, I have a BIG issue with this theory so far, and that‚Äôs the fact that you‚Äôre very clearly cherry-picking the evidence for ALL of your arguments, and sometimes even distorting the evidence you are using. For example:



03:27 ‚Äúone common thread across ALL of these stories: Kirby is unleashing the threats‚Äù

So... This just blatantly ignores Dreamland 1, Dreamland 2, Dreamland 3, Kirby 64, Amazing Mirror, Triple Deluxe, Planet Robobot, Star allies, and pretty much every spin-off in the series. Kirby‚Äôs not responsible for unleashing the final boss in those games. Only using 4 games, and acting like that‚Äôs a standard across all of them is honestly misleading at best. Not to mention...



 ‚ÄúKirby is creating the problems that he ends up having to solve‚Äù

Throughout all the video so far, you act like there was nothing wrong before Kirby came along. That is WRONG: in Adventure, Kirby intervened because dreams had disappeared. By putting the Star Rod back together, he did unleash Nightmare, but thanks to Kirby, Dreams could return to the world.

In Milky Way wishes, the sun and the moon were already fighting! Marx is obviously the cause of the problems here, not Kirby!

An argument can be made for Return to Dreamland, and Squeak Squad. But that‚Äôs really the only 2 games out of more than 25...



 ‚ÄúKirby doesn‚Äôt act heroically on his own‚Äù

Again, in ALL of the games I listed above, except maybe 64 where he‚Äôs asked for help, and Amazing Mirror where he‚Äôs attacked out of nowhere, Kirby goes out to fight evil all on his own. He realizes something is wrong, sets out to fight whatever power is causing all of these troubles, and he does so alone. Impulsive? Maybe. But not heroic? Definitely not. Not to mention, the only reason why Magolor was able to trick Kirby was because he spontaneously proposed his help to a person in need. If anything that just shows that kirby‚Äôs a nice guy.



 Okay, this is just hypocritical. Using Kirby‚Äôs Avalanche, the ONLY game in the series that is 100% non-canon as it was never even released in Japan, but not even mentioning over 70% of the most important titles because they contradict your argument? Not cool.



 In Kirby‚Äôs Dreamland, not only does King Dedede steals ALL of the food in dreamland, but also all of the Sparkling Stars, making it impossible for anyone to procure food, thus condemning everyone to starvation. How is this comparable to an eating competition in a seemingly isolated mountain?!



 ‚ÄúKirby takes action because Dyna Blade caused an apple to fall on Kirby‚Äôs head‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what the instruction booklet says: ‚ÄúSet out on an epic journey to stop the giant, monstrous bird Dyna Blade from destroying all of the crops.‚Äù I‚Äôll just leave it at that.



So in conclusion... Pretty much none of the arguments listed in this video hold water. I was honestly excited, because there‚Äôs a lot of interesting theories about Kirby with Void Termina and all, but as a big Kirby fan, this is honestly disappointing...



Shoutouts to anyone who read this far XD
Kirby true neutral confirmed
First game I had in the series was Super Star Ultra. Marx still haunts me to this day.
Damn I didn‚Äôt know he was so evil
He‚Äôs not good, he‚Äôs not bad, he‚Äôs just hungry and annoyed.
Kirby fights for a strawberry shortcake.
Me:Can relate
Nobody:
Kirby:  *nom *
Matpat:  MONSTER
What if Kirby ate Zeno, and Zeno inside Kirby‚Äôs stomach destroyed the universe inside Kirby. What would happen
(DBS fans)
BREAKING:
US Naval fleet destroyed in apparent terrorist attack with superweapon - Superweapon seen engulfing cake afterwards
To be honest I now like Kirby even more. Big chaotic neutral energy
The star and moon: are fighting
Kirby:
Strong force of evil: is released
Kirby:
Kirby's cake: 
Kirby: alright, imma bout to head out
The games are still pretty fun thoüòÇüòä
you are kinda right .......


BUT ACTULLY
Kirby is what happens when you give Majin buu a video game
Kirby is god in smash bros no matter who your are fighting he‚Äôs god. PERIOD.also inside Kirby‚Äôs stomach  it‚Äôs an endless dimension
This time, on "All the video game characters you played are evil";
Kirby
God Of Destruction? when did dragon ball super get involved.
Kirby is the man
FANS: aww kirby is a cute hero

MatPat: NOOO!! That is a destructive being!!!!

(Fans throw things at MatPat)
(ACCEDENTLY HIT KIRBY!!)

KIRBY:NO MERCY!!!


then sleeeps
in the chart why dint you label the magic meme wish granting clock (no offence to kirby fans)
as NEUTRAL NEUTRAL D:<
Me: Are any game protagonists actually good?
Game theory: "Well yes but actually no."
Legit shivering
Sakurai..? What happened..?
Kirby didn't know anything about yin-yarn, he just wanted a tomato.
Yo. Could you do a theory about what would've happened if Cybertron was successfully warped to Earth in Transformers Dark of the Moon???
I think Kirby is cute. Thank you for listening to my Ted talk
1. Kirby did not directly cause every problem, Star Allies immediately comes to mind to support this.
2. After Kirby realized Dynablade was a mother, Kirby helped feed and raise her children (which you failed to mention/show).
3. The problems that Kirby DID cause occurred only because Kirby was manipulated by an evil character, Kirby originally intended to solve a different problem that had occurred ( Sun and Moon fighting, everyone being unable to dream, etc.), only to have the real villain swoop in and make things worse, which was able to happen not because Kirby didn't care to ask questions, but because
4. Kirby is canonically an INFANT, (which you also failed to mention/show) meaning he is physically incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, typically follows his instinct, and tends to prioritize food.


Also, in Squeak Squad, Kirby probably assumed Dedede stole his cake because he knows Dedede has stolen food in the past.


Anything I'm forgetting, comment section?
Gotta enjoy these videos now because after article 13 goes into effect this series won't survive
You know it doesn‚Äôt matter what you say Kirby does as it‚Äôs the players choice to hurt characters outside bosses
God of Destruction huh...


Kirby VS. Beerus
Kirby did not know that nightmare needed the star rod üò§ & kirby never knew about Anything every time
Kirby: literally a hungry mindless pink blob that does what it wants. No other description
my friends call me jiggly puff and kirby
Here‚Äôs how matpat chooses his videos.

Matpat: god.... I‚Äôm bored let‚Äôs see..... who‚Äôs childhood I can ruin. Hey steph whatcha playing?

Stephane: oh I‚Äôm playing Kirby‚Äôs dreamla- why are you smiling?

Matpat: STEPHANE I KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TODAY

Stephane: oh Jesus Christ what have I done.

Matpat: is Kirby secretly a sociopath? 

Stephane: HONEY COME ON!! NOT THIS AGAIN!!!
The Kirby anime (and yes, there was one) explains that basically, he‚Äôs a young star warrior. He doesn‚Äôt really know what he‚Äôs doing at all
oh great, that "evil Kirby" thing, I don't think I'll ever sleep well again
is Mario day
MatPat: makes Kirby themed video
Me: ok, that makes sense.
All Kirby Games: Kirb Noises
Kirby's Avalanche: Go meddle in someone else's affairs Squid man
Let's not forget about Marx splitting in half to absorb what is around him üôÇ
The RPG Monger's video: This one sparks joy
This video: This one does not spark joy
Matpat: Kirby is a reincarnated god of destruction 


Beerus: Nani?????
YOU COME INTO MY HOUSE


DISRESPECT MY KIRBY
GaMe ThEoRy Is KiRbY a SoCiOpAtH?
He beats up 
He goes up 
He's over the top 
But most importantly 
He never stops.
So Kirby is a child version of Lord Beerus
Ever considered the fact that Kirby is just a baby?
Get super smash bros ultimate go to the boxing Mach with Kirby and look in the background
Kirby is just gullible and manipulated at the end of Return To DreamLand
Thanos would be so proudüôèüèº‚ò∫Ô∏è
You‚Äôre never gonna change my mind.üòí
Hey kirby, destroy that man , he has ur cake
Kirby: Puyo!
World descends into chaos
He does know that kirby is just a child right? Super gullible and doesn‚Äôt always make good choices?
part 2??
wow super smash bros made Kirby a more popular character

seems legit he's a psychopath
Thats why I always choose Kirby in Smash Bros...
Even Sakurai agrees. He calls his little boy the "Pink Demon".
Third story...
He was hungry... I would be too...
...
wow. that theory was dark. this really umm changed how i am in the kirby fandom. very good.
I was literally eating a tootsie roll pop while watching this
"Becoming more explicit"


Star Allies strait up SAID it
Kirby: Poyo

MatPat: *Screams in Fear*
So is anyone else thinking about THERE WILL BE BRAWL?!?!?!?!
I agree with Kirby on the cake thing. No one should mess with someone else cakeüòÇ I would have done the same for my cake
kirby knows how to give the succ
Kerwin did not know if he was a good or bad guy
Oh no! Dedede stole my strawberry shortcake! Gotta go destroy everyone
kirby knowledge
kirby may unleash the threats...



but he is just baby, he knows no good or bad
So Kirby is the original Majin Buu basically
When you think the theroy has a valid point and support it against all the others that wanna trash it harder that the plate kirby used his cake of EVIL for
Can you do a theory on Super Cat Tales 2?
WHAT ABOUT ALLIES!??? HE IS JUST BEFRIENDING CUTE CHARACTERS!!
Kirby is a hero
Matpat: well yes but not really
Kirby was meant to arrive on popstar thousanf of years later so hes not fully developed like a FETUS and is still a godslayer 
Edit: sorry if this seemed aggresive i was putting my thoughts together
thanks for ruining my childhood....








also.... Kirby is always hungry... that is why he eats a lots of food...
and.... in Kirby star allies.... he defeats the evil version of him.... by friendship... and turns him into a playable character.... by the way..... Kirby says "yes" because he did not even know he is going to be betrayed and he is not a big meanie.... Kirby eats people because.... you know.... if he does not do that.... he will get SMACKED..... please explain why the enemies SMACK Kirby... Even before he does eat them... it is all because king dedede stole the food.... also... how can a HERO steal all the food in the whole dreamland ???? and explain meta knight saying... "DREAMLAND'S LAZY LIFE STYLE WILL END !!!! I WILL RULE !!!!" such heroes... huh ???? PLEASE EXPLAIN....
Come now little ol me a hero? Surely you jestin!
13:11
Did... Did MatPat just call Puyo Puyo a glorified Candy Crush mod?!
So Kirby is kinda the equivalent of Meliodas of the Seven Deadly Sins.
I will never look at Kirby the same way again,thanks Game theory.
Watch meteorz kirby canon vids he disproves matpat
Fool me once
Fool me twice
Fool me three times
Cross the... ah no. (Understand me KH fandom)
You think if Kirby inhales matpat he can ruin childhoods too?
Kirby & Samus... & Star Fox. Same space?
So, a reincarnated god of destruction with the physical make-up of an amoeba with no apparent memory of being said god of destruction. Not that hard to imagine or swallow once you put it out there front and center like that. After watching all of the Buu saga from DBZ first, Kirby being this kind of being is much easier to except.
But if Kirby was the god of destruction how did he kill the god of destructionü§î
MATPAT! THIS VIDEO WAS UPLOADED ON MARCH 10, 2019! AT THE TIME OF POSTING THIS COMMENT, IT IS MARCH 23, 2019! WHERE IS PART 2 OF THIS THEORY!?
Kirby fandom:






OUT OF THIS HOUSE, 
We're is the second episode
Thanks for ruining my childhood xD ;-;
I see that Matpat has been watching Woolie's videos.
Wow Mario is a sociopath, Link is dead, Bowser has abandonment issues, Kirby is a reincarnation of a death god.


Game Theory: Destroying Nintendo one character at a time
everyone is pointing out matpat's mistakes about kirby lore, so i'm gonna point out something: chaotic nuetral, is NOT EVIL. edit: i was just pointing out that nuetral is not evil. i mean, animals are nuetral, and some of them are can be dangerous, do we consider them evil? no, we know they're not smart enough to be evil, they're just.. well, animals. kirby's the same way, except in his case, he atleast is TRYING to be good. heck, i consider him chaotic-good just 'cause he's trying to be good, he's just... not a very good judge of character. sidenote: woah. 255 likes?? wow.. first time i've ever gotten that many... thanks folks! :D
Speaking of superweapons.... What would you do if you had control of the battleship halberd?
WHERE IS PART 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kirby is the Majin Buu of the world of Nintendo. Deceptively adorable, insanely powerful, incredibly gullible and in the end only cares about what he wants before the needs of others.

... And they're fat, pink, can exapnd their mass, have a limited grasp on the human language...
Upload part 2 you c o w a r d
I'd say kirby is more like a very young toddler with the absolute power
You're insane ! Kirby is a sweet blob of cuteness ! üò°üò§
7:32
I'd think so too because he's the one with all the waddle dees.
8:18
I think they were deliberately framing Dedede by hiring a waddle dee minion to steal the cake...


That or Daroach is secretly a waddle dee.
Soo... he is like an amoeba in terms of actions aswell (Not able to think fully behind everything, I don't believe amoebas do anything because they are trying to save the universe but rather to keep themselves alive, and in this case happy)
I always sow him girly but now he is tariffing
Is anyone gonna mention that, according to the anime, Kirby is a negative-200-year-old Star Warrior? That would easily explain his "act first" behavior.
Yea btw I played super smash ultimate in boxer aren and found this
thank you for listening to us and switching gears with this theory. we really appreciate you listening to your fanbase :)
You offended me as a Kirby and Puyo Puyo fanboy.
Hakaishin Kirby. I love it.
Game Character: Exists
Game Theory: Wait, That Illegal
W8 7:06 it said kirby vovo
Only filipinos know did
Isnt kirby just a baby who dost now what is going on ?
"2 part theory"

Part 2 never came.
My favorite part of the intro is when the assassins creed guys face plants onto the fnaf box
Wait but isn't King Dedede the villian?
Wait isn't he a good guy!?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
If you think this is bad try watching something about Kirby super star animated loud sound Warning by terminalmontage
This should have been an extension of why kirby is a single called organism
"One civilian speaks up with a solution: Marx "
Bruh my friends a massive Kirby fan and mains him in smash bros, but when I show him this video, he‚Äôs gonna end up in team meta knight

Edit: Also Kirby is a baby and babys are over exaggerating and always go sicko mode
Not my cute pink protagonist ;-;
Listen MatPat... Kirby just wants his cake, leave him alone üòÇ if I was lured by chocolate cake I would‚Äôve done the same thing
Have you seen the Kirby from Sonic from Hire? That Kirby is insane
Kirby is a Threat




Kirb keeps Dreamland safe
I have one theory: kirby is only a baby with infinite power, that explains all
Video Game Protagonist: exists

MatPat: Interesting theory. Let's test it! Adam Ruins Everything theme plays
MatPat is not posting part 2 because he knows after watching Metorz video that he's WRONG
Well, Kirby is a mood
With the star rod you can‚Äôt float. Also Kirby had no reason to think dedede was in the right
Kirby is Reimu Hakurei confirmed
I mean he does eat the frickin people who live there
This whole theroy is inaccurate due to one tiny little issue you didn't consider...


Enemies Kirby beats up/inhales during normal levels respawn if you go of the screen for a bit then return to the general area. And while Waddle Dees might not try to hurt Kirby, Blade Knights, Sir Kibbles, Burning Leos, minibosses and just about every other enemy you get an ability from inhaling actively does try to hurt if you get to close to them.
WHERE IS PT 2????????????????
F***k Kirby I am triggered again and again 






Sorry Kirby fans
Sorry, but picking on Squeak Squad draws the line for me
Matpat: "Kirby is being taken advantage of"
Also Matpat: "Kirby's willingly being evil"
So I guess part 2 is never coming out, since the Kirby fly video lol
So Kirby is Buu from Dragon Ball... Just rounder, and with less dialog.
‚Äúnext week‚Äù
3 weeks later
Where is part 2
KIRBY IS
--------------------
HITMAN
flashbacks to Super smash Bros brawl's version of gourmet race
Kirby is like Majin Buu...
I remember playing kirby on my DS as a toddler and I would get very 
C O M P E T E T I V E and when I lost I would M E G A  R A G E
Kirby is an Amibo.
This is why I always hated Kirby.
Kirby villain for the 15th time: ‚ÄúI was actually USING you the ENTIRE time!‚Äù

me, a sucker: :0
"Mario is a Sociopath" flashbacks...
Because kirby have no Brain, food is all his life.
I Wanted to be kirby.
I agree in the chaotic neutral, cause that‚Äôs basically Kirby a chaotic neutral revived god who doesn‚Äôt really look at the bigger picture just decides what‚Äôs the best option. Like the all mighty god that he is
Typo: You said Kirby is a girl
proof is at 1.02
Matpat: kirby is evil
comment section Everyone disliked that
Wow.....never realized how much I want to play Kirby...
Kirby is a Majin confirmed
Why does this description of Kirby remind me a lot of the way Majin Buu is portrayed in Dragon Ball Z? 
A terrifying combination of childlike innocence and incredible power without any ability to think about the consequences of their actions. 
At least in his first form, Majin Buu doesn‚Äôt seem to be intentionally malicious and only causes destruction because Babidi told him to do it (very similar to how Kirby never truly intends to do harm but ends up causing it anyway due to his lack of understanding of the world around him).
Hey man, don‚Äôt worry about people getting mad about your theories; you‚Äôre just doing them for fun after all!
I have a cat named Kirby he‚Äôs cute on the outside 






And cute on the inside
AGAIN!¬°
Mat pat remember kirby games are for kids and those are examples of how certen actions have consecuenses in real life and dont take it too hard on him ok = )
(Sry for bad writing its becose im half spanish) PLZ LIKE FOR MP TO SEE~
THANKS FOR DESTORYING MY CHILDHOOD
I wouldn't call King Dede heroic considering I'm pretty sure one game plot involved him raiding the kingdom of it food.

Meta Knight I suppose one could call him that since even when he was the enemy his actions were not malicious if I remember revenge of meta Knight plot accurately.
Well in some points you'r rigth but Think about it, most of the enemies are going to attack with intent to kill him
In some moments It'S self-defense, but still, you're right that it happens
>glorified candy crush mod
How DARE you insult puyo with that trash
I have just one thing to say.






Oh dang.
I don't think Kirby's avalanche is canon
"Rules are rules" IT WAS THE LAW
I liked this theory. Shame a lot of people didn't want a Sequel.
Even in smash on the boxing stage he‚Äôs called the pink devil
Kirby is a force of nature. Calling him evil is like calling Mt Vesuvius evil.
Why does Kirby act so much like Goku  it's actually unbelievable
also i know that you just want fun
but you cant
Dedede makes Kirby drop his cake, and thus penguins went extinct.
Say it with me;




Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
some of the points here are a bit deceiving- like the metamato in kirbys epic yarn: he didn‚Äôt know about the yarn world- the meta mato is what led him to it - pronce fluff then asked for help the problem and kirby agreed
Love the theory MatPat can't wait for part two. It's a cool theory and I hope the dislikes don't make you change your mind about posting part two. I know I'm not the only one that would like to see this through!
Most of those are misunderstandings and Kirby being tricked!!!!!!!
Game theorist: sad gamer
Game terrorist: happy gamer
Game: UgHH
Dude just called Puyo Puyo a glorified candy crush...

And we wonder why sega won't localize any Puyo titles to the West.
I can‚Äôt unwatch that one terminal montage vid
You said that kirby is an amoeba soo... What really is kirby?
Probably people have been hurting kirby all of his life and this is his revenge!
PART 2 PLS
‚ÄúReincarnated God Of Destruction‚Äù
Kirby, Destroyer from the 17th Universe.
(Hopefully someone gets this DBS reference)
A spaceship crashes down into sea of Dreamland with lots of people
Kirby: Welp gotta need a strawberry cake
Leaves like nothing happend
So when's that part 2 coming out? 
I Personally hope this one doesn't become like that Dr.Who film theory did - in that it took almost a year for the next part to come out. Even if it was totally was an amazing release when it finally came out, most of the excitement had died by then. it was still good though.
Kirby certainly is a god in Smash Ultimate.
Technically dark nebula wasn‚Äôt Kirby‚Äôs fault, as the squeaks would have eventually opened the chest anyway. Also in epic yarn the tomato had nothing to do with the whole reason for his quest, instead he willingly chose to help restore peace to patch and Dream land
he's my baby, that's what he is.
The Void Termina's true form in star allies is most likely a form of Kirby created using negative thoughts and energy while Kirby is purely made of positive thoughts and energy.
So Kirby is a reincarnation of one of the gods of destruction from dragon ball?
Noooo I am good boy trust me please
Everybody knows that the true final boss of mww is Galacta Knight - Meta knightmare is the true way to play lol.
So, he isn't the villain
He's just really dumb
Game theory: I‚Äôm taking a week off
Scott: umm about that
1:59
I mean... you‚Äôre describing someone else similar too...
Kirby: Eater of Worlds...
"Anti-Hero"
To be honest i wouldn‚Äôt really care about anything unless someone stole my cake
#buffkirby in smashbros
Can you do a theory on Yoshi sometime? I would like to see that :)
Sounds exactly like majin buu(fat buu)  to me
King dedede is definitely the hero and meta knight
14:20 I've Checked scans of the original Mario instructions.
It says when you break the bricks, you're freeing them from it.
kirby triple deluxe is my favorite game
i still think theres more to this Hmm.. What god of destruction and chaos is kirby descended from?
Welcome to game theory! The show where we can make over analyzing Kirby look cool, the nerdy way.
Okay, imma step up for my boy Kirby here. Who wouldn't kill for their cake? I'd Murder anyone.
Kirby isn‚Äôt evil, he‚Äôs just stupid and reckless
Meh Kirby was never my favorite character
So kirby is beerus from another timeline ü§î
I did not know how evil Kirby is
Isn‚Äôt Kirby a baby?üòÖ
MatPat: It's over, Kirby
I have the high ground.
Kirby: You underestimate my power!
Amoebas are God‚Äôs of destruction...?





I knew it
The Game Conspiracy Therorists.
The fact Kirby is an infant disproves 80% of the video.
"Not caring about good or evil or what he's fighting for, just what strikes him in the moment"
"Kirby doesn't have a clue of what's really going on"
"King Dedede literally has to LAUNCH him to get him to take any action"
Yeah, those are pretty childlike behaviors.
‚ÄúTheory for next week‚Äù
Mentions how Kirby fell for Magolor, Marx, Dark Nebula and Nightmare's tricks

Fails to mention how in Kirby 64 if Kirby didn't automatically trust Ribbon and then pull together the crystal shards, Zero two would have destroyed the universe


There fixed it
dude kirby is a baby that was supposed to keep flying through space for 2000 more years but was drawn to fight against the nightmare soo... he's a a baby




god did you even watch the anime
You really didn't get the point, did you all?


MatPat didn't mean that Kirby is evil by nature and if he wanted he'd destroy everything.
He meant that Kirby is an easy target of MANIPULATION.


An example: Kirby many times standed against evil because he was directed to be by his friends, but if an evil-intented person managed to manipulate Kirby to do the wrong thing (like destroy everything in his path), there would be no hope for Popstar and the rest of the galaxy.


Because when Kirby is directed to somewhere that is either evil or good, 
This video was amazing!! Please do the second part anyway
Your doing a lot of build up in this episode.  You mention all these ‚Äòomens‚Äô but you‚Äôve - quite distinctively - left the results / correlation out of your assessments.

This bothers me because you‚Äôve been doing a lot of generalizations short of conclusive theorizing.

The ‚Äòassassins leap of faith‚Äô was redirected to gravity side effects when you could have sought after the survivability of a haystack.

In ‚ÄòLink vs hook-shot‚Äô you assumed he was static before and after deployments.  Living flesh is adaptive towards such diversity.  Exceptions are a medical normalcy.
Kirby's Adventure.
He didn't know he was unleashing the evil, but Meta Knight supposedly did and supported it. Dedede may have tried to save everyone, but destroying Nightmare and going back to having pleasant dreams needed to happen. Kirby may have unleashed him, but he needed to to bring back the dreams to dreamland.



There was no way for Kirby, nor his friends to know what was happening. Although it was a huge mistake, the end result was making a new friend in Magalor, as well as destroying the Master Crown for good.



Destorying Nova isn't necessarily a bad thing. We've seen from both Super Star and Robobot that clockwork stars have no morals. They are willing to help the bad guy. Star Dream specifically misinterprets Haltmann's wishes and tries to destroy the universe.



Squeak Squad's story was honestly pretty bad. Everyone was uncharacteristic of themselves. Especially Meta Knight, who went from barely knowing Kirby in Adventure, yet training him to fight Nightmare, to trying to hide Dark Nebula with no explanation. He doesn't explain that it's an evil power that must be stopped, or prevented from escaping, he just swipes the chest and runs away. Let's chalk this up as a bad day for everyone.
also, not to mention that Kirby himself didn't open the chest, the Squeak Squad did. Meaning if Kirby didn't get involved, Dark Nebula would've escaped anyways, and Kirby would have to jump into action without the experience of the adventure that he went through in the actual story.


The argument that Kirby has to be forced to do anything is flawed. Dedede isn't forcing Kirby to help, he is aiding Kirby's fight back. Kirby was shocked, but Dedede calmed down enough to snap him back into it.


In Meta Knight's Revenge, Kirby destroys the halberd, but... everyone escapes. The only harm done is the Halberd is gone.
Meta Knight's plan failed, but in the end, he probably saw how Dreamland isn't as lazy as he thought they were. It was almost like a test to see if they were willing to fight for their freedom.
The credits of Revenge of Meta Knight is very different from the rest of the Super Star sub-games. Instead of credits, we get a showcase of all of the helpers that can help Kirby on his quest. Kirby didn't do this alone, he used the help of his friends to save the day. Proving to Meta Knight that he was wrong, and that Dreamland is not helpless.


Kirby's Avalanche is likely not canon. it's just a skin of puyo puyo with throwaway dialogue.


as far as we know, none of the normal enemies in Dreamland 3 were possessed. They probably weren't. they were actively attacking Kirby.
Sure one of the biggest flaws with any of this is that Kirby is willing ot attack helpless Waddle Dees who aren't even attacking, but that's the player's choice, and when it is forced, it's usually for humor. I doubt Kirby would actually go on a killing spree.


Dyna Blade is at fault for ravaging Dream Land. Kirby is also at fault for fighting back. But as we see in the end, if Dyna Blade would've just asked for help, Kirby would've been happy to help.


I'm sure part 2 will be better, as it will delve into a subject that doesn't have much information yet in canon lore... Void Termina. I think Mat Pat is stretching far too much, but it'll be interesting to see how he feels about Void.
where is part 2?
Kirby is a child, completely innocent, he literally has no context for right or wrong, hes mr buu
I wonder is matpat ever watched meteorz video on kirby
i watched a 20 mins long ad for u matpat. i hope it was worth it.
Oh dear, you bring up moments from games to help your argument while at the same time ignoring moments wich prove Kirby is not bad, the series has almost 20 games (with canon story, counting every game it has over 40) and in how many of those games is Kirby directly responsible of unleashing some kind of evil? 4? Maybe 5? Yes he makes mistakes at times and can be simple-minded, but he never does it with bad intentions, the problem he has is that he helps everyone in need and doesn't asume others are evil until proven mistaken because he is young, being easily manipulated doesn't mean you are bad, just naive and you trust people very easily, and yes every Kirby fan knows about the cake incident, that was kind of dumb, that's the only one i can't really justify, outside that he is young.

Also you Say he never jumps into acction unless there is some sort of incentive, and that's just false, Triple Deluxe, he saw the dreamstalk lift his house and Dedede's castle and went to investigate, and after seeing Dedede getting kidnaped he gave chase to rescue his friend and along the way he saved the people of the sky, Planet Robobot, he saw an invading race attacking Dreamland and mechanizing it si he took action to stop it along with other examples.

With the Halberd, how over dramatic are you?, After Meta Knight gave the comand evacuate the ship his crew stayed because they wanted to defeat Kirby, and yes Meta Knight said they would perish if they tried, but  just a few screens later after their defeat the crew said they would evacuate the ship and they apologized to MK for not being able to beat Kirby, so no, Kirby is not seing a "ship full of people crash killing everyone inside", by the time Kirby and MK escaped that ship was empty or at least there is no proof that someone died inside you are just asuming.

As for Dinablade, no he didn't chase after her because "she woke me up from my nap so she is going to pay", he was waken up by a giant bird causing panic qnd destroying stuff so he stopped her, and after defeating her, seeing her true intentions, he took care of the babies, fed them, taught them how to fly and in the end returning them to her mother who was so gratefull and forgiving that she hepled Kirby in the events of Revenge of Meta Knight.

Man i love you and your videos, but this one is such a strech, yes Kirby can be simple-minded and makes mistakes from time to time, but he is far from a careless weapon of mass destruction that only runs on basic incstinct, he always tries to help those in need ant tries his hardest to help his friends and to fix the mistakes he makes, he is just easily manipulated
Wait so kirby is basically one of those greek mitology gods that are in our 6th grade book?
Damn Kirby. You still my main in Smash tho
4:53 Well, in Europe it is called "Kirby's Adventure Wii".
I‚Äôm mad I‚Äôll never see the part two :c
Well, who wouldn't become violent if your cake is stolen, hmm?

Edit: oh i never got so many likes before! Thanks to all of you!
He sounds like he is majin boo from dragon ball z
GAH THAT

THUMBNAIL!!
I HATE LOOKING AT IT!!
Dark Matter for smash
Skins:
Dark matter,Dark nebula, dark mind,Void terminus,Void terminus Ex,Void,Dark matter swordsman(DIFFERENT play set),and zero.Share this message with Nintendo
just because he's a bit stubborn I don't think he's evil matzot :3
It feels so good hearing that Dedede is a more heroic character than Kirby
Wait, what's the game where Kirby's pouring hot sauce onto thedish?
What about Kirby in subspace emissary
Kirby's numblies weren't mentioned ='(
Chaotic Neutral


Edit: I didn't watch the whole video
Hey, resident Kirby fanatic here. Today I'm gonna go over just about everything MatPat got wrong. I know I'm not the first and I hope I'm not the last.

1:45 This is the first time you used fan-made Kirby Star Allies box art and it also isn't the last.
 King Dedede shattered the Star Rod and Kirby seeks to reassemble it because he believes that it will restore dreams when placed in the fountain. At this point in the series, King Dedede has been Kirby's oldest rival. So naturally, after he tries fighting Kirby yet again and loses, Kirby is inclined to push forward despite the King's wishes. After all, this is the same guy who's been stealing food and generally been acting like a jerk. I don't think most heroes would believe the villain after years of torment.
 Magolor is found in a ship that was literally crashing and burning (or smoking) at the beginning of the game. All Kirby and the player knows is that an evil-looking dragon with an evil crown just tried to kill Magolor. Magolor was also extremely kind to Kirby throughout the adventure. He cheers him on and offers to take him on what seemed like an exotic vacation for the latter half of the game.
 This is one of many times you mention that Kirby is essentially murdering innocents, which is far from the truth. Most Waddle Dees injure him, Bronto Burts fly directly towards you in most games, and every other enemy has some sort of attack that they directly use to hurt you, such as Waddle Doo's beam and Sir Kibble's cutter blade.
 Nova can be seen hurtling towards Popstar and colliding with both the Sun AND Moon prior to the fight. If the Sun & Moon hadn't held Nova off and if Kirby didn't destroy it, Popstar could've faced a catastrophic collision with a giant celestial automaton with an explosion that could rival the likes of a superNOVA (Keep in mind that an explosion of this same caliber ended up knocking out Kirby and totaling his robot in the climax of Planet Robobot).
 You say that the Squeak Squad stole the cake. Although the player is also lead to believe this for most of the game, this is not the case. In fact, a waddle dee can be seen snatching the cake for about a single frame in the first cutscene. But I won't fault you for using Kirby beating up Dedede first as evidence.
 Kirby ate the tomato because it resembles his favorite food, Maxim-Tomatoes. When he's transported to Patchland, he's informed of Yin-Yarn's evil plans and he goes on a quest to stop him with Prince Fluff.
 Essentially waging war against people who are lazy in a place literally called "Dreamland" isn't at all heroic, hence why Kirby blows up the  Halberd. You don't exactly casually park a battleship somewhere with the intention of peacefully conquering someplace.
 The Meta-Knights aren't dead. They can be seen alongside Meta Knight when he uses one of his specials in Planet Robobot. Its unconfirmed if Sailor Waddle Dee survived.
 Kirby's Avalanche is a reskin of a Puyo-Puyo game. Please don't take this as concrete canon evidence, especially considering that Kirby acts wildly out of character in this game.
 Said "mysterious, dark substance" can be seen possessing multiple people. And again, enemies still hurt Kirby.
 Considering that all the food is aligned and Kirby and Dedede are partaking in a race that includes a start and finish line as well as a friendly waddle dee to signify the race's beginning, I'd say that this was likely an organized race, meaning that all this food racing is in good nature and approved by others.
 The giant evil bird that is terrorizing everyone's crops flies by and wakes you from your sleep. Of course Kirby is going to stop it. Upon defeating Dyna Blade, he realizes that she is a mother and attempts to help her newborn children. Later on, Dyna Blade can be seen helping Kirby stop Meta Knight in Meta Knightmare.

For the love of god do your research please. You have such a wide audience of people who you could be introducing to fandoms such as this one and rather than making a good effort to give a quality summary of the series' mysteries, you continue to spread misinformation. Its especially worse considering that you basically took a bunch of stuff out of context or cut important scenes short just to prove your point. Half the time it doesn't even seem like you actually sat down and watched/played a good chunk of these games. Oh and next time you steal some random boxart from Google Images, post the source.
Kirby is a mercenary, he kills when he must, kills if he doesn't need to, just to get the job done.
Then the next few games you expect Kirby to just trust them. I know I wouldn't. Actually now that I think about Kirby is most of the time alone with no one to help
I very much disagree with a lot of this theory. I feel that you ignored a lot of different context clues in order to fit your theory like puzzle pieces. Like for instance, like for instance. In Revenge of metaknight, the halberd is clearly a weapon built for mass destruction. They were not going to do anything good with that. Also it‚Äôs not metaknight who is the main commander of the ship, he is simply one of the many executives. Meteorz video goes a lot into a lot of other details, but in total honesty I kind of expected better from you at this point. Even as a professional channel now you still leave a lot of puzzle pieces out of the conclusion to make your theory seem more solid, rather than saying, ‚Äúhey but this may be the case too.‚Äù On top of that, I expected you to put such ideas already into the video rather than a longwinded comment.
He is my favourite God of destruction
Matpat, you‚Äôre completely ignoring the fact that Kirby is literally a baby in the canon. He doesn‚Äôt know anything about anything because he can‚Äôt even spell his own name. He only cares eating and sleeping and he only has a one track mind because he is still an infant. You can say that Kirby is mindless, but you can‚Äôt say that he is willingly evil and ignorant until he actually ages and grows up in canon to become something that is closer to a full grown adult or even just a teenager and if he is still doing stuff like what you mentioned then that‚Äôs fine, but until that happens, this theory is invalid.
Kirby is the pink demon
Magalor didn't become powerful because of the Crown. The Crown became powerful because of Magalor.
I knew I used Kirby in Smash for a reason.
But what about kirby 64
Sorry Matpat, but there‚Äôs a lot here to disprove this theory. For one, Kirby is a child. Even if the anime isn‚Äôt canon, it‚Äôs clear Kirby is not as intelligent as Meta Knight or Dedede. Dedede owns a castle and an Army, and Meta Knight is able to both own a battleship and a fleet. Both are shown to talk (as seen in Super Star Ultra) and both are knowledgeable on dangers to Popstar.
Kirby, on the other hand, has never been shown to talk outside of screams and ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù‚Äôs. Kirby is never shown to lead any building or lead any army. It‚Äôs clear Kirby is not as smart as either of Dedede or Meta Knight. 
With that in mind, it makes sense why Kirby falls for the same trick over and over and over again. He‚Äôs a child, or at least, not the sharpest tool in the shed. And when you‚Äôre young, you easily fall for the same trick twice, or four times. 
Secondly, Kirby DOES fight for others without food being involved. In Triple Deluxe, he wants to rescue Dedede from Taranza. In Robobot he wants to stop the robotic alien invasion. Even in games you mentioned, like Adventure, he wanted to return dreams to the planet of Popstar. And in Squeak Squad, when the cake is stolen, slowing down the footage shows a Waddle Dee-esk figures stealing the cake. Thinking that a Waddle Dee stole it, it‚Äôd be reasonable to assume that Dedede stole the cake, cuz waddle dees are loyal to Dedede. So he DIDN‚ÄôT attack Dedede without reason. 
None of Kirby‚Äôs actions are inherently evil. Misguided? Sometimes. But not deliberately. He is a child who fights for his own reward, as children do, and fights for others and his friends. 
I love your vids man, but I really gotta disagree with this one.
I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt done a theory on Rayman like how his limbs don‚Äôt fall off
Well didn‚Äôt the King originally steal food from the inhabitants years prior which made Kirby take him down the first time? I mean if you are known for stealing food and you have a grudge on a certain pink puff ball it‚Äôs kind of a go to answer when you think about it
Also didn‚Äôt Knight want to make the world less lazy by starting a WAR
I can't wait until part 2
BEST INTRO EVER
You can go through Kirby games without killing dedede‚Äôs soldiers
Sorry but, can you do a theory on who is ,"canonically", the strongest fighter in Super Smash Bros Brawl?

My bet is on Kirby since he's a destroyer of worlds.
Ever thought about how Kirby may be destructive... but he‚Äôs still a baby? Hmm
Am I crazy or do I hear a Doctor Who theme-like song in the background around 14:44?
Cedar :: Kirby
Oi lads
Meteorz has entered the arena
Bro, Kirby are you ok?
I love your intro.
I under stand why kirby would fight for food
They should make a dedede game where the final boss is Kirby
Mat Pat when are we getting Part 2?
Those are some very violent, innocent bystanders
NEXT WEEK
Still waiting after 11 days
If Kirby really is an amoeba, it has no reasoning abilities and the concept of survival in the most basic form is the end goal.  Nukes, guns, and bioweapons have no concept of morality.  
Just food (cake?) for thought.
Matpat is already wrong.

Kirby ‚â† a god.
Kirby > God.

Kirby's killed several godlike entities. He's clearly above godhood at this point.
[B]take it back
well all the impulsive selfishness makes sense given that canonically kirby is a baby. he is a baby star warrior (same race as meta knight)
6:26 I thought he was gonna create Marxism
Hey mat! If I made a game called ‚ÄúKirby‚Äôs Realization‚Äù would you play it?
But, Kirby is a baby. Most babies/ very young kids will do what they‚Äôre told. And if you take some from a kid, they aren‚Äôt just going to sit there. Since Kirby is an over powered baby (with no parents), this outcome is only expected.
So in a way kirby is kind of just an alone confuse boy who has to act on his instinct
Who knew my childhood could just float away like that
you know i don't think your taking kirby the 8'' tall emeba god of destruction SERIOUSLY. you take him as nieve - yet hes trying to save dreamland? how can you save it ; if everyone guarding the big bads - are looking more like nitemares ? ? ?  so you see he intended to unlock them... (Death Trance)  ... woddle dee & woddle duu NOT CANNON


THE NATURE OF KIRBY ? HES A CHAMPIAN NOT A HERO
i think this is why pac-man and the ghostly adventures was a show
What do you expect from kirby he has the mind of a newborn baby??
Exactly what Sakurai thought
"Cute on the outside, but dark on the inside." (2:01) Dude, you just cut a pink fluff ball in half. Who you calling dark?
When isn‚Äôt food Kirby‚Äôs motivation though ü§î
give us a part 2
The problem is he is a gullible child. remember how when we are kids we dont care about anything in the world, just our apetites and feelings?  The main problem about kirby is that he is an orphan. he has no parents that care about him or guide him in the right direction. He has no parents that will keep him away from bad influences and such he gets manipulated easily. Its the parents responsibility to keep their children away from potential bad influnces  that the children wont know about until they grow older.
give us a part 2
give us a part 2
To late

I already bought star allies
Man, as cute as Kirby is, he sure is genocidal
So...kirby pretty much is a naive, hungry and impulsive alien because...cake?...Sounds like my dnd character.
A love that f*cking theme song
Dope intro
Kirby Star Allies 2016-2018
Atleast we can say Kirby stands up for equal rights.
I mean, if I was Kirby i'd only care about the cake too
Naw you can't really change my mind of Kirby
I remember that in the cartoon Meta Knight did not trust Kirby.
Yeah but he's cute tho
Mat pat isn‚Äôt Kirby trying to fix the problem?
So this is what happened after World of Light...
meta knight tried to conquist dream land as a dictator
Is Kirby a mutant Metroid?
But, after all, if Kirby adventure, if Kirby would have done nothing, nobody in dream land would be able to dream again.
If Kirby wouldn¬¥t have help Magolor, maybe he would have defeat lanfia himself and take over planet while kirby didn¬¥t know a think.
And for Dyna blade....well dyna blade is still alive so....
I have another theory, Kirby is being controlled by someone or something. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so clueless at boss battles. That‚Äôs probably also why he just carelessly destroys things
I AM SO MADE THE PUZZLES ARE PUYO PUYO
Hey I Love you guys but please make a part 2 to this, I can't go through waiting and waiting like I did for the Mass Effect episode 2 PLEASSSSEEE
Yes KIRBY KIRBY is evil
If kirby does everything for cake, can we tell him what to do if we have cake?
We need a theory to clobbah dat dere Kirby
WHERE'S PART TWO MATPAT?
I think it would make more sense that Kirby would be a deity of life or chaos. Life because it is a cycle that requires death, and chaos because well you already said.
Kirby's behavior and mindset can easily be explained with the fact that he is a mere baby, whereas Meta Knight and Dedede are much more mature and reasonable
Man I love your intro... What song do you use for it?
Game theory before: Kirby is a single celled organism
Game theory now: KIRBY IS A GOD OF PURE DESTRUCTION!!!
Vera slepoj is correct.
Metors prove ya wrong
The last one / fourth time makes me think of how Erza from fairy tail.
Kirby's rule 34 turned me on
In the anime series metaknight  says that kirby was made by nightmare but kirby refused to be evil
hey this was uploaded on my bday!
Can we ban matpat from YouTube for calling a tootsie pop a ‚Äútootsie roll pop‚Äù
Nah Kirby is a destructive amoeba
14:34
A Kirby video released on Mario day (Mar10)



Great video though.
"for next week"
I'm excited for the next part of this theory!
Rip Kirb memes
I'm still okay with this üëå
0:55 
Scarfies can't be inhaled therefore your theory is incorrect.
Kirby was designed to be like this, not the stereotypical hero.
This is about equivlent to Peta making fun of Steve Irwin isn't it?
"Only Nintendo franchise to feature a naked woman"

Ever played Yoshi's Island before?
Ugh. i can actually explain why kirby IS a hero, but i think Meteorz did it better then i could.
14:48 But here comes T series.
I'm sorry but I can't imagine Kirby yelling out, "H A K A I"
kiRBy iS My sMaSh mAIn
I believe your trying to put two puzzle pieces together from two different puzzles
Kirby, confirmed sociopath ,Shawn Dawson.
Completely glosses over the fact that kirby is a baby that has no idea what's going on but scary stuff.
He IS a threat! I love Kirby, but I've also always noticed he's fighting AGAINST the good guys in the first half of most games... He isn't smart enough to use his powers for good on his own, he has to be aimed that direction by someone he likes...
He. Is. A. Threat.
16:23 apparently also an amoeba.
So Kirby is a sociopath is what I‚Äôm hearing.
Here is one strong counterargument to this video. Cannonically Kirby is very young. Like within his toddler years. He probably doesn't know right from wrong that well.
If you ask me, Kirby is an innocent, gluttonous, foolish, and ignorant child with zero evil intent. Along with that, children usually DO resort to violence.
Why didn‚Äôt I get notified of this xD, I have got that bell active tho
So the enemy are the hero saving the world from kirby?
"If you think that its upsetting that Kirby is turning out to be a force for evil" No MatPat, After watching Mario burn up (R.I.P. Mario :( ), This is VERY FFUUUNNN!!! XD MUA HA HA (sorry Kirby fans)
I love kirby even more now.
Kirby: "Saves not only Popstar a disproportionate amount of times but the whole universe as well"
Matpat: "Is he actually a villain???"
The God of Destruction reincarnated as an amoeba
In the back round it sand Kirby ‚Äúthe pink demon‚Äù
Lol so today my teacher was using YouTube today and thus video popped up on her suggestions  and we all pointed it out
I think that modern Kirby games final bosses are a bit less nightmare fuel than the original ones, but a bit more bad LSD trip like
Kirby is naive, nearly completely pure, and doesn‚Äôt seem to fully understand the difference between good and evil; despite this, while it seems he may descend from the Dark Matter species, he chooses to be on the side of good when he finally realizes what‚Äôs going on.
Kirby is the god of destruction of his universe
Who else coming back before the next part?
Also he loves LOVES LOVES LOVES LOVES LOVES food also you could make an argument of how he is a hero
This might be a mass effect mistake all over again cause he said 2 parts but only release one part
Kirby would never do this im shaking and crying rn
WHERE THE HELL IS PART 2?!?!? ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS!!!!!
b-b-b-but...
Kirby the pink demon
NO IT'S NOT TRUE TELL ME THIS GOOD BOY IS GOOD TELL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!  }:<()
Kirby is a child! He doesn‚Äôt know any better
Meteorz disagrees.
I JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHIPPED AND NAE NAED!
Theory on shadow of colossus and ico pleaseeee
Hey, no one ever said Kirby was the brightest.
This entire video upset Kirby and his fanbase immensely.
laughs in Kirby 64
I agree with mat pat.
OMG Kirby is related to beeris
WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT ME YOU LITTLE
Matpat: "God of Destruction"



Beerus: 
matpat, when will you team up with kyle? from because science
i will never see him the same way again
Matpatt $$$ you
When's the next part?
Non-canon spinoffs.
Taking events out of context.
Ignoring Canon games because they go against your point.
Sad! No happy egg!
When‚Äôs part 2?
part 2?
cutest effing sound 7:02
To be fair kirby is basically a todler
I think a lot of people take these theories way to seriously. I mean obviously we know that Kirby isn‚Äôt evil, Mario isn‚Äôt evil, every game character isn‚Äôt evil. It‚Äôs just fun to try and create a different narrative. Don‚Äôt take it too seriously guys and have fun.
So... Are we getting a part 2 to this video, Matpat?
Where my second part?
So Kirby is Majin Buu. Guess that Death Battle wasn‚Äôt too far off
Part 2 next week? Its been over two weeks mane
2:46
Beerus: who are you?
Kirby:Poyo(im you but hungrier)
When is part 2 coming out
Kirby sounds a lot like Deadpool.
People are trying to make kirby fans mad
So Kirby is a  bony hunter he has to be paid to work with cake
It could be that Kirby is just easly manipulated
15:16 Kirby: How dare you wake me!
"then it sucked kirby up"...definitely needs an adult rating
No cheesey intro?
One of the best ones so far, but some details were left out like how the baby birds were taken care of by Kirby.
Kirby truly is the definition of chaotic neutral
EVERYONE GO TO METEORZ AND SEE HIS VIDEO THAT DESTROYS THIS THEORY
Ah so Matt ( the childhood destroyer ) pat has returned to his old tricks again
My first game in smash with my cousins was kirby you broke my gaming heart
This all explains the total Kirby ban in my friends Smash games..
Long answer:this video

Short answer:kirby is hercules
i'm still waiting for part 2
In Dream Land 1, when DeDeDe sweeps the problem of Nightmare under the rug by breaking the star rod, Kirby actively seeks the pieces out to destroy Nightmare (and destroying the star rod gets rid of dreams or something)
I might be miss-remembering Squeak Squad, but I don't remember Kirby being the reason Dark Nebula was released. If memory serves, the leader of the squeaks would have opened the chest regardless of if Kirby had been there or not. I could be wrong on this though, seeing as I haven't played that game in many years. If i'm wrong, I wouldn't mind someone more knowledgeable correcting me on it
Is this a gravity falls theory? The dark nebula reminds me of someone.
This is Mario is a communist all over again
I‚Äôm the Kirby anime he was actually made by nightmare as a monster for mass destruction
What is matpat smoking cuz I want some
Kirby is my spirit animal, it's official
Too bad we'll never get part 2..
I'm pretty sure Kirby is just supposed to be na√Øve
WHERE IS PART 2!?!?!?!?!?!?!
im gonna have to stop you there
"Sigh" ahhh Kirby wow just wow
Pt 2 coming never
Me: Pulls out every episode of right back at ya. Wanna talk about not canon HmMMmMMMMMMMMmMmmM?
So basically, Kirby is a sadistic chaotic neutral character. He gets pissed off really easily, which is dangerous considering his powers.
Game theory: Is Viridi actually Samus Aran!?  #episode suggestion
Your brain is so Deep and crazy
FINALLY ANOTHER KIRBY THEORY!
Kirby is a god of destruction stuck in a frickin single celled baby. This makes total sense.
When is part 2 coming?
i think that ain't kirby's character that's just him being surrounded with a bunch of fakes and him being easy to be convinced
Man, you really know how to make compelling theories, Mat. No wonder you have 11,000,000 subs.
I still love Kirby
You know, if Kirby had not replaced the star rod and unleashed nightmare, the inhabitants still would have had nightmares, which is was kirby was trying to prevent.

Also, Kirby freed both Landia and Magalor, who were possessed. They both later become good guys because he beats the evil right out of them

ALSO ALSO, if Kirby hadn‚Äôt gone through the planets of Milky Way wishes, the sun and moon would still have fought, ALSO the nova would still have existed which were known to be manipulated and used for the wrong reasons

If you don‚Äôt understand, if Kirby didn‚Äôt unleash these evils in the first place, they would have been there for someone else to deal with



If you want an example of him fighting for good, look at Triple Deluxe. DeDeDe is kidnapped because the kidnapper thinks he is Kirby. Kirby doesn‚Äôt have to do anything, he‚Äôs still at peace and not affected by the events. But no, he climbs the dreamstalk to save DeDeDe and the people of the land. Also, he risks his life to stop Meta Knight from taking over dreamland with his giant ship of mass destruction, the halberd. In that same game, he returns the food if dreamland to its inhabitants who go hungry after it is stolen and he defeats a giant bird terrorizing the people

Kirby didn‚Äôt even know Yin Yarn was going around, so how would he have helped


Also, you say Meta Knight is helping preventing the evil, BUT DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME DEDEDE STOLE ALL OF THE FOOD LEAVING THE PEOPLE TO STARVE. Also, Meta Knight is forcing his beliefs onto the people of dreamland. The people in the halberd are trying to kill him. Do you also think it‚Äôs okay to steal the food of people just to feed your kids? NO! Dyna blade didn‚Äôt ask for help, yet Kirby STILL helped her babies because they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong 

ALSO ALSO ALSO What are you going to do with a bunch of possessed people trying to kill everyone, he technically saves them.


I just can‚Äôt stand you saying Kirby attacks Dyna blade for revenge. He literally wakes up to see the bird attacking the crops and he helps. Would you rather he sit back and do nothing?!

Somehow, you got the fact right that kirby is a reincarnated being, but I‚Äôm CONFIDENT you won‚Äôt explain it incorrectly
even if it costs my life i will forever love him
Sounds like

Beerus
Does someone know the theme of this intro?
11:10 Nice
‚ÄúHow many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man!?‚Äù
Hello theory-gamers!Speaking of kirby,i remembered of it appearing on the intro of Super Smash Bros Ultimate - World of Light,going on the warp star faster than the light that got shot by Galeem.and you can see,FASTER THAN LIGHT,so fast it even TELEPORTED!I got impressed and thought of asking YOU to do a video talking about HOW the warp star goes so fast and the consequences of riding it


I hope you read this!
WTF wat have you done too Kirby
Deities don't necessarily have to be evil, no matter how much you condition me in the preface.
Where part two you stuck on film theorey Matpat
Acording to Kirby canon,  Kirby is basically a good void 



Edit: swapped dark matter with void, I realized my mistake, I‚Äôm sorry(although they are both kinda similar)
I'm rather interested in seeing more of this.
lol i bought kirby triple deluxe the day i watch this video...help.
12:45 What i say to people xd
Kirby really needs to stop and just hear the carfax
What? No cringe worthy intro joke? Who are you? You aren‚Äôt MatPat! Nani?!?!
Why is DD bunkering superweapon ? Is the anime part of the Canon of Kirby games ?
KIRBY IS A REINCARNETED LOR OF DISTROCTION !!!!!!
I thought that Kirby  was cute and all but when I was this video I was so angry
Dark matter can be made of either good or evil. Void termina was bad cos that's how he was incarnated. Both gooey and Kirby are positive examples of dark matter. And Kirby isn't evil, he's a gullible little child who's helping his friends. It's not he was doing any bad by defeating void termina, or trying to help magolor. Bad guys are bad guys.
First Mario is a sociopath, then Peach as a ruler of parasitic mushroom, now Kirby is evil... Next you'll tell me that Rosalina wants to destroy the universe...







(no, but really cool episode)
:)
R.i.p all characters in smash bros.
How was Kirby born
Still waiting for part 2
I have one question how come in some games the D's are with Kirby in Sum they're not
Nobody:
MatPat: "ACTUALLY KIRBY IS BEERUS"
I knew that Marshmallow was no good.
i swear matpat loses more and more of his sanity with every video
hey matpat just because the fan a franchise has a ridiculously insane story doesn't mean Kirby does or any other thing that was for that matter, you keep taking it to the extreme ever since the whole finaf thing came up, it's time to stop!! I'm not just talking about the meme.
So Kirby destroys mindlessly until the task is done, eh? What do you expect from an ameoba!
Well, pretty cool but...
What about Triple Deluxe MatPat?
What about the game about saving dedede?
Despite the fact the show paints him showing more emotion and empathy it could be argued "Kirby Right Back at Ya!" also reinforces Kirby not being the most noble of heroes too, I recall several times he had to be convinced and pushed to fight the monster of the week.
Matpat (inhales deeply) HE IS A BAYBE HE DOES NOT KNOW ANY BETTER HAVE YOU WATCHED THE ANIME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Also if you don‚Äôt do anything with the enemy‚Äôs they kill you so they are evil
Kirby did take care of the kids in dynablade
Kirby: Hosts some of the most constructed lore in a kids game.

MatPat: Pink Man Bad :^|
PART TWO PLEASE
That's also an amoeba
Kirby: smashes everyone ever
„Éï„Ç°„ÉÉ‚Åâ
Nobody:

MatPat: Okay so today I‚Äôm going to tell you about how ANOTHER one of your favorite childhood heroes is actually a super evil villain who wants to take over the universe and kill everything!
Why was this so controversial? I thought it was a fun thought.
Part 2...?
I refreshed the comments section and watched it go from 18k to 17k well if that‚Äôs not sus
You don't nessicarily have to kill everyone to beat his games though.
Hes a child. He doesnt mean to be destructive. He just wants to help. Hes always clueless. Theres no real motive.
Wean is part 2?
Meteorz did a better job.
Hello part 2?
A few questions about the content of your video: Why would you photoshop your head onto Princess Peach? Did you just cut Kirby in half with a sword? Are you implying that the series should be played differently now?
Anyone else liked it when it was JUST MatPat
2 weeks passed. Still no part 2...
Well to be honest, Kirby is still considered a hero based on the fact that he does save the day. Nobody says a hero has to have everyone‚Äôs best interest at heart, however it is a good quality to have. The portion where u mention Kirby being concerned about his strawberry cake for example. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with that, especially if in the end he still saves the day. His motives weren‚Äôt inherently evil or villainous so that‚Äôs a terrible example. Also the 4 times Kirby was misguided by the true main enemy wasn‚Äôt a good piece of evidence on ur end. Each scenario was different, so the fact that he was tricked those 4 times can‚Äôt be held against him in that sense. Maybe if it was the same exact plot being repeated then yeah I can see that logic. He merely is inadvertently aiding the enemy as they try to manipulate him. One last thing, ur taking player choice into account for this theory. Outside of boss battles, in most Kirby games u can choose to either kill or ignore most enemies in game. It‚Äôs all up to the player and how they choose to play in that moment.
Why is everyone hating on Kirby
Mat pat you are making me to think about getting rid of my Kirby games
i like kirby i consider him to be one of my closest friends
were is part 2?
"Kirby assumes that it was dedede!"
Uh matpat dedede stole food from Kirby and dreamland like two times
14:57 m9? dont you mean  m8?
OMG...
2:24 "69, heheheheheheheheheheheheheh"
7:35 oh no Kirby look out it‚Äôs king d√¶dedd
Lol is this the next ‚ÄúMario is a psychopath‚Äù series? üòÇüòÖ
I do feel like if you put the anime canon in which he was woken up too early before he became an actual warrior like Meta Knight, you can treat him more as a baby with god-like powers which explains the chaotic behavior
That's just a elevator pitch!
Kirby didnt know that nightmare would appear if he Brantley the star rod back
Well yeah Kirby is a mindless creature how ever he is a baby which always puzzled me but yeah
Part 2: Kirby is Sans, who is also Ness
Kirrby is RUINED
Ha! I still love Kirby! Very interesting though. And I just realized that this was posted on my birthday! XD Thanks for ruining my childhood LOL jk :-D
This was good for the first 3 minutes but than this became Sans is Ness 2 Electric Boogaloo
Kirby is a mood
JordanUnderneath was right all along...
Wow just wow welp Kirby is gonna get a life sentence
I can never look at Kirby the same anymore
Ahhhh, classic MatPat, destroying childhoods like always.

OG Game Theories are back! I'm so happy!
Chaotic Neutral
So is Kirby just a way worse version of the hulk? Cool!
I wonder where part 2 could be...
To be fair to Kirby, we are actually the horrible people forcing him to do this
Fool me once: I'm mad
Fool me twice: how could you?
Fool me three times: your officially that guy!
Did mattpatt make the theme song if not what is the song called?
And can be easily manipulated
It's been almost 2 weeks, where is part 2
sans is ness
Note: The bottom has Star Allies spoilers

I do understand the point of this theory and I don't disagree. However, there are a few things:
You misunderstand Adventure's plot. Yes, the removal of the star rod prevented Nightmare from appearing, but the removal of the Star Rod also caused dreams to disappear. Thus, Kirby saw this as a problem and fixed it. A breakdown in communication caused the plot to develop in the way it did; as far as Kirby was concerned, he was bringing dreams back to Dream Land. 

For Milky Way Wishes, what else are you going to do if your planet was threatened like that? Someone had a plan that Kirby decided to follow. Now truth be told, everyone should stop using the ancients to solve their problem, but he still did it to solve the problem. For Dyna Blade, he fought Dyna Blade to stop the damage she was causing Dream Land.

With impulsiveness, I'm surprised you're using Epic Yarn considering how Yin Yarn's invasion was only just rumors at that point (even King Dedede didn't realize until after it was too late, which you don't bring up), and when he got sucked into the yarn world, he immediately tried to fix the problems present. If you wanted to use a spinoff for this purpose, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse would have been a better choice, as it's implied his motivation was more of an apple. That entire part ignores Triple Deluxe, which he rescues King Dedede for no reason other than they're friends; Dream Land, which Kirby brings the food back because it's the right thing to do; Spring Breeze, which is the same as Dream Land; Planet Robobot, which Kirby is late to only because he was sleeping and he didn't realize that Haltmann's works was invading until after they already did; Kirby 64, which Ribbon convinces Kirby to save her planet; the ending of Heroes in Another Dimension, in which he willingly purifies all the antagonists for no reason other than he's a nice guy; and the main story for Star Allies, which (if I recall) also features Dedede stealing food (although this time it's because he's under Void Termina's influence)

Also, with Return to Dream Land, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Waddle Dee are shown to help out Magolor just as willingly. You really can't use that as a point against him and later talk about how King Dede and Meta Knight are both comparatively mature if they all did the same action.

Also, while you're right for the most part with Squeak Squad, Daroach was the one who planned on and eventually did let Dark Nebula out. Kirby didn't have much to do with unsealing him.

That said, Kirby is more "chaotic good" than "chaotic neutral" like suggested. It's true that he does cause quite a bit of chaos/destruction and resorts to violence first, but given his understanding of each situation, he was in the right.  If this theory is going where I think it is, then Kirby's not a reincarnation of Void Termina but more of an alternate version of him, just exposed to the energy of positive emotions (vs. Dark Matter's negative emotions). As such, by definition, even though he's naive and does resort to violence first, he's a good character. If only a bit chaotic (which makes sense considering void termina)
He‚Äôs like buu from dbz
12:26 That's why I love him
I want to know how squishy he is do a Theory on that
This is the only episode i refuse to believe lol
4:01
Would like to note that Kirby literally smacked Dedede in the face with a holy weapon to get him off.
ok so what did kirby do to you
Don't forget the Kirby is also referred to as the pink demon
Meteorz: Omae wa, mo shinderu...
Part 2 please
Umm, what happened to the second part? I've seen two more new GT episodes, but no Kirby. You said at the end of the video it would be up this week. Maybe Saturday?
When is the next part coming out?
I feel like you should check out what is Kirby Cannon. More specifically episode 20. It‚Äôs something that you might want to watch as it goes against this theory.  Rn I still think Kirby is good, but if you could find a way to change that, I‚Äôll be on your side. Also when are you doing part 2?
You have to remember that Kirby is a child, a very powerful child, who was never given any guidance in learning what to do and not to do he is learning all this on his own, maybe somebody should reach out and teach him so he would know better.
A good boy with a good series which would be ruined if someone testified: exists
Game Theory: A K C H U A L Y
Ummm.... Okay.
Mat, I've got one thing to say. A villain is a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot. Don't really think the small super powerful baby that has basic instincts would have evil actions. I mean, most children resort to violence for a lot of things.
12:28 Diddy‚Äôs KongQuest too.
Hey what about Kirby's mass attack? If I can recall correctly, Kirby was exploring dream Land when a powerful wizard split him into 9 or 10 pieces then he attempted to take over dream Land.
In Kirby's Dreamland 3, Kirby literally spends the whole game helping people so that he can save everyone from Zero...
None of this actually surprises me I remember the Deathbattle between Kirby and Majin Buu where they talk about how naive he is and strong he is but this really helps me bring it all together
Hey matpat, i am a huge fan of game thoery and film theory. But when is part 2 of your kirby theory gonna come out. I first got introduced to kirby in the anime form, and i want to see what this dark god that got reincarnated into kirby is, and your explination. 

In the anime, kirby is nightmares rouge creation, and king deedee is the one summoning nightmares monsters, so its great. Sorry, i went on a tanget, but i do want to see part 2.
Btw this is the 69th Nintendo theory
kirby is ingenuos, not bad
game makers: "he is a hero!"
everyone: " No!"
game makers: "but..."
everyone: throws thousands of theorys at the ground
game makers: " fine we will give him a gun"
everyone: * happines noice *
I think Kirby is just mindless. He's an idiot but he has good intentions.
Where part 2???? It's been so long
this is the worse theory I have seen but at lest Kirby solves the problems no offence mat pat but you do have a point :(
How strong is crash bandicoot's spin punch???
Do you still think he‚Äôs an amoeba, MatPat
Moral of the story, don‚Äôt touch Dedede‚Äôs stuff. If you opened his closet you‚Äôd probably get ambushed by Satan
In the show, all the toads were turned back... I'm the only who watched it... Are I not?
Uhh... Wouldn't the plot of squeek squad happen anyway, also, Kirby didn't unleashed that evil himself nor have anything to do with the unleashing...
2:23 ayeeee lol (look at star count)
Kirby: I‚Äôm a little pink ball who likes to eat
MatPat: GOD OF DESTRUCTION!!!
Ok, if it's gonna be this nitpicky then how about this? THE ENTIRE EVENTS OF STAR ALLIES IS LITERALLY KIRBY SAVING THE WORLD WITH KINDNESS AND THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP. That's not an exaggeration, that's how the Friend Hearts work! 

And overall, he's used friendship and kindness to save Popstar multiple times. Dreamland 3; the Love-Love Stick is made of the inhabitants happiness and gratitude. Dreamland 2; Kirby rescues the animal friends and they help him get the rainbow drops to form the Rainbow Sword. Kirby 64; Kirby helps Ribbon recover the crystal shards without hesitation! 
Kirby repeatedly has seen someone in trouble, and gone out of his way to help them. 

Kirby is a child, and as a child it's important for him to learn to take responsibility for his actions. Which he most certainly does! When Magolor turns evil, he could've just ignored Landia's request to stop him, but he teams up with the dragons right away. When Nightmare comes out he could've run away, but no, he follows Dedede's plan and battles! What about Sectonia? Dedede was captured and Kirby immediately set out to rescue him, and stop Sectonia from devouring all the life force on Popstar!
And the best example is the Three Mage Sisters from Star Allies! They aren't even grateful that Kirby saves them from avoid Termina, but he still goes out of the way to follow them into Another Dimension, purifies their corrupted minds, and even helps them get Hyness back to his normal self! 
Kirby, while sometimes being a cause of the problems getting worse (either always because of a lack of communication or something out of his hands) takes the necessary steps to fix the situation, even if it puts him in danger! He makes the best out of the negative situations he gets shoved into, and even if it hurts someone, will always have helping the home and friends he cares about.
Kirby best girl
Listen dude, I get that you're a theorist but like you literally just killed my childhood.
13:32 should have been a dio reference
You do know that Kirby‚Äôs a toddler it‚Äôs even confirmed
Edit: I know the anime is not canon but it says he a child in one of the game‚Äôs manual, the point is that he a child and most children hardly know what‚Äôs right or wrong and most of them are stubborn.
Mah-Shah-Tee!!
Part 2!?!?!?!?!
I can see why people didn't like the direction this video was headed. MatPat starts and ends the video saying that Kirby is a reincarnated god of destruction but spends the entire video explaining how Kirby is just a jerk. I liked the theory, I'm even ok with the cliff hanger since he made it clear from the beginning that this was a 2 part series, but for the entire video I was waiting to hear how Kirby is a god, but it never came. He started with " let me tell you a story all about how Kirby is a god", then said he was a jerk, THEN went to say "we'll cover how Kirby is a god in the next video". I believe it would have been better if he went with "he's a jerk, then, he's a god", instead of "he's a god, he's a jerk, he's a god". Would have given us a twist since we're coming into this video expecting to hear how Kirby's  evil and not at all about how he's a god of destruction.
1:49 that's not the hardest difficulty there's a difficulty that's secret that's after the soul melter difficulty its called "soul melter EX"
TFW someone calls call puyo a Candy crush a "gloried candy crush mod"

Puyo puyo: 1991
Candy Crush: 2012
He‚Äôs a a pink demon
So basically Kirby is DBZ buu but like a child.....kid.... kid buu ü§î
Thanks Sakuria
Mat pat please make a we happy few video thanks.
0:56
Kirby just inhaled a Scarfy.

But Kirby can‚Äôt inhale Scarfies...
Well, we now have a good reason to hate the FNAF theories. Because now the ending to this is delayed. Thanks Scott.
What about the anime?
That is why I main Kirby!
you know that YOU called HIM an amoeba, amoeba don't have morals, and are pretty stupid
Alright, so let's get to debunking.
->In Kirby's Adventure, Kirby goes hunting down the Star Rod pieces in an attempt to restore good dreams to dreamland. He has reason to believe due to his original title - Kirby's Dreamland - that Dedede would be the cause of trouble. I mean, Dedede took away the entire land's food supply, all for himself. After something as cruel as that, would you really put taking away all the good dreams below him? Kirby went out without much prior knowledge on the situation. All he knew was that Dedede destroyed the Star Rod. So he went out to fix it so Dreamland could have good dreams again. Dedede certainly didn't tell Kirby why he broke the rod before hand, so it's easy to assume here. And Kirby still defeated Nightmare.


->In Kirby Superstar/ Superstar Ultra, Kirby goes through Milkyway Wishes on a mission to stop the sun and moon from fighting. That would've been his wish. It's not Kirby's fault that Marx ended up betraying him after suggesting summoning Nova.


->Kirby Squeak Squad is the only relatively valid point you have here. But even then, Kirby just acts out of naivety.


->Kirby's Return to Dreamland. Magolor acts very amiable at the start, and Kirby is happy to help him rebuild his ship. Magolor lets Kirby do what he wants on board pretty much. And the fact that Landia basically attacks you right out the gate, the moment you approach Halacandra doesn't help their image. In this case, it was really easy for Kirby to be fooled.


->Kirby's avalanche is not canon.


That all being said, you were actually very close when you compared/called Kirby as Destroyer God. Kirby and Void Termina are shown to be irrefutably linked. But Kirby is a pure boy. He's of good intentions, and it's not his fault if he's manipulated.
So Kirby is a leftist, doesn't consider facts or the effects of his actions....
Kirby: *exists*
Mat-Pat: REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Mat Pat please give up! ùòöùò∞ ùòÆùò¢ùòØùò∫ of the statements made in this video are the players fault and not Kirby's. It is the players choice whether to kill every enemy on screen or to do a pacifist run! Not only that but those enemies are trying to kill Kirby regardless if they have something to do with the cake or not (7:39). It is safe to assume that King Dedede took Kirby's cake because he has been doing evil things for a long time just for the heck of it, He has even stole food from dreamland before so stealing Kirby's shortcake just to get a reaction is right up his alley (). Also innocent is not the word i'd use to describe things trying to kill you () (). Daroach is also the one who ends up opening the box so It's less of Kirby's fault then you think (). Who said that Kirby was going to do nothing when nightmare showed up? No one, Dedede just helped to help (). How was Kirby supposed to give chase to Magalore if he can't fly as fast as him? HE CAN'T, that's why he does nothing ()! Plus that's the narrator, text at the bottom of the screen stating facts possibly not even what Kirby's thinking ()! Now you're  assuming that Kirby isn't happy till his cakes back? Because his small sprite can't show emotions the only time he can show emotions is during the cutscene for all we know he was happy and the cake was a bonus  ()! Kirby was simply hungry! For all we know Kirby has NO IDEA people are being turned into yarn! him eating the metamato dosn't show that he cares about it more about it than saving the world! It is never even mentioned again! After he is educated about the mess he process to save dreamland and patchland ()! In the 20th anniversary handbook it explains they where experimenting a different personality for Kirby in a non cannon game (). What is Kirby (and Mario) supposed to do in those situations? He can't sit idly by while they kill him and AGAIN IT IS THE PLAYERS CHOICE to kill them or not (). THAT'S A FRICKEN SPIN OFF MINIGAME ()! That is just simply what awoke Kirby to stop him! AGAIN you are coming up with assumptions without Kirby even talking! He never says "I hate Dynablade because he woke me up" Thats just how he finds out ()! Next time i suggest making a theory that has SOLID evidence instead of pure speculation.
Next week we are going to see how undye from undertale is related to king de de dee
Kirby is very powerful and can destroy everything. His weakness lies within his innocence which villains use against him time and time again.

We must remember Kirby has saved the universe time and time again in almost every one of his games. Sometimes he makes mistakes but at the end of the day he is a hero even if he is a god of destruction.
Kirby in smash bros is a good toy
jesus christ guys its just a theory.
Okay, I have to make something clear. Yes, in some games, Kirby‚Äôs actions are very questionable, such as in Squeak Squad. But, he didn‚Äôt always cause problems. If Kirby hadn‚Äôt restored the Fountain of Dreams, then the citizens of Dream Land wouldn‚Äôt be able to dream. If Kirby hadn‚Äôt summoned Nova, the sun and moon would still fight. If Kirby didn‚Äôt chase after the squeak squad, they would‚Äôve opened the chest, summoning Dark Nebula Anyways.
And Landia wasn‚Äôt protecting the Master Crown, she had still causing problems.
And I know what you‚Äôre getting at in part 2, and it‚Äôs related to Star Allies and Void Soul. I won‚Äôt argue with that, but I‚Äôll mention one fatal flaw in your plan once you reveal the second part, as I‚Äôd have to explain what you‚Äôre going to explain anyways.
I just feel much smarter after watching these
Metakinght and Kirby are the same species and Kirby is a baby of that species
no kriby's an idot that's it
I really want to know the song at 0:37 its performance is lit
Kirby is a boy
Let me try to predict Game Theory's part 2, cuz I played my fair share of Kirby. By far the greatest 'God of destruction' (MatPat's words) hint is within Kirby Star Allies for the Switch. The final boss in that game, Void Termina, which is also called a god of destruction in-game, borrows several attack patterns and aesthetics from 0¬≤, the entity that controls and gathers Dark Matter with the goal to engulf the universe in darkness, but not just that. Judging by the gameplay design, Void Termina is the source of Dark Matter, and according to the Pause menu, Void exists across all dimensions, and, had it been born from positive, instead of negative emotions, things would've been different. It's written in a very suggestive way, like it's trying to tell you that you already know what the result of that "what-if" scenario actually looks like. Perhaps, it could be that Kirby is actually a Void that was born from positive energy, then?

I know I butchered the pause menus, where most of this stuff actually came from, and there's still several lore bits I haven't mentioned, but seriously, go look at a screenshot of Void Termina's 4th phase. The resemblance to Kirby is uncanny. Even it's voice is just Kirby's slowed down. This is probably what MatPat's going for for Part 2 (English pls)

Either that, oR ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE BUTTERFLY ALL ALONG. Seriously, butterflies have been in Kirby games since the very beginning, and the orange one that followed Kirby from Kirby Returns to Dreamland onwards absorbs Galacta Knight and transforms into Morpho Knight in Kirby Star Allies's alternate post-game story mode. You're probably wondering WTF NINTENDO, and yeah, I share that sentiment. That last one's a complete mystery.
Some rebuttals


1. Kirby's an infant, of course he wouldn't ask questions. His perception of the world is very black and white.
2. Magalor wasn't really a villain. He was corrupted by the power of the Master Crown. You know this from his appearances in Dream Collection and that one free game they released as an expansion of the side mode from Robobot.
3. If you look on Magalor's screen when he's saying "Hey, go become Dragonborn," it's showing a very clear reason why he should fight. Landia shot down the Starcutter. Magalor's lying does not mean Kirby's the villain.
4. Dedede has stolen ALL the food in Dream Land
5. The Halberd is a war machine.
Kirby animated series
I don‚Äôt like Kirby anymore.
Were is next episode
Isn't Kirby essentially a small child.
Big kirby don't know anything
I just wonder who'd win a fight between Kirby and Shaggy
Kirby is hero
kirby has no brain
he looks at the monster he freed like it is nothing because he can't understand what are they
I feel like we haven‚Äôt had a Game Theory in forever, but it‚Äôs only been two weeks
When's part 2?
i mean kirby cannon zero/darmatter/voidTermina are the same person and is kirby metaknight and galactaKnight's race corrupted by i guess negative energy Darkstar or jambaHeart's? when reborn after being killed 2 time's zero is born evil again by absorbing all the evil from the galaxy and all the negative thought's and feeling in hyness controlled his actions
I miss this old style
Now I see dedede‚Äôs point.
Isn‚Äôt Kirby a toddler?  Wouldn‚Äôt that explain his lack of forethought and assumptions against Dedede?
There is one fnaf game you forgot
I feel like Kirby isn‚Äôt a force for evil or a force for good; I feel like Kirby is not free-thinking, but a naive, gullible alien.
WHERE‚ÄôS PART 2 MAT? HUH?
Kirby... he's just Beerus, or fat Buu.
1) Kirby isn't the smartest.
2) Many Video games characters can be murderers, but it's really the player who makes the choices.
3) Squeak Squad is just ... something else.
Okay let‚Äôs have fun playing pacifist. I‚Äôll quit when I get to the first boss.
king dedede isn't a hero, he steel food
Game theory: Dedede is a hero
16:24 ITS BEEN A WEEK MATPAT
I think most forget he‚Äôs actually a baby... and it is confirmed that he‚Äôs a baby star warrior. So clearly a baby ain‚Äôt going to have much if any understanding on what they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôll just do what they think is right and sometimes that isn‚Äôt actually a good thing. Like yeah he causes problems but he fixes them when told like a child would. 
That tiny bit of information which actually, when you step back, makes sense for why he‚Äôs a certain way
So much funny screenshots XD
Man amoeba are dangers
Kirby=majin  buu
But kirbys only a baby...he dosent know any betterüòí
He's a baby, give him some slack

This is a joke. Remember that
that gets me thinkin, were dharkon and galeem the secret protags of WoL? Here me out they were only capturing the fighters and making spirits and maybe the spirits WANTED to control a stronger body. The fighters could have been getting spa treatment for all we know. Maybe there was a coming force that would give the nintendoverse a much harsher end. Kind of a stretch but still a viable theory.
Go metaknight and king
Chef kawasaki
Hey Matpat, WHERE‚ÄôS PART 2?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Kirby didn't open the chest with Dark nebula, Daroach opened it
Soo fortnite pt 2???
0:56 Kirby can‚Äôt suck in the orange guys tho
That was studpi
Dude he‚Äôs a star warrior, watch the show and all the answers are right thier he‚Äôs no villain he‚Äôs like Mehta night on the same team
Death stares for an uncomfortably long amount of time

Poyo
Kirby is just a baby though. Meta Knight is of the same race as Kirby, but Meta Knight has matured.

Edit: Furthermore, Even in "Kirby: Right Back at Ya!", Kirby rarely does anything without instruction. You can that in nearly every episode Kirby is instructed to "suck it up" usually by Tiff. Kirby simply cannot think for himself for the grand majority of the time, much like a baby. Any creature that has ever existed can only act out what it has been taught or exposed to. Who the first teacher was, however, may never be known.
Kirby...wouldn't it be easier just to go to the store and buy a new cake?
No? You HAVE to have this one? Well alright, but can you try to not destroy everythi-



....Ok, well can you at least not unleash anything evil this time?





ALRIGHT!! Now can you go fix your mess?!


.......


 KILL IT OR SOMETHING, FOR GOD'S SAKE!
Isn't King Dedede the villain in the anime? And also, Kirby is a baby.
I have 3 points of interest: 1. Most of the enemies in the Kirby games serve the bad guy, or just try to hurt you either. 2. Squeak squad was directed by another company, not Hal. Even then, meta Knight doesn't  explain his motives in squak squad  3. Kirby promptly solves almost all the problems. P.S. when he sees that dyna blade had babies, he promptly feels bad and raises her children, even teaching them how to fly.
"Kirby is so cute thought"
                        -Za Whole World
I freakin love epic yarn
Soooo Kirb‚Äôs basically a mercenary
CAKE!!!
kirby is just a baby he doesnt know what hes doing
This is why your legendary hero shouldn't be 200 years underaged
Beerus the Destroyer who
Oh yea then what is the theory of Kirby planet robobot
2:45 so kirby is beerus.
Well in the one of the latest Kirby games Kirby makes friends with his or her enemies
Kirby isn‚Äôt bad.
Kirby is just s t o o p i d and doesn‚Äôt think.





ave maria
Still waiting for part 2
Would love to see what's it like to get sucked up and eaten by Kirby but let's not forget Yoshi can also do this but with his tongue when he eats Goomba's
HE IS JUST A BABY!
Hey, I've got a good Horror game for you to play and make some theories about. Go to Roblox, search "RedTar_Entertainment" in players, then go to "creations" and go to "Monster School." Soon, I will post a site about the game and its characters.
I have a few problems with this that I want to clarify... (this isn't meant as hate, Matpat, I love your stuff, but this one doesn't fit in)

First off, as a general rule, Kirby has (almost) always attacked in self-defense. If you walk next to any enemy, I can assure you you will be attacked, with the exception of Scarfys. Evidence? Well, if kirby would attack anything he saw, why didn't he attack magolor the first time? Ribbon? These are just examples. Matpat also mentions Kirby watching the halberd go down. Meta Knight was raging a war on dreamland, and Kirby is defending his territory. He didn't go out of his way to destroy some airship just because he could, he acted in self defense of his peaceful home. Dyna Blade? Kirby obviously doesn't understand what's going on, and likely followed the bird out of curiosity, where enemies got in the way, which again, he fought in self defense. Once reaching Dyna Blade, Dyna Blade seems to attack first, however, it does seem Dyna Blade could have been acting in defense as well, seeing she had offspring nearby. That doesn't mean kirby went out of his way to attack Dyna Blade, either. Even AFTER Dyna Blade was defeated, Kirby still saw the offspring without a mother, and took care of them until Dyna Blade was well, returning to take possession. Kirby didn't attack these birds after they saw he meant no harm, did he? Kirby's DreamLand 3? I can't remember any foes that you would consider as Kirby's 'friends', and again, he acted in self defense quite obviously. After defeating a boss (after collecting all the heart stars in that area) the boss will be freed from Dark Matter's possession, and when you return, they treat you quite kindly. If kirby wasn't fighting in self defense, then why did he notattack them after they were freed? Why not? Kirby literally follows where he thinks will bring him where he wants to go, and will fight back if a threat appears.

Although I admit, Kirby Squeak Squad had questionable motives on Kirby's part, but once again, he is a child. An infant. He doesn't understand anything quite yet, and in general, doesn't understand what may be wrong with what he's doing. Meta Knight realizes this, when he fights Kirby in Kirby's Adventure (or Nightmare in Dreamland), where Meta Knight gives kirby power-ups and throws enemies at him, showing questionable motives that can most likely be answered by him trying to train kirby, but still assisting him. Heck, he even gives Kirby a sword before they fight for an even match! Milky Way Wishes? Yes, he is invading, but if Kirby could take the piece peacefully and leave, he would do so. He is quite literally attacked, and fought back, again, in self defense, and even in the bosses, you can't tell me that they're not attacking Kirby. Again, self defense. 

Later, Matpat also mentions Kirby, after saving Dreamland's food, starts to eat as much as possible,  but I doubt that Gourmet Race was even canon. At the chance it was, DeDeDe literally engaged that sequence, as he challenged Kirby atop a cliffside, and of course Kirby accepted. Kirby is a child, not understanding the downside of this challenge.

In general, Kirby quite literally didn't mean most of this. And saying his only goal is destruction actually  stretching it. If he had thirst for blood, he would have destroyed popstar by now, considering from Megaton Punch, he most certainly has the power to do so.

(Also I don't mean this as hate, Mat. Love your work, keep it up, sorry for that million dollar loss a while back, and thanks for amazing content. I write this only to show Kirby's true nature, seeing as I don't want however many people coming up to me trying to convince me kirby is insane because of the video)
The John wick of Nintendo
wait where's my second part m8
Wheres part 2?
The cake is a lie
Matpat: Kirby is a 8 inch ameiba
ALSO Matpat: Kirby is a God who's purpose is desctruction

  Jesus Matpat decide already
By the way, isn't it kinda funny how Kirby is the only one to escape in the beginning of Smash 5?
We still getting a part 2 to this?
When is he going to start hakaing everyone
Sorry man, somebody named Meteorz had to beat you up about this. I hope it didn't hurt that much.
A GameTheory without a punny intro BEFORE the theme? I must be in the infinite void that is Kirby.
For a guy who barely socilizes you leave really long comments in videos
11:38 Hahaha. Brawl renders
If your cake got stolen with a chest, wouldn't you think it would be in the chest?
it is more of a puyo puyo mod
Technically with Squeak Squad, Kirby didn‚Äôt unleash the evil that time.
Plz don't ruin Kirby for meeeeeeee
Nice! You ruined my childhood...
Kirby didn‚Äôt know that marx and magolor would want to take over popstar so I wouldn‚Äôt call  Kirby a monster
When part 2???
Tries to show examples of Kirby being called a hero, uses Magolor's text 
Oh no.
Hell no wonder Kirby was the only one who survived World Of Light, he summoned Galeem himself
When part 2 Come???
Kirby is mental
Marx caused every thing but kirby did not elimenate every libing creature on the 7 planets also the bosses were not killed. In kirbys epic yarn he fought yin yarn because of the prince(forgote his name) told him what yin yarn did. In the revenge of meta knight all the ship memebers escaped it even state it in the game. In the gourment race dedede challenge him to a race while trying to eat as much food as posible. At the end of dyna blade kirby helps rase dyna blades chick. Dyna blade acted threatingly first. Plus mat pat look for every thing that happens in the game you did not state the members on the halberd escaped nither that they tried to kill him
I would still trust Kirby with my social security number tho
It‚Äôs been a week and no part 2
So Kirby is an anti-hero like Deadpool
All 4 of don't you got me them you got me but Kobe on water whatever is nothing saying that the only reason why he's fighting it's for the magical tomato I even playing the game not right now though but I have played it in those no sign that the only reason why fighting is for the tomato so like you said fool me once that's fine by be fool me twice shame on you fool me three times it's getting old fool me 4 times wow you're just a copier lie to me five times wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè woooooooooow
Sequel?
You must be the lowest of the low to annoy the nicest fan base of all time
Mat pat  kirby most likely get a SOCK of fear and Kirby is most likely mad at king ddd.
Honestly I liked this theory. Long ago in like early 2000 I had this same I idea except it was a little different because I thought Kirby was evil lmao. I mean he absorbs people and kills them upon absorbing them all while they are conscious and aware. Especially the waddle dees. They have it the worst because they don‚Äôt even have powers for him to steal. So whenever you gulp a waddle nothing happens and they literally just vanish into the empty pit that‚Äôs Kirby. Also in sqeak squad I find it unique that you get a look in kirbies stomach and if you eat a powerless enemy they actually turn into a star and literally explode out of existence in kirbies stomach. Dark
LIE!!!!
So... no part 2 on this?????
Give me the real kirby lore channel "game theory "
I said the REAL kirby lore channel "woolie vs"
Perfect
where dat part dos
You should do the zepeto theory! Plzzz
Where is pt2 D:
you now think after this video,kirby evil and doesn't care what he is killing. that's true. but keep in mind that kirby doesn't have a big brain. and its true that if you are a "hero" (like kirby) you have a ton of stres and you take risks.that dededebroke the starrod for saving the planet, but "braking" stuf doesn't sound good.that kirby was attacking,is because he broke the starrod.and kirby didn't know that nightmare was a thing. and if dedede said:kirby, that's dangerous don't do that, nightmare  wil popup. kirby didn't sommen nightmare. if al good guys kirby kills said: hey kirby, there is a bad guy in the box help me defend. or: kirby, you are helping a bad guy, can you help me. he woud help the good guys. kirby is good that's what i explained.
i hope you agree and if agree like my comment.
Kirby should just clap the entire DBZ universe just to flex
Thats cruel
I want part two
Dude he's just a pink ball who eats stuff this still is really funny tho made my day
Kirby is still a baby ya know
At the beggining, Kirby eats a scarfy, BUT HE CAN'T EAT SCARFY'S
I was to busy thinking about how hard nightmare was
11:11. Was that a D and D reference!?!
5:24 derpy kirby
Let's be honest, even ignore those event, I don't think that Kirby is the guy can be trust, at least Kirby eating everything and anything that is existing, that's doesn't seems good.
Game Theory: Kirby...Dream Land's Biggest THREAT!


Me: Kirby's Calling The Police!
i thought kirby was just a baby with no idea what the heck he is doing
Kirby killed a mother bird... yeah,but after that,kirby sees the kids and helps them to learn to fly,and gives them food.
Uh bandana Dee is Kirby's friend
sonic for hire was right
Well, here‚Äôs the thing... Kirby is literally a baby.
Plot twist kirby is ddlc
Did you really need a theory to prove that Kirby is extremely dangerous to everyone around him?
Matt Pat, you ok?
Reminds me of Goku's selfishness
Kirby is not evil because he is only being controlled by real people so the real villain is mankind 

mic drop

Edit:omg I never got this many likes before thanks,
Btw it‚Äôs just a joke
Reminds me of the EGad story
Kirby had reason to think dedede was behind stealing his cake (from the FIRST GAME), and neither him or meta knight stop to explain to Kirby what‚Äôs going on, looking really shifty instead.
No intro joke.
5:15 when you fartin but you crap
Matpat turn on your location I just want to talk
As a Kirby main, I‚Äôm sad
Kirby is a cycopath
Mooore
Mat pat what about the other games like kirby star allies
Yes, Kirby may have been mistaken and beat up Dyna Blade.
BUT if you had paid attention to the rest of the scene, you'd have noticed that he realized his mistake and took care of the young ones while Dyna Blade recovered.

Continuing on, in Revenge of Meta Knight, Dyna Blade actually HELPS YOU to get back to the Halberd (even if she does get shot down in the end, again). She did that to say thank you to Kirby, why else would she do it?

Also, the fact that you take Kirby's Avalanche as canon is surprising. In literally any other game (besides Epic Yarn) Kirby only speaks in his 'poyo' language.  How would he go from that to full English just for one game? If he did actually learn English, don't you think that he would've been speaking that since Avalanche? No, he still speaks in 'poyo' language.

Adding on, I'm pretty sure that they've mentioned this in the games too, but Kirby is just a CHILD. He's still learning about the world and doesn't understand everything. We all made mistakes when we were kids, even if we didn't put the entire world at stake multiple times, but you get my point.

Kirby is the sort of hero that forgives people for their actions. Hell, some of his old enemies are now dream friends (Marx, Magalor, etc.). 

I might have gotten some things wrong when typing this out, but yeah, I feel like most of the comments you're going to get aren't exactly going to be positive. 
Hopefully Part 2 is going to change that.
Where is part 2?
Where Is part 2?
Pls do part 2
he just like Deadpool
7:00  A Villan Taking Over Innocent Kirby, HMMMM
matpats got that cake
Universe21
Kirby is a ahole
BLACK HOLE RUUUUUUN!
Why did I just got a Mario is Evil flash back?
What about his role in the new super smash bros ultimet
I SWEAR THIS VIDEO BETTER NOT BE LIKE THE MARIO IS A PSYCHOPATH ONE... I still can't play Mario in games without feeling some disgust...
ok so basically kirb is baby
Kirby is a baby
so hes literally majin buu?
In Epic Yarn Kirby just found food which no one stole. Also he tried to Stop Yin Yarn because he Turned his Planet into Yarn. Also it would make no sense for Kirby to want to Defeat Yin Yarn because he wanted to eat a Tomato seeing how Kirby already ate that Tomato.
Wasn't he descended from a race of star warriors that effectively kept the galaxy safe? The most powerful one at that, but all in all just a child? So going with this he doesn't come from a race of destroyer gods or what not, but is just a child with god like power with no understanding of what he's doing or the consequences there of. Does that make any sense to those reading this?
Ooooo part 2! I can‚Äôt waitüò©üòÉ
I disagree with this video. Kirby isn‚Äôt a god. He‚Äôs a demonic villain who deserves to be klobahed by our King, Lord, Savior, and God the omnipotent Dedede. All hail the King God Dedede, Klobarer of Dat Der Kirby. All hail the King God Dedede, Savior of Dreamland. All hail the King God Dedede, Supreme Overlord of the Universe.
‚ÄúKirby is a reborn god of destruction...‚Äù

So, a child barely capable of speech and can easily be taken advantage of is evil. I mean, maybe
Ododododododododooeodododododododododo
MatPat did an oopsie
hes like the main character from one punch man(forgot his name) he wont do anything unless it involves him in anyway. selfish right?
Where is this said Part 2?
I mean... Kirby is literally Void Terminally creates with good emotions.
KIRBY  IS  BAD!
So... The  next one
I think in some ways that Kirby's actions are him trying to do good, but they don't end up being that way all the time. Yeah, in Squeak Squad cake was his prime motivation and other similar things to it, such as Dyna Blade. But he probably does these things with the best intention. Kirby is a bit naive though, as seen with him trusting in Marx and Magolor, and releasing Nightmare, but again, it's seen as them pointing Kirby towards a good direction. An even better example of Kirby TRYING to do good is in Kirby 64. In which Kirby is willing to help the fairy Ribbon in restoring the Crystal to it's former glory when beginning to play the game. I most definitely agree that Kirby is pretty chaotic a lot of the time, but even so, he's trying to do what he believes is good.
i think because kirby is a kid
This video got suggested literally right after I watched: attempting to explain all of Kirby lore in one video.
I hate Kirby now.
On top of that the boy can't even talk and I don't see anyone teaching him how to even talk.
Is he possibly a sociapath?
Wheres part 2
Wow... This... This is really bad.

"No evidence that it was the king"

Ya know, despite the fact that you completely ignore the fact that King Dedede was the cause of the issues in the first game - Stealing food and Sparkling Stars, the latter being something that the Dream Landers need in order to play and work.

You say there's no evidence, but there's past actions.

Also, way to ignore the fact that Dedede was swimming in the Dream Fountain, pretty much being disrespectful to the monument.
Kirby is a baby
Look kirby is just not that smart and easy usable so he good just not smart
Better than mario at least
MatPats comment is a part of a Game Theory script and will take an hour to read
Me: Is Kirby a hero?
MatPat: Well yes, but actually, no.
Kirby is a very young kid though...
Question one answered Kirby is like a baby he doesn‚Äôt know better
This is a bunch of crap lol
Didn‚Äôt you say you were going to do prt 2 the week after this
they say that kirby is evil...
they also say he is smart...




he is really not, i mean what did you expect, he's a single celled organism.
His behavior makes sense since he is an infant, but he is still super dangerous. His petty behavior though makes him even more scary.
Anyone else waiting for part two
Now here‚Äôs a theory. What if the citizens of dreamland like dedede and Marx and meta knight all know Kirby will put it all together too late and they want him to finish the job so they can put the blame on him and or so they can do something bigger
Gpeg Zola
I think Kirby is more of a naive kid, rather than an active villain or weapon. He is told what to do and determinedly follows those commands. I say he is more naive than a "machine" because the games are very clear that he is a very young form of some sort of powerful creature. However, the way he form relationships with some characters and even "learns" (somewhat) from his mistakes.
Matpat, Stahp pls
That hurts
I honestly think that Kirby was designed this way. To be a cute little monster. As a matter of fact, Kirby‚Äôs name was given because the harshness of the name heavily contradicts the cute character we see. The story structure also matches the idea of kirbyism (which you briefly mentioned, easier for beginner players like children and harder for adults). It‚Äôs cute for children but gets brutal later on and when analyzed more deeply.
More!
About the Magolor thing,you‚Äôre wrong,here‚Äôs why... 


Magolor built trust with Kirby since he crash landed there,he grew a connection and Kirby trusted him, that is why he defeated the three headed dragon he separated to then use to defeat him,the real villain all along. Basically one of the points of the game is to be careful who you trust,personally I trust no one and Kirby in this occasion was backstabbed,he didn‚Äôt go there like a mindless freak.
He‚Äôs also an amoeba
Then why does Kirby go trough all the way to saving his friends?
 in Smash ultimate?
I LITERALLY KEEP SQUEAK SQUAD ON MY BEDSIDE DRESSER WTF
where is the other one
Kirby triple deluxe he saves Dedede  out of the goodness of his heart
Its not that deep
hah i have a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù named kirby and we‚Äôre not friends anymore bc i couldn‚Äôt trust her hahah
Kirby is a assassin
Pt 2 when?
POYO
Ye i don't trust anything that looks like a gumball
Kirby:oh look a tomato kirby eats the tomato and goes on a journey to help prince fluff 
Game theory: ThIs WhOlE JoUrNeY iS fOr A ToMaTo
But kirby is just a child and he does not know not to trust stranger
Who would win in a battle
one punch man v Kirby
he put out some valid points but i have no trouble not beliveing this gonna wait till part two if i think it makes sense then gonna delete this
0:21 but the cake is a lie
Game Theory: Kirby isn't a Hero, his just somebody who decides to help people and defeat evil to make the world a safer place.
Me: Isnt that a hero?
This is why Kirby should be banned from Super Smash Bros. HE IS A GOD OF DESTRUCTION!
Please finish this theory
I thouht he was pokemon
Part 2
Who would win?
God of Destruction Kirby vs Ultra Instinct Meta Knight
I thought he was an amoeba
we're not doing the mario thing again
You just got wronged by someone 
(I won't say who because you sorta can't stand criticism so...)
whens part 2
You got to rember Kirby is only a child
15:40 That's for being selfish
Welp, that must be why Kirby is so good in smash...
Do a theory on castle crashers
I just think Kirby is kinda dumb.....
More!
He's Dio.
It‚Äôs canon that the Halberd‚Äôs crew escaped when the ship was going down, Captain Vul mentioned it more than once during the dialog...
And it was Daroach who released Dark Nebula, not Kirby.
Recently a small kirby channel by the name of Meteorz posted a video called What is Kirby Canon detailing and debunking facts stated in your video. Watching it proves things that are false in your video. I an a literal no one but this opinion from meteorz should still be noticed.
He's just a babie!!!
Kirby vs Kratos.
14:57 "DEAL WITH IT M9"
Kirby: I will eat mat Pat
How Kirby sounds: Poyo Poyo!
Forget what tier lists say. I'm pretty sure Kirby is the strongest character in Smash Bros. At least in terms of sheer power.
Candy Crush Mod?????
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Where is the second part?
Where‚Äôs part 2? Can‚Äôt wait for it
But what about Kirby Star Allies where Kirby has the choice to make friends does this show a Kirby after he has matured
HES A BABY
7:11
And doesn't really care
So yeah he might be a demon but still he is a kid also he's a hero saves the day yeah!
Kirby's Epic Yarn: Anyone remember that game? 
Literally the only Kirby game I've played...
okay can you make an "us" theory but like make it not scary and explain what happens with spoilers cause i know I'll never have the guys to see it
thanks
We had return to dream land MAGOLORS BOSS FIGHT IS HARD WE HAD TO DO IT FIVE TIMES
Part 2 coming in 2 years. Dr who all over again
Also, people wonder why Dedede is the king of dream land. Because he protects and leads it justly
Heya love this theory!! I was wondering if you could do a theory on Yandere Simulator?
and here i thought it was a little silly when Death Battle pitted Kirby against Majin Buu XDDDDD
WHEN ARE U GOING TO MAKE PART 2????
i wonder if this theory will push to the point where it touches smash bros :P
Guess u did not watch kirby right back atcha
Here he is! He‚Äôs the puffball we call Kirby and Dreamland‚Äôs the place he defends! He‚Äôs so cute! Ain‚Äôt he cute? But he gets a little burpy because he devours all his friends. (He‚Äôs got an eating problem.)
-Brentalfloss
Kirby would betray all of dreamland for a big enough slice of cake.
THE CAKE IS A LIE
You‚Äôre so rude to Kirby
Kirby is actually a baby, of course he dont now what he does
This actually aggravates me
god damn Kirby is evil
On a followup is something idk if people talked about but, it has been shown, unless i actually missed something, that Kirby can't talk in the games, just make cute noises. So how would Kirby even question the people he fights if he can't even question? someone do tell me if i'm wrong and he can talk
69 STARS
Sans is Ness, Link is dead, Peach is also dead, Mario is a sociopathic communist, Toad is evil, Inklings are squids and now Kirby is an ameba, who is actually a reincarnated god of destruction. Ah, Nintendo we all love you so much. I now wonder is professor Oak a cunning, manipultive puppetmaster ;).
Since Mario had been declared a sociopath, link has been found out to be dead and kirby is just a literal god of destruction, is the next step that donkey kong is a drug user?(his bananas being the drugs)
Game Creators: Finally this game will be famous

MatPat: *Explained

Game Creators: I wish MatPat‚Äôs video get demonetized
"Mercy?? You expect mercy from me!?  I'M CHAOTIC NEUTRAL!!!"
Intended game story:
Mat pat: well yes, but actually no
Kirby's a God of Destruction? That explains how he beat Majin Buu in a death battleü§£
Oh THE THING by jhon carpenter

Well i will wait 4 a theory 4 that
Kirby sucks get it!?! 
He's bad 
He sucks (aaaaaaaa!!!!!tasty! I WANT MORE AAAAAAAAA!)
Kirby (Nintendo) vs Kirby (Comicbook Artist/creator)
Your kinda right,in star allies  the final  boss is a ball of energy  named void,and that boss has the same  face kirby has and the same voice
This is like the first kirby video I watched until the end... (i still watch those other kirby vids but didn't finished them)
I think I should burn my favorite Kirby dress üò¢
Sonic for hire made me think Kirby was bad many years ago.
even sakuri said it. in smb ultimite in the boxing ring in the background when u play as kirby it will say the pink demon
WHERE IS THE PART 2 DEAR GOD I NEEEEEED 2 KNOOOOOOOOOW
The background music is making it intense
Lol üòÇ hahhahhahhahhahha




Water üòÇ
So... Kirby's a weapon?
He doesn't know what he's doing tho
He's too youny to know
So he the Beerus of DragonBall
I remember night mare from kirby right back at ya
Hey I'm not THAT scary...
But thanks for mentioning me.
Could Kirby Be Related To Void Termina From Star Allies?
Calling it now

Kirby's a Dark Matter
Is nobody going to talk about how this kirby video was posted on MAR10 day.
chaotic neutral... yeah, I agree.
Star warrior...pssshhh more like star killerüëΩüòà
idk. about the god thing, but chaotic neutral, sure.
so are kirby and dragon ball connected if he's a god of destruction reborn
Kirby can't be that scary. I mean, is he not usually near those bottom tiers in most smash tier lists?
if you always smile, acting cute, while killing everyone - I don't need a game theory to know he's a psychopath.
Basically, He's Majin Buu.
matpat what have you done kirby is now coming for you run!!!!!!!!
I swear to god Matpat I messaged you years ago saying I had a theory Kirby is a black hole and you're only now realizing
Do another part and continue
I was raging on super smash bros cause of him
kirby voice cute Hi!
KIRBY EVIL nooooo!!! JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
Kirby is a good guy
Hakaishin Kirby
Look Pretty there 0:38
Sakurai is gonna see this and force you to delete this video fro trash talking his precious baby.
Theres bean an update on the scottgames.com In the elements 'Remember Jeremy' it says can you explain it?



Like so Matt can see this
Didn't he already release this video a couple of times?...

Or just rehashing old content?
Is Kirby a Analogy of Outrage Culture before it was a thing?
Is Kirby a reincarnated God of Destruction?
Looks at Magalor Soul. Looks back at Kirby
Looks at Void Soul. Looks back at Kirby


HMMMMM...




Spoilers
I also feel the "Kirby is just a baby" argument plays even more into this being a possibility. I mean when you defeat Magalor he straight up dies (given that they show you his lifeless body that disintegrates as soon as the crown breaks.) and the crown grows sentience using his body as a vessel. When Magalor Soul is created what is the first thing it does? Smiles and starts creating life out of nothing. Even the animation for its enemy spawning move has it more interested in what it's making than the people trying to fight it. It's practically playing around as it fights Kirby and the others. 


Void Souls is the same thing. Look at its expressions as it fights you. Even when it first appears it looks confused as if it was just birthed into existence and is playing around with its powers. And honestly I don't think giving them striking resemblances to Kirby even in how he expresses himself just for shits and giggles. I think they want show that Kirby is related to some of these creatures, with the difference being he's more aligned with the side of good than evil. Would explain how he can fight them man to man and wield God like weapons with ease. 


I wouldn't be surprise if at one point he inhaled one of the God like villains he fought and gained their powers (make that happen next game Nintendo).
Wuuuuuut no intro this time just straight to the theory? :(
YOUR RUINING MY CHILDHOOD STOOOOOOOOOOOP
Kirby‚Äôs a whole mood
Heheheheheh, dark and twisted on the inside. Just like me
So.. Kirby is an anti-hero. He doesn't care whether he almost destroyed the world, he only just saves it only for his own intentions. Also he might be like, a toddler with ultimate powers (aka JackJack from Disneys Incredibles)
sometimes innocent more dangerous than evil itself
Kirby seems more like a naive, innocent child that bad people take advantage of and lacks the proper reasoning skills to stop and ask important questions.

Most young children want to help people that are in trouble or ask them for help which is why RL bad guys exploit that part of them to hurt them and adults have to teach young children that there are bad people that will hurt them so they need to be careful; my Mom was terrified that my older sister Renee (not her real name) would be abducted because at the time she was blonde haired and blue eyed and had a habit of not staying close while out shopping but she did worry about ALL of us when we wandered off in the store.

And in his defense thinking King Dedede was responsible for his missing cake the King had taken food in the past for a feast and being a small child he‚Äôs not going to ask who else could have taken his cake and just go after who he thinks is responsible.

Some blame can rest on the adults since they don‚Äôt tell him why the Star Rod was broken apart or ask why he wants to open ‚ÄòPandora‚Äôs Box‚Äô.
I mean, if you look at this of him as a baby (like the anime dub), these things are a bit more acceptable. Helping out any evil isn't a thing he'd really think about first. I mean, if a baby wants food or sleep, then they're gonna get it, one way or another.
They give him the title of 'pink demon' in smash ultimate in the boxing stage
In nightmare in Dreamland it clearly says that king dedede surely didn't mean any harm and that he was guarding the star rod from the TRUE enemy nightmare and Kirby King dedede's power to defeat nightmare so yeah Kirby is a whole asshole
BUT KERRBEYY
Kirby is canonically a baby or toddler.
Soon.... Kirby is Gunter?
Kirby the glutton.
I would also destroy someone if they took my cake
Well, he did beat up a FREAKING DEMON LORD THAT DESTROYS WORLDS.
Thanos is next.
excitedly waiting for next week

"Huh? This was released a week ago?"

*it's now been three weeks and no new theory,I can be patient...
:( I can...but I'm too excited for this new theory!!*
Kirby is Actually a reincarnation of Big Smoke
Weeeeeeell Kirby is one of the most if not the most powerful character in smash ultimate
TACTICAL KIRBY INCOMING red code sirens activate
I mean what do you expect from a Vacuum sucking gumball named kirby
Of course its brain is sized as a peanut.
Kirby‚Äôs not evil in the first two, he didn‚Äôt know
Kirby is void
You are lying about kirby!!!!!!!!
If the todes are bricks what are the mushrooms that come from the bricks
Kirby Just a little boy how is he supposed to know that he‚Äôs making the problems!
Planet Robobot and Star Allies kinda proves Kirby has drive.
You know, the Kirby enemies kill Kirby ON THE TOUCH
Kirby is actually a baby ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
If Kirby is a God of destruction, what universe is he in?
This Kirby lore is wrong
Kirby's Avalanche isn't canon. It's just a Puyo Puyo reskin, and so is the dialogue.
You used the wrong boxart for Star Allies and Super Star Ultra.
Kirby unleashed Nightmare because he didn't know it existed. He thought he was doing the right thing. And Kirby isn't the one who opened the chest that had Dark Nebula, Daroach is. Have you actually watched the cutscene?
If killing enemies makes you a villain, almost every video game protagonist is a villain.
When you're talking about Super Star Ultra, you're showing footage from the original Super Star.
How is getting tricked by Marx and Magolor bad? He didn't know what they really wanted.
There's also the fact that Kirby is a baby who doesn't understand a lot of the things that you're saying make him a villain.
You ignored so much stuff from the series just to make your theory look right. Put the reasons that he  a hero in Part 2.
With the case of Kirby's Dreamland, he had no idea that the star rod held back Nightmare's Power, and up until Nightmare was released, Kirby assumed that King Dedede was just being a jerk or something.
With the case of Milky Way Wishes, he would've been able to get his ultimately good wish over to Nova, if it wasn't for Marx coming in at the last second.
With the case of Dynablade, she was destroying all of the crops in dreamland, and so it seems that those chicks were a small sacrifice to the entirety of Dedede's kingdom starving to death.
With the case of Metaknight's Revenge, he was basically attempting to take over the entirety of Dreamland in a military coup, and so Kirby went on and stopped him.
With the case of Kirby's Return to Dreamland, it was rather heavily implied that Landia was responsible for destroying Magalor's ship, which up until the end, Kirby considered that as a malicious act from Landia.
With the case of Kirby Squeak Squad, Kirby was in no way responsible for the theft, nor the opening of the chest which King Dedede was protecting.

Is Kirby naive? He certainly is! Perhaps a bit close-minded? The games seem to imply that a handful of times anyways. With that in mind, Kirby is in no way a "chaotic super weapon" or whatever you're trying to claim. Kirby has been explicitly described as essentially a young child, being from the race known as the Star Warriors, which includes Metaknight. With Kirby being a child, it certainly explains the character flaws that you mentioned in the video, with him being both rather manipulable, being rather lacking on the side of reason and rational solutions, as well as him being a bit on the idiotic side at times. Despite what flaws he has shown throughout his adventures, he's still trying to be a force for good throughout the universe, and it's honestly disappointing that you'd call him "The Villain of Dream Land" for simply not being a perfect character. Apart from your Sans is Ness video from way back when, this is probably the worst case of your desperate clickbaiting attempts yet.
Here‚Äôs a thought. What if Kirby had NO IDEA he was summoning the evils, and was just saving Popstar out of the goodness of his Puffiness?
Fool me once, shame on you;
Fool me twice, shame on me;
Fool me three times, it's getting repetitive;
Fool me four times; and, well maybe the series just needs to spice up its general plot structor...

~MatPat 2019
In Link's Awakening, Kirbys are invincible enemies. But Wart exists as a non-threatening NPC, so it's just possible Link is the bad actor in that game, what with the eventual destruction of the universe and all
Loved the austin powers reference
Loved the austin powers reference
the tv show shows that kirby was made for destruction
10:18 ‚ÄúWeapon of Mass Consumption‚Äù**
AntDude won't approve xD.
I agree with you matpat but what about in the shoe dedede is a villain buying monsters from nightmare interprizes to kill Kirby shouldn't the king be accountable too ?
Tootsie pop nice one üòÇüòÇ
What's this? A theorist video that doesn't start with a skit before the intro rolls? Honestly, this is good. Go back to this
Kirby is a weapon...
This makes me sad
7:27 Kirby would think it was dedede, think about it, let's say someone you know likes cake and is known for eating a lot of it and then one day you buy a cake and its stolen if your cake was stolen what would be your first thought?
A. My friend who likes cake
B. someone you don't know


I know its not the main focus of the video and I know Kirby isn't truly "evil", i'm just saying that Kirby couldn't of done a investigation since he's basically a child
Hey look a two-parter series that he actually labels properly so it's easier to find üëèüëçüëå
Next theory: WADDLE DEE IS A VILLAIN
Damn, first Mario, now the innocent gumball Kirby. Who next? Ricardo? Waluigi?
Of course he is a god!!!
I like being the hero in games but I love being the villain
People give Kirby too much credit for too willing to help others but imagine if Kirby decide to NOT help Ribbon to collect the crystal shard. Zero will be unstoppable and will destroy everything.
Mario Like My This If Your FINE AND DANNY
He is a baby dude
I just need some time to think about my life right now...
Well, this pretty much settles it with quadruple "C"s... Kirby is a Buu o_o'
Color
Character
Concept
CONFIRMED!
Dreamland needs to call up Beerus.
Kirby is literally kratos but more savage
Maybe this series was always about how being too naive for the real world doesnt just put you in danger but also everyone arround you.
So is MetaKnight dead? I like that guy very much.
Now I understand why Kirby is always angry in the american versions
"Kirby is neither good nor evil, he simply is ."
He's an amoeba with one task. Food and power XD.
a game character is only as evil as the player makes them
You can trust me :( im your friend
Honestly I‚Äôm kirby, you take my food, u dead
No questions asked
Kirby is canonically just a baby and don't know any better he's just a little dummy...also Daroch  unleashes dark nebula not kirby....so yah
"But Kirby's just a baby!" That's not a good excuse. It's on him that he often makes the wrong decisions. He may not have evil intent, but he's still just looking out for himself and often gets pushed in a bad direction.
so basically Kirby is Majin Buu lol
So Kerby = Majin Buu
Know the response I give, either a Kirby is a child or b Kirby is a simpleton who is easy to control.
Just take a look at ‚ÄúKirby‚Äôs Screaming Adventure‚Äù.
I think that‚Äôll give you the proof you need.
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU OLD MAN?!
Game: Has a subtle plot that reveals a darker layer to the ‚Äúhero‚Äù
Matpat: outstanding move
Kirby is the hecking strong and if you faced him he will defeat you with just his stand [ Z A S U C C ]
Thanos: I will destroy half of the universe 

Kirby: hold my beer
Matpat:next week new episode 
Me:waiting for episode
In cannon, Kirby is a part of void in star allies; he escaped and formed his own mind just like gooey from dark matter.
Mario is a communist
Peach is a selfish goddess
Kirby is a destructive alien
What next Metroids are all thats left of humanity?
11:57 RIP Robbie Rotten. 3:
It seems like Japanese game devs like hiding "dark" content in cutesy games. Look at those seriously messed up Pokedex entries for the Pokemon
I think it‚Äôs just Kirby‚Äôs not very smart
The tiny pink cute puff ball is being              targeted
This intro never gets old
Still ruining my childhood, I love this guy :D
Kirby is Majin Buu
wait what about in kirby triple deluxe  when he wakes up to find his house in a giant bean stalk? Doesn't he find out that the dude with six hands kidnaps deedee and goes on this whole quest to save him? correct me if I'm wrong.
So, you're basically saying Kirby is just a destructive puppet of ignorance?

(And by puppet, I mean easily manipulative.)
If he's evil, why did he save everyone in World of Light?
DEDEDE IS THE GOOD GUY PEOPLE!!!
I've been waiting for this day... thank you MatPat
So to control Kirby you need food  üç∞üç∞üç¶üç≠üç´
I have no intention of trashing your theory, however, the creatures kirby is related to are created by positive emotions or negative emotions. thats why in star allies the main villian is a destoryer of world because hyness was filled with hate and jealousy while trying to summon him. With the same boss it mentions that this summoned creature can be good JUST BY BEING AROUND KIRBY AND TAKING IN HIS POSITIVE INFLUENCE. plus, isnt kirby just a child? and we know that kids can be stupid and manipulated :T
Edit: 
Helping people is the only way in the kirby world
Looks like someone‚Äôs been watching Woolie‚Äôs Kirby lore videos
Have you ever considered that Kirby may just be stupid?
Kirby anime: dedede is the bad guy kirby is the good guy.
Kirby games: dedede is the good guy kirby is neutral.
... i mentioned the anime.
Video game character: *Exists
Game Theory: Chaotic Neutral!
King DeDeDe: Surely you be jestin'!
So.... He is like a mercenary.
If he's "paid" he dies almost everything.
Just like a mercenary.
Kirby hasn't even reached his true potential. He would reach his true potential in 100 or 200 years (I don't remember exactly).
I honestly think your reading into Kirby a bit too much.
Kirby should be a Keter-SCP class, being able to destroy the entire world if it wanted easily
In case it hasn't already been said-to-death by the other Commenters, part of why Kirby is so-easily duped is because, in accordance with Hoshi no Kaabi/Kirby of the Stars canon, Kirby is a LITERAL "baby" Star Warrior.
His Warp Star spaceship is like Kal-el's pod from his origin story (and unironically(?), Kirby is one of the last-born Star Warriors due to NME's machinations, like maybe his home/birthworld was destroyed and Kirby was the only one to make it), and he was meant to be taken to a world OTHER than Pop Star to be raised to Maturity, since there's a lot of evidence suggesting that Kirby and Meta Knight are the same species of alien; in fact, Coloration might be an indicator of age, since IRL, infant skin coloration doesn't "set in" for a few weeks after birth, so a "white" baby could still turn out "brown" a while later.

Your theory thus-far has been really good, but I still feel the need to put in my Two Cents, since Kirby being a BABY with a still-developing mind and single-minded fixation on sustenance, all babies really CAN fixate on since their Developing Brains need Nutrition to develop, would be just-as-good an explanation for him unknowingly endangering the world around him. As a baby, he doesn't have the CONTEXT necessary to know TO ask these questions like "why".
Though admittedly, since I haven't PLAYED all these games, there might be more evidence to all this Neutral Chaos God business you've been going on about.

Guess I'll just have to wait until then. Until then, remember, it's just a theory. A FAN theory. Thanks for reading.
Heres stuff regarding the games
So kirby the amazing mirror huh Mirror kirby is he the same as the normal kirby remember the line we'll use it later "Don't worry! Mirror Kirby will help!" Is this kirbys perpisce or not?  So is he a war god too...? But then again look at the line "Don't worry!Mirror Kirby will help! " that means that he's probably the name Mirror Kirby he could be the opposite of a war god a peaceful God\Godess who stops the War god basically a chaotic good then there's the 64 game the crystal shards HE LITTARY HELPS A FAIRY HE DIDNT KNOW NOT EVEN KNOWING IF HE IS BAD OR NOT it's truly a mess Also use the fnaf voice agian
Taking into consideration this theory, it sounds like Kirby has a severe form of ADHD.... coming from a person who has a family history of ADD and ADHD (though I don't have it myself, 2/3 of my siblings have ADHD and 4/5 of my direct family have either ADD or ADHD (the 1/5 is my mother who has 0 mental disorders) so I know quite a lot, and that's paired with my love for mental health and learning about mental disorders)
I think game theory should now be called- 'Matpat ruining your childhood every week'.
I thought he was an amoeba.
üòè
Kirbys a freaking POYO
i have seen the hate coming from the comments from the Kirby fan base but i agree he is a literal walking black whole and he doesn't even car what he eats or who he eats
Keep up the great videos 100001010001001010000
Matpat when will ypu get us part 2???
About the mario theory of him destroying toads that had been turned into blocks did he knew or didn't knew did he purposely do it or was it an accident ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
soooo Kirby is Beerus?
So what you're saying is... Kirby = Golb?
3 of the reasons of were Kirby messes up are not Kirby's fault
It‚Äôs been stated Kirby is a kid, not just in the anime but the games, he‚Äôs young and naive and that‚Äôs why he does all these things, the times he was tricked with the crown was because he wanted to help someone who looked like they were In need of help, this theory just seems unfair when his character is made to be naive and this theory is cutting out the good parts of the things he did
Congrats. You now angered the entirity of the most happiest fandom of the universe. 

Take this theory down now
Kirby, the true Chara of Starland! 
(Scary stuff...)
Kirby is the most entitled creature in dreamland 3. Wake me up? I BEAT UP YOUR MOM!
Hey i just watched one of yours doki doki theory‚Äôs and when you said ‚Äò it runs in a family.‚Äô ( diagnosis about riener family) I thought of what I got in my genes that hasn‚Äôt been seen before ( this is true) so I thought that what if the family has some genes what the doctor is trying to find out. This is just a thought but could be true.
I know where is this going, and have a look, in Kirby Star Allies Void Termina description, says that is just like a mass that transforms into feelings, if it is used ok, he can be even a friend.
Kirby just want to do good, but is Kirby, is just innocent and don't know what he is doing, maybe sometimes he is angry because his cake was stolen but I don't see it
I just noticed how epic your intro is... HOW DO YOU DO THAT?!
But in the intro, there is no Diet Coke!



are you okay matpat
When you think about the Kirby is like fallout. A strange world with  survival put first and a neutral character doing what he/she wants.
Interesting...the hate ratio is lower than I thought...
You promised us Part 2 this week D:
Do Touhou or the channel will never be complete!
kirby is like brainless nuclear weapon
Made by Dedede Gang
0:50  why did kirby just inhale a scarfy?
Hehe i actually knew about this already
I am a kirby fanboy, why must you do this to me.
Do god of war
The theory doesn't take into account things like Kirby 64, where he selflessly decides to help a stranger save her planet, or Kirby triple deluxe, where he answers the request for help by the sky people, and seems to ignore the fact that in milky was wishes, the damn sun and Moon are fighting. Screw these guardians, he needs to make the damn sun and moon stop fighting. And of course he thought Dedede took his cake, Dedede was known for doing stuff like that. Dude stole all the food in dreamland. Why would Kirby think otherwise or trust him in Adventure? Dedede is kind of a dick. But I know where you're going for part 2, and I can't argue against what you're going to say as the games have been heavily hinting at it.
Kirby is literally the fat Majin Buu from dragon ball super
Aren't Kirby and metaknight of the same race?
I like how matpat forgot that the evil face in soul melter was just an easter egg from the anime kirby right back at ya.
Get ready for a another fnaf theory because fnaf the movie is coming out in the year 2020 so new theory can be happening in the movie in your theories can get debunked and some of your theories can be true but also new theories can be coming so that's why I think you should make another fnaf theory.üò±üò±üò±ü§óüòÑ
MatPat!!! RED ALERT RED ALERT Scott is developing FNAF VR!!!
Kirby: the chaotic neutral amoeba
ok mat... can I just enjoy game?
You can trust kirby just don't mess with him.
or on the internet people draw kirby p**n, why kirby fans? why?
kirby = chaos toddler
Matpat sweet sweet die et cola of vectry ;)
There‚Äôs something wrong.

1. Yes Kirby did destroy the Nova, but magolor clearly states there are clockwork Stars. As if there were many of these novas. And to support that there is indeed more than one nova in Kirby Planet Robobot we see a completely different nova not to mention in a Planet Robobot Q&A it is confirmed there‚Äôs a nova for every solar system.

And also, I bet your gonna talk about astral birth void reincarnation shenanigans as that is extremely viable to explain not even how Kirby acts, but what he IS.
Do basically... Kirby= Majin Buu+ Lord Beerus?
When will metaknight have his own game where kirby is the villain
Cats are liquid?
Welp, We all know the Void Termina Lore is coming...
The only reason why I came to this video is because of Kirby‚Äôs mouth in the thumbnail üòÇ
13:12 ‚ÄúGlorified Candy Crush mod‚Äù? I‚Äôm not gonna let you disrespect Puyo Puyo like that!
Well Kirby is a bacteria cell, and bacteria do like to destroy stuff...
Well then why does Kirby help collect the crystal shards? What selfish goal does he have there? And you know he doesn't unleash any of the dark matter (except dark nebula). Zero, zero 2, dark matter from KDL2, none of them were released by Kirby, so what gives?
here's a theory. What if Kirby, to deal with all of these innocent deaths in the early games, developed bipolar disorder and ended up having two or more split personalities. This would explain why he has that expressionless look because his personality could be one void of emotion or concept.
Wait.. chaotic neutral Kirby
WELP BETTER DRAW MY DND CHARACTER AS A KIRBY
So you know she‚Äôs a wizard Tabaxi. We took a different race to adapt it into 4E
Edit: Jeez why does this have so many likes
Talk about the new FnaF teaser for 2019 ( FnaF : Into Madness) and about the other stuff talked about aswell

Like who agrees
Don't forget the sketchy history of Dream Land 3 and Crystal Shard's development.
Mat pat 

There is a teaser for the new fnaf game..
Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs real though
You have to play When The darkness Comes. Download both online file and steam file of the game to see what everything means. It would be great.
I want to know how to do pixel measurements, so I can SCIENCE fictional plumbers and elves
He's a well mannered shoggoth, what do you expect?
Do fnaf vr theory when it comes out cuz it will be different and possibly add extra story
Well I mean he's pretty much Nintendo's Majin Buu
You should do a theory on Terraria
Mat please do more games that have lots of lore
is like E.Gadd
I want trust Kirby
but earlier you said Kirby was a single-celled thing with nublys. and single-celled things have 2 goals: eat and thrive. so he will do almost anything to eat.
But he's still good in Super Smash Bros.
Kirby's just a baby of his race, he doesn't really care about the well-being of most other people. He acts for his own wants and needs, and the results of his actions just happen to coincidentally be good and benefit some other people. And since he's not mature enough to be clever and to think through his strategies well, he can be reckless and go to crazy measures to get the job done. He doesn't care what he has to do or what happens in order for him to get his way, he just goes without thinking. Perfect definition of a young, undeveloped, chaotic-neutral mind.
Dude I love your theories but this one really dosen't have much merit and is far fetched especially since kirby is a baby it is obvious and stated multiple times but like you always say it just a theory
I think he's a lot like Deadpool. On top of that, he just pretends to be clueless baby, to have more fun...
I fully agree that Kirby is pretty much Chaotic Neutral, but we shouldn't ignore games like Triple Deluxe and Planet Robobot, where Kirby, out of his own free will, goes after Taranza to rescue King Dedede and investigate Popstar's mechanisation respectively. 
He's definitely not purely selfish, is what I'm trying to say; he does have a concept of good and evil.

Then there's also the fact, that all enemies he defeats immediately respawn. To me, this signalises that he does not at all kill these creatures, he just knocks them out for a tiny bit. Sure, it's still somewhat needless violence, but not as dramatic as it's made out to be.
We can also see in Smash Bros., that even foes that are swallowed and copied are not actually killed in the process. Hell, Kirby can even swallow/copy his friends in Return to Dreamland withot harm done to them.
kirby is just a baby
Honestly, I never liked Kirby
12:25

Kirby: (DBZ abridged Mr.Popo laugh)
Well R.I.P. Sakurai who didn't want Kirby to get too many sequels
A new five nights Freddys games coming out
Don't judge me...I still NEED Kirby in ma life...
He made a 19 min video on what sonic for hire portrays Kirby
Ralsei is Asriel if you arrange the letters
So Kirby is the chaotic neutral
Hey matpat I saw ur TikTok can u make a video (if u have time) about what‚Äôs happening I‚Äôve looked on both ur channels and I haven‚Äôt found anything hope u guys r good
0:26 Matpat=Kirby?!?!
Soooo Kirby is buu... Like exactly buu
Do a theory on Minecraft disc 11 and 13
Not defending the theory but he did say CHAOTIC NETURAL!!
ME : Kirby a cute ball of kindness


DI DI DE : of you think so huh hes destroyed planets and killed people

ME : hes a fricken baby
If you're arguing against MatPat at this point, I just cannot WAIT for Void Termina.
YAY! Back to the old-school! Destroying childhood Nintendo characters one video at a time!
Kirby made his own planet by shooting a huge star into space.
but he is cute tho
I wonder who Kirby's ancestors are?
Puyo Puyo, a Candy Crush mod? Sorry, never played it, but the only similarity I see is that it's on a grid. Fire Emblem is ripoff Puyo Puyo is ripoff Candy Crush is ripoff Tetris is ripoff Minesweeper.
He always less optomistic than unaligned. He justs assumes the person he's helping is good
Matthew Patrick did u hear that there's a new teaser for




FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS

Edit: wow 4 likes thanks guys
Edit 2: wow 36 likesThanksYou
And I thought fnaf VR was a game in your episode but now it's irl
so in theory, Kirby is literally just todays Tweens but more destructive
Ok but what about kirb the meme + i don't care that kirby is evil he's cute
Could you please look back at the for Honor video you did, you messed up a bit.
Save me Fnaf VR is coming hELP
3:00 :-0
when is the part 2 coming out
Chaotic Neutral
Can you do a theory on the game terraria?
Why you ruining Kirby?!
Notification Squad. Also, now I want cake üßÅ
Kirby is just like a lot of anime, game, and mythology characters.
He is majorly gullible, headstrong, and not extraordinarily smart.

Just like Heracles, Ichigo Kurosaki (for you weebs, during the final arc), or others.
thank you so much matpat, very cool
I havent watched the video yet BUT in the guide it says that he literally has infinite power so... bow down
He also kills and eats eldritch gods for fun
How many times do I have to say Dreamland would still be without it‚Äôs dreams even if Dedede broke the star rod, and also he is just a baby and you‚Äôre saying he is a god of destruction.
theory debunked I mean people in the comments explain
MATPAT HAVE U SEEN THE NEW FNAF TRAILER ITS CALLED FIVE NIGHTS AT ROXYS OMG ITS LIT IT COMES OUT MAY 31
Tbh I would fight for some good strawberry shortcakes
any one look through the scottgames.com archive lately pretty interesting stuff
Why doesn't anyone remember that Kirby is a baby?
2:22 I‚Äôm sorry but that book isn‚Äôt NEARLY thick enough to have all of the Kirby lore
Still waiting for that Danny Phantom theory, Matpat. I'm gonna keep mentioning this until you deliver.
That said, this Kirby tbeory is pretty cool.
Wake up Sleepy Head !
FNAF VR is commin' right around the corner !
Gear up MatPat ! Yah ain't done with the war yet, Scott's still messin' with yah !
MATT!!! SCOTT¬¥S SITE HAS CHANGED A LETTER!
THE NAME OF THE SITE NOT THE LINK! THE NAME IS: Scot0t¬¥s Games 
AND THE NAME ON THE TOP NOT THE you know that logo not that. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT IT, PLEASE!!!
every time he says "kirby" you have to take a shot
Any one think that Dark Nebula could be related somehow to dark star from, Mario and Luigi Bowser's inside story?
Go meddle in someone else's affairs Squishy!
Theorys of fnaf 7 are coming get ready
Matpat and steph was part in the voice acting of the video spiders and bees by the odd 1s out
this was exactly why kirby didnt die in the trailer for world of light
I am sad for the bird
Can't he be both
I have a theory! Get matpat on the line!
And that's why Kirby is the best character in Smash Ultimate.
Us: OMG we love insert game character here 
Matpat: slams down 5,000 pages of evidence WeLL ActUaLlY-
Ah yes the true villain of Kirby... Simplistic plot writing. DU DU DUHHH
So beerus vs Kirby. 

Take away their door and blame it on the other and watch the universe implode.
Kirby isn‚Äôt a hero nor villain... nor neutral. He is a straight up savage
God of destruction?
What is this, dragon ball super?
kirby is just dummmmm
This is the dreamland shop 
1like: ‚≠êÔ∏èWarpstar 
1Comment: üçÖFood
Free: Exotic Butters lol
IDK why but I feel like Kirby being a big threat has to do with Galacta Knight. (If you don't know who he is, he is basically a super powerful space warrior and a boss in Kirby)
Once you hear something is two parts:
¬∑Like the video
¬∑wait for second part
¬∑nap
¬∑play sly cooper
¬∑nap more while watching all the FNAF theories on this channel.
¬∑play all 4 games of sly cooper
¬∑notice you waisted your whole summer/spring break/Winter break/life.
im gonna remind you matt its not that im trying insulting you or saying your theories are wrong but remember Kirby is still a todler so his true nature is A TODLER THAT DOESNT KNOW WHATS RIGHT OR WRONG
I want to see a game theory episode showing something positive  off of some charector  but overall good episode.
who else saw the reactions to this video on r/kirby?
Kirby just sounds like a true psychopath
oh no then is namjoon a reincarnated Kirby god of destruction * sorry armys ill take my leave now*
ok I have a request... idk if u covered it or not... but is shiny sylveon and regular sylveon sisters or alternate selfs? im very confused...
You should do a theory on the timeline of the Uncharted series. The games have so many flashbacks and random numbers thrown in; it would be interesting to see how old Nathan Drake actually is.
Mat you need to check out nes godzilla creepypasta (yes thats the literal name) I think you'll enjoy it
hey, you ruined my headcannon :(
How about Jse theorise please do it
Oi, @MatPat I have a source code from Scott Cawthon "REMEMBER JEREMY" your welcome. Please get on this!!!
I bet part 2 goes into how void from star allies turns into Kirby or whatever and that‚Äôs his whole basis
Never forget that king deduce LITERALLY STOLE an ENTIRE POPULATION‚ÄôS food source!
0:56 Kirby can‚Äôt eat Scarfy (orange cat looking thing)
14:20 nintendo covered up the fact that they were bricks with the rescue the toad mission in new super mario bros wii
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now confirmed that... spins wheel KIRBY is now evil!‚Äù
We are looking to sponsor your channel. Email us for more details
Dedede, The True Hero of The Dreamland
Meta Knight, The True Savior of The Dreamland
Kirby, The True Evil
I know it all from the start!
Kirby is just a baby anyway but not a normal baby, a dangerous baby
MatPat: Finally, i‚Äôm done with fnaf.






Scott: 
Hakai-shin Kirby-sama
Can you do a theory about master cheifs new ai
You should make a game theory  on roblox
No room for brains in this little, cute marshmallow. The embodiment of looking innocent but being incomparable evil and destructive.
Now I wait for a official game where Kirby fights another literal entity of destruction because it invaded his realm of rule.
You did not just compare a Puyo Puyo reskin to Candy Crush of all things...
Big belly
But not enough room for a brain
What is kirby? Chaotic neutral god ameoba...yeah, don't forget about that last part ya matpat?
One of my friends once told me that Kirby, in all games to date, is technically still a baby and has not yet matured. This does explain some of his motives when looked at from that view but what will he be like when he is fully mature then?
Shhhhh don‚Äôt tell anyone 







Wait...
tHiS iS faKE donT bELive iT
This is why I main King DeDeDe
rip puyo puyo, death by glorified candy crush
After the part two or however many there are do a theory over the humans in splatoon 2: octo exspansion
Hey Matpat or anyone that see's this is a copy of a comment I just posted about DDLC if you wanna make another theory about it: I searched up Markov and got Andrey Markov. This is a bit I got from wikipedia about him: Andrey Andreyevich Markov was a Russian mathematician best known for his work on stochastic processes. A primary subject of his research later became known as Markov chains and Markov processes. Markov and his younger brother Vladimir Andreevich Markov proved the Markov brothers' inequality. If any hardcore theorists read this I suggest reading anything and everything about this guy and show Matpat what you find.
Like majin buu
Kirby a b
Why didn't you talk about how Kirby took care of dyna blade's chicks?

Edit: and how dyna blade agreed to help Kirby and meta knight straight up shot her down in the process?
1:04 Actually If You Look In That Manual Of Dream Land, They Call Him "Little Boy" So He Isn't a Female.
Cant wait for part 2, but this was the video in a nutshell

hey Game Theory I think you should do a theory about the Smash Bros and like how hard you hit him whenever the hit thing goes up it's just my suggestion
I have a good theory video and it is of battle block theatre that if hatty hattington is still alive

#whenyoulikeyourcomment
I consider Kirby to be more like Lennie from of mice and men or just a very powerful baby boy.
Kirby is young warrior in the show also and he is a walking black hole I think he and he always kills it
Game theory: how well can herbs actually heal you?
Can you please make a theory for hungry shark world
I just hope mat reads this because it concerns Ronnie:

Every human has an intricate maze in their head. We are all conditioned from our childhood and our adolescence. 
I believe nobody should ever have to contemplate suicide.
However, everyone has a different maze. different demons. different game. 
The maze can make or break us. Because our "mental maze" defines everything we are.

Fear kills us. Fear murders relationships. We all are scared of something. And love is the only answer.
We must, as individuals, learn how to truly value ourselves. And, as individuals, we must learn to love those who are suffering.
It is a delicate dance. If the individual is suffering, if the individual does not know how to value themselves; it will be a rocky road. 
How does an individual learn true self worth, then?

Service. True service, true reward.
I wake up, i am hungry. Before I eat, I must service. I EARN my food, by servicing. 
I volunteer. I help others become happy before I am happy.

Paradoxically, this is what works. We must work towards the happiness of others, so that in return, we become happy.
This cycle is perpetual. If every individual thought this way, low-self esteem would cease to exist.

However, you must commit to service. If you do not service someone, you will torture yourself needlessly, because life is NOT about you! 
Life is not about me, not about you, not about them . . . as soon as we make it about us, we become ego-centric. 
We want to become service-centric. 
If my service brings a smile to someone else face. . . then I deserve to live!

If I never service, and I remain egotistical, then I deserve death."

That is what I believe. 
I believe that.
New fnaf teaser. Brace for impact.
Yes people that know "the thing"that is one of my favorite creepy movies. Going along with the Mist, saw, Chucky, and especially.. animal graveyard.
Mat Pat what is dead by daylights Entity?
you satanic man
Uh. We already know this. It's pretty much basic knowledge.
Your all wrong. Kirby is a price of bubblegum. Silly matpat
"Deal with it M9"
God of destruction Kirby vs Ultra instinct Goku
As a Kirby and the amazing mirror speed runner this offends me
Sorry but I Trust kirby because the world of light
This gives me reason to fight kirby in super smash ultimate
Step 1 identify the subject

Step 2 make people believe subject's evil

Step 3 learn how to kill subject.
You fool kirby is MADE OF POSITIVE ENERGY AND LOVE THAT WE GIVE HIM
Thank god I thought this was going to be something dumb like talking about how Kirby comes from the same energy as dark matter so that makes him evil.
Kirby is just kinda dull headed. He's got the mind of a small child with no clue what's going on
Hey matpat. Your are gonna be SO MAD at Scott because he released a new teaser. It‚Äôs for fnaf vr. MORE STUFF MAT PAT ALL OF US ARE WAITING
Kirby is a toddler. Yeah, he's a neutron bomb of chaos. But he's not evil! He just has no mental capacity yet.
Plz do a theory about king dedede's hamer how strong it is it will be fun if you did this theory.
MAT PAT I JUST FOUND sOMETHING BIGGgGggGg
In fnaf mike or if that even is his name he lives in a little small 
room with one door you know that from the mini games 
But not 2 doors and hallways so mike and the crying child are different
And mike is not the older brother but he is the child that ‚Äúwent to that place again‚Äù
But he is kind of the crying child in the mini games but not in the child in the nights
We play in fnaf 4.

(Sorry not about Kirby and matpat will have make a hole new time line
I think all this went off on the wrong foot because of the straight up deceptive title that initially went with the video. Calling him the villain yet explicitly stating in the video itself that he isn't necessarily a bad guy  is very misleading. If the current title were what it was from the start, there would probably be less of an outcry from some people


I personally am completely okay with this theory, I liked it, but I am not okay with the clickbait titles that are inevitably changed cause of the negative feedback (cause of course you would change  misleading title after people get mad at it)
Imagine if Madpat did theories in 2014 about the Zombies Storyline in thr Treyarch COD games
He‚Äôs the love child of Majin Buu and Ganon. Of course he‚Äôs evil...
I would like to make a few points
1.) Most of this is pretty obvious
2.) Dedede stealing the cake in squeak squad was a pretty damn good guess based on the past.
3.) I don't think he is a danger at all because despite all the points you made in the end he always cleans up his mess.
Mat! I really wish you could cover the Minecraft Discs 11 and 13 and their strange audio.
I know there‚Äôs not a lot behind them, but really anything about them would be really cool.
I knew Kirby was evil before the video was made
So basically he's a super powered puppy
Kirby is still adorable
Kirb*
Bfdi theory hmmmm
15:38 Yes, you are right, but he at least feeds the baby birds, and teaches them how to fly. So either he ain't the worst guy in the universe, or it's just a thing you left out. I don't know. I don't know why I typed this comment. Welp, stuff happens.
"Kirby is a reincarnated god of destruction"? I sense Void Termina being mentioned in part 2.
A Kirby video on MARIO day?!? Whatever. Kirby's better anyway
Dyna Blade: Dyna Blade was stealing all of the crops. What would you do in that situation? She's a freaking giant birb. Are you saying that Kirby should've just came to her and ask her nicely why she did that? No, he wanted to protect the crops because he cares about Dream Land.
Nightmare: Dedede already stole all of the food in Dream Land before. And remember, after he broke the Star Rod he took a shower in The Fountain Of Dreams like a nasty boi. If you were Kirby in that situation, you wouldn't believe him either.
Also, in Kirby: Triple Deluxe, The People Of The Sky send the Dreamstalk to locate THE HERO of Dream Land. Kirby is, in fact, The Hero Of Dream Land, hence why the Dreamstalk lifted him to Floralia.
Kirbys a friggan sjw; no investigation, no evidence, just jumping to conclusions and springing into action ‚Äújust fixated on whatever strikes him in the moment‚Äù
I always preferred yoshi over kirby 







Now I have another reason why not to choose him as a character
Hmmm he didn‚Äôt do something before the intro... he‚Äôs dying but this is just a theory a fan theory
You should do a theory on ‚Äúthe room‚Äù series. It is on the App Store and has a very interesting lure.
Do a theory on Yume Nikki: Dream Diary!
Kirby is a star warrior. It's not exactly clear what star warriors are but Metaknight is one. They mature after centuries, he'll continue being a baby for who knows how long, but star warriors are canonically good.
Let‚Äôs all be honest, if anyone in the Nintendo canon is a god/goddess of destruction, it‚Äôs Sakurai: the entity who collides universes and forces their champions into battle with each other for the sake of entertainment. (We KNOW what you do, but we love you for it Sakurai.)
Matpat when calculating all of the characters in smash you forgot about the Pokemon characters that come out of their pokeballs possibilities.
In smash ultimate the boxer map says kirby is a pink demon
It better  be
Hey Matpat: do little nightmares plz
KING DEDEDE D-DONKEY KONG
I thought Kirby was a baby
Kirby is god incarnate


ALL HAIL KIRBY GOD OF DEStRUCTION
When did kirby open datk nebula? That was only daroaches fault, not kirby‚Äôs
Welp, Matpat is wearing his tin foil hat again.
Pt. 2: KibRy is VOID TermInA REInCaRNaTed And tImE tRAvEl aNd sTufF
I'm sorry but I was honestly was getting more and more pissed off as the video went on. I feel like that some of the points of hurting innocents doesn't really hold up with 2 words, game mechanics. 

Most of the reasons I saw was just "Kirby's mass destruction was for nothing because he was in the end helping the bad guy" which I kinda have to say is how else do one design a 2D platformer without a way of attacking, kirbys core design was to be simple and just to inhale and spit, with copy abilities later on. You also could just choose not to fight and ignore most enemies if needed and fly over them. I was just screaming game mechanics over and over as the video progress and I'm pretty my point here can be dismantled easily with, "The point of kirby is to destroy everyone" or what ever intent but the whole villain thing though.

First off Nightmare,
You yourself stated the Dedede and Meta Knight were good even if their methods were questionable, so tell me what would kirby do if he saw dedede (after hoarding all the food in dreamland) swimming in the fountain of dreams and the star rod was missing, you would assume that he would try to get everyone's dreams back and if he didn't no one's dreams would ever happen and dedede didn't tell kirby anything till the last second so it's a bit of his fault. With that dedede helped kirby by launching him to the sky because of the fact they were panicking. Now the part

Marx and Magolor,
Okay now I just wana say apply what I said with game mechanics and then I'll talk about these two. Marx did use kirby but kirby really did want the sun and moon to stop fighting and he actually does, you never really mention that fact and the whole nova got destroyed could be true or not due to meta knightmare ultra showing him summon nova again but more broken. Now as for mags I can understand that other then game mechanics, landia really didn't deserve that. But kirby trusting to everyone he meets could also be a good thing.

Ribbon, if kirby didn't trust ribbon then dark matter would have taken over, ribbons situation is similar to Magolor/Marx but she actually needed help. In fact you say kirby is something good but mostly bad which I disagree with all my heart. He really helps more than actually causes damage, examples include ighting against dark matter in general including kirby 3 where with the power of his friends and helping everyone in that game he uses the love love stick, Kirby Canvus Curse/Rainbow Curse with  kirby stopping the villain from turing the world into paint or stealing all color, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror where he helps the mirror world, Kirby Triple Deluxe where he is saving king dedede, Kirby Planet Robobot where he stops haltman from stealing dreamlands resources, and Kirby Star Allies where he uses the power of friendship to stop and evil force. These are what I can think of on the top of my head.

Now some extra stuff

Kirby Squeak Squad is 100% understandable.

In the Japanese verison of Kirby Super Star, Meta Knight's Revenge had it so he just wanted to take over dreamland nothing more the English just added the lazy lifestyle part.

So I how you read this Mat and I hope you reply, I enjoyed this theory (even if I loved to hate it)
I hope you see part 2 and how you will try to prove kirby is a God of destruction (I don't wana talk about that now cause you didn't use any evidence yet)

So have a nice day
Bruh where is void termina lore
MatPat when are you going to do a theory about Yandere Simulator?? There's so many mysteries about that game that would make a great episode... and plus Yan sim has a lot of popularity a I bet it could bring a lot of newcomers to your channel.
you should do a theory on the game 'when the darkness comes'. it's a very deep game
I suspected this for so many years, thanks for the confirmation
Matt.... IT'S BACK 
 five nights at Freddy's...
Do a theory on the bendy 2 showdown bandit !
Matpat. Kirby got his powers FROM the tomato in Epic Yarn. Later in the game, when there's trouble in Dream Land, Kirby EXPRESSES WORRY because he's powerless to help. Not because of the Tomato. No offense here, but a serious question. Did you actually research epic yarn BEYOND the INTRO?
Void Termina's pause screen says he is "Impulsive, uncertain" just like a certain impulsive puffball who everyone says is related to Void... hmmm...
I always knew kirby had a evil side
I have a theory. That Galeem, Darkhon, Master Hand, Crazy Hand, Master Core and Tabuu are the same enemy. Master hand being the right hand represents pressure, crazy hand represents frustration. Galeem (who controls master hand in the story) is the right eye(he also stays on the right side of screen in battle). Darkhon is the opposite controlling crazy hand and is left eye and stays on the left side of screen in battle. Tabuu is the embodiment of balance between the two. Master core is the source of evil. For them hence he appears out of master hand or crazy hand in a double battle in smash 4 when the other is destroyed
Who knew a pink creampuff could be such a distractive God of eating
Kirby is a lovecraftian horror
Can u do one with Halo
Kirby ISN'T a bad guy
If kirby was a BAD GUY or a THREAT as you call him he would leave the situation bad, no good, staying evil. BUT he fixes dream land (or any other location that the bad guys are at). And KIRBY'S AVALANCH(a prominent game in your theory I might add) ISNT EVEN CANON, making a chunk of your theory invalid. He will still do the right thing in the end, THINK about it. Kirby wants his cake, Dedede has a history of stealing food, goes to dedede, doesnt have cake, Mysterious gang shows up (who end up giving him the cake), Get all the 6 stars for the star gate and corner them with the treasure he thinks is his cake, metaknight steals chest making him the Character of the hour, follows metaknight and beats him, leader of said gang takes the chest to find no cake but a force of evil. Kirby follows The Force of Evil, defeats the host, defeats the Evil, gets what he wanted in the first place while saving the entire universe. And kirby is a KID mind you, he's gulible so of COURSE he'd help people. And mat pat, sweet "inosent" mat pat, in Kirbys return to dreamland EVERYONE HELPS MAGOLOR BECAUSE HE'S A SEEMINGLY NICE GUY META KNIGHT, DEDEDE AND BANDANA DEE TOO, SO DOES THAT MAKE ALL OF THEM VILLIANS?!?!?!? NO BECAUSE YOUR MORAL HIGH GROUND IS TO PUT KIRBY UNDER THE BUS AND MAKE THESE "HERO'S" AS YOU SO CALL THEM HELP MAGOLOR TO. sorry for writing a book but you just went too far
How could you Kirby
I can't wait for "Game Theory, Why Cloud Strife is the TRUE main villain of Final Fantasy 7"
In the show Kirby Right Back At Ya Meta Knight says "Kirby came 200 years early, he cannot speak, and can barely think" Kirby isn't the bad guy just doing what he's told and destroying everything he was told to
Kirby SSU..

No matter what you do to bandanna dee
He is unharmed
He's just simple minded (big heart tiny brain)
I feel like kirby just doesn't want to be part of any of it but he gets dragged in it for something as so simple as cake!
you sir have had 1 2 many bowls of OATMEAL.
the next Kirby villain is gonna be mega Cthulhu and his 3 daughters who practice worshiping Satan
Hey matpat can you make a ENTER THE GUNGEON theory pls (and yes I write the gungeon right)
Kirby: okay, I‚Äôm hungry, I‚Äôm just gonna do what I always do, kill some people to get my food, and anyone will notice
MatPat: I HEARD THAT
Can you do how powerfull is the plants in plants vs zombies??
Pls
New protagonist that looks completely innocent 
Matpat:Hold my Beer
7:47 I love that sound Kirby makes. üòÇ
I miss this game.
Matpat:who is Kirby 
Me: Kirby is Kirby
Oh man, you included the Reddit logo. That's one step closer to actually crediting the communities you steal your content from.
i still frakn' love kirby
12:25 some men just want to watch the world burn
Hey Mat I don't want to see a beat up waddle dee
The Game theorists, making heroes villains since 2011
Kirby is a cake
isn't Kirby canonically an infant? That would certainly explain his impulse control issues
This video is honestly a bunch of crap. Most of it is cherry-picking information from the purposefully chosen games.

Kirby is basically a child (or at least has the intelligence of one), so obviously he would be fooled into doing bad things more than once.
Matpat, Kirby is a baby. Stop judging him.
Fnaf 7 has a teaser hahaha rip you
After do the true meaning of Super Smash Bros plz
While I dont know if it justifies or excuses anything, kirby is still a baby he doesnt understand anything around him hence all the "cake on a string" motives for him to save the universe.
Kirby is not the biggest threat in the biggest threat I am nightmare
You're starting to sound like the JJJ of the Nintendo universe.
Inb4 "I WANT KYRB-MAAAAAN"
‚ÄúGod Of Destruction......‚Äù





Namjoon....?
Is it just me or does matpat give anyone good workout back ground noise
When mario maker 2 comes you will need a mario plex ultra
How dare you not like Kirby!
Oh yay one of my favourite characters is now a mean person who eats and kills innocent people.....Yay.....He does save like most of the super smash characters doesn't he..So that's somthing good and at the begging of the adventure mode it shows a bunch of planets go into that light thing (I don't now if this is true I didn't do my research) So maybe he's redeeming himself
can matpat do some don't starve theory's? Anyone with me? No? Okay
THERES GONNA BE ANOTHER FNAF GAME WHICH MEANS MORE LOREEEEEE
Mario is a sociopath, Kirby is a god of destruction! this my friends, is why mat-pat has a diet coke addiction.
I have a thought that who is meta knight is he the same like Kirby or is he different
Who else was thinking something was going to happen when the intro started right off the bat?
Kirby is really Majin Buu....
When in the intro Kirby eats one of the cat things that he can‚Äôt eat in the games and you get triggered
But kirby should been waken 200 years later so he don't know what is the most inportent and he had a lot to learn before he was waken
Can you do a Sally face theroy
You guys love nugget so much and also I love nugget
When part 2?
Yea Kirby I'll never see you again th4 same.






I'll only accept you in smash
But game theroy Kirby is a baby so most of the time he does not know what he is doing sure he is a threat hey at link though in his other games he captures fairys. So my point link was based on capture,destory,save. Kirby is based on eat,save,fight. And also on the show Kirby is shown as a space warriors to destroy monster so his only pourpse was to destroy monsters this is why he goes guns blazing.
Are we just going to say all the Nintendo protagonist are bad?
Somebody :
Who is this kirby? I never saw and played any of his games but he seems fine.

Me:
You know... 
Kirby‚Äôs just easily manipulated.
There is a new fnaf game coming out soon!
Please do a theory
Someone never watched Kirby right back at ya
matpat we need a final fantasy theory
and this is why kirby has no voice
Perfect character for super smash bros.
Does Kirby ENJOY being evil?
Dang...and I thought Ink Sans was bad but Kirby takes the cake...pun not intended.
3:15
Ngl, but that scared me
Can you do a Apex legends theory, i don‚Äôt know what on, just it would be cool
New SCP: Kirby
You do know that Kirby is canonicallay a baby mentally, despite being over 200 years old.
While I do believe Kirby is a godly being that is reincarnated after every death (mainly because he shows several relations to Void Termina, who does the same), he does seem to have more positive influence and he knows what he is doing to others (not counting his interactions with Marx and Magolor).  Take Dreamland 3 for an example, Dark Matter started possessing almost everyone, probably including all, if not most of the minor enemies as well.  After this Dark Matter is freed from its vessel, the person returns to their normal state, most notably proven in Kirby 64.  In most other games, all of the enemies are against Kirby for a reason: they are a part of a greater force that influences them, such as Dedede, Dark Matter, Jamba Hearts, and possibly Marx.  According to Kirby Star Allies lore from what we currently know, which was barely touched on in this video, Kirby and Void Termina are beings that depending on what emotional energy, positive or negative, is used to fill their soul before reincarnation, determines how they will become when they are reborn.  This explains why Void was filled with so much hatred and dark power, as a Jamba Heart was required to restore his existence.  If we assume Kirby and Void are the same species, or possibly the same person from different dimensions, Kirby was likely reborn in something more pure, hence his desire to spread positive influence, and his innocent nature.  He may still be destructive and somewhat violent, but he's just trying to do whatever he can to stop greater evil.  If we look at a translation of a pause screen description for one of Void's battles, we can see what all four of the Matters can make up an entity's soul in this universe: Dream, Dark, Soul, and Heart.  We can guess Kirby is probably containing more Dream Matter, Soul Matter, and Heart Matter than Dark Matter, however he still contains some of its negative influences, such as willingness to destroy.  As a bonus, we can probably assume Void is made up of a lot of Dark and Soul, but very little Heart or Dream.  To conclude this probably unnecessarily long paragraph, Kirby is a god with destructive influence and a relative to another god of destruction, yet contains more positive influence than likely most entities in the universe.  All he wants is to stop evil in any way he needs, so he can in the end spread peace across the universe.
MatPat Please Please PLEASE do a video on the Dont Starve lore. It goes so deep with so many mysteries to solve
Well... Kirby IS a child
Ya but Kirby is pink and cuddly so it‚Äôs all good
mat fnaf is back it always does
Bayo!!!!!!!!!
GAME THEORY: MatPat is RUINING GAMES pt 1
What about "Kirby and the amazing mirror"
Also there is that older video game where kirby is the final boss or one of the end game bosses. As soon as he sees you, he tries to shove you down his belly just because he is hungry, no questions asked.
kirby is the most evil-est..and hes the one weho made everything wrong
hes the one who bring madnest
hes the true evil..how cute hes is or how adorable
but behinde of those things 
the clue of true evil
He is just a gullible kid who has no idea of hes powerüò•

If you think about it it is a description of a kid
If u change my mind about Kirby I either will be astonished or ticked
With all the effort you put into vids I'm kinda surprised you don't write the captions too
Krby is the most over powered character in smash
Can u do a theory about the mew fnaf teaser imagee
And also Kirby wouldn't have known any better besides isn't Kirby a baby
Does anyone remember when fnaf is the one where mat struggle
No intro scene?
Kirby is evil
Wait a second but what about games like star allies or triple deluxe
Wait a minute... WHAT THE HELL WOULD KIRBY SAY?!?! Ok. He did talk in star stacker. But that's hardly cannon.
Kirby is the villian. But the mastermind is MatPat. He is trying to throw Kirby under the bus to hide his true intension. Be the biggest consumer of Coke in the universe.
Well. Doesn't it speek in Kirby's favor that he can do good at all? If he is truly supposed to be so evil, isn't it amazing that he has been able to overcome it to a measurable degree?
Kirby‚Äôs species matures much slower than humans. He has a mental capacity not much more than a child‚Äôs. But I will admit he is still a pretty stubborn child.
You do know Kirby is canonically 3 years old right?
Space cult comes out of nowhere. IT‚ÄôS KIRBY‚ÄôS FAULT I‚ÄôM TELLING YOU
Even though it's just a theory....
It hurts me when you say bad things about Kirby because I grew up with Kirby T^T
Kirby is so powerful that they even had to limit his power in smash bros or else HE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY OP
Darned Game Theory! You destroyed something that was pure love, then you turned it into staten!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the best intro i've ever seen on youtube
Kirby‚Äòs a part of the fallen hero timeline
Kirby is  still a child so of course he‚Äôs gonna be gullible to deception
Hey if you want to push for Kirby being not good you will definitely need to say how he doesn't appeal to good as described by consolation of philosophy by boetheus.
Kirby is just nova's cousin.
no u ;(
Kirby is a Great Old One.
You know how nice it is for a theory to come together especially one where Scott is pulling the strings behind the strings and mine is coming together. We got the first 6 nights 30 more to go...
pls do a rwby theory or a dmc theory
KIRBY = BEERUS
Accidentally clicked the notification as it came up,I guess I‚Äôm early
Kirby is Majin and Kid Buu's Cousin
You... you do realize there‚Äôs a great explanation as to why Kirby acts the way he acts, right? He‚Äôs literally a child. Children are impulsive.

There. Saved you from watching a needless 2-parter.
I personal believe that Kirby is pure neutral and only does good because it effects him.
Where part two
So, Kirby is a baby. That is also another option. That is never brought up. It explains a lot of things like why he easily trusts these random strangers from space. Not only that but in the latest game, Kirby has nothing to do with releasing the villain and in fact shows mercy to them. The people who tried to kill Kirby like 3 times in total. Kirby not only spares them but even uncorrupts Hynes.
I know it's been 6 days since his videos been posted, but isn't Kirby a baby
Kirby is not a girl
Kirby is baby he don't know what is he doing and if you think what I am trying to say is that Kirby is a child but if they are not hirding then in game why are they hirding us
"Sonic for Hire" by Machinima figured this out first..kinda.
I don't know if I can ever forgive you for calling a Puyo Puyo reskin a glorified Candy Crush mod, Mat.

. . . yeah no, it cuts deep... . . . it cuts deep.
How is Kirby post to know if Marx is the corporate
holy $#%@
So Kirby act's like a child
Hey fights with instincts
Ngl when you were saying that some people think of him differently at the beginning I honestly thought you were gonna say something about vore, I‚Äôve been spending way too much time on my friends discord group chat
No, I think Kirby is Beerus's cousin.
What I want to know is if Kirby could beat Goku...
Kirby is just a death machine who eats anything that gets in his way and also really loved cake, so people are like "hey kirby, if you save us we'll give you cake" and kirby's like "ok then"
P A R T 1?
wow compared to kirby wario is a saint
And revenge The Kirby that is blue with a mask he just wanted to fight Kuby
You should definitely do a film theory on the bleach anime! Lots of cool twists in that series
Can you please do the Beyond you its like ddlc but i think its more mysterious please take a look at it pleaseeeeeeeee
loved this video
I thought Kirby was an amoeba......
Kirby is PURE evil i say...üòë
Kirby the hitman
What did you expect kirby is a imiba he is a single cell no brain
Kirby
the god of, not destruction 
BUT COMSUPTION
12:03 
That‚Äôs from the ‚Äúanime‚Äù when kirby crashes on dreamland and kinda has monsters chasing him. The monsters also destroy the town of the Cappys when they chase Kirby.
Then Kirby destroys N M E
Guess the Sonic for hire Kirby was accurate
10:10 exact description of majin buu üëÄüëÄ
4:05 really her ITS NOT A HER
kirby's a single-cell-organism
Me: Cant wait for matpat to debunk fnaf 7!
Matpat: AH CMON!
hes just a baby star warrior!! 
of course he dosent know whats going on!!
I relate to Kirby and most anime villains
Im so confuzzled. I thought kirby was an amoeba
Did Kirby just meowed?
14:56
seriously dude
You cannot change my opinion about Kirby
Technically landia was evil because of the crown
Hey matpat I have an theory about the legend of Zelda about gannondorfs father we know that Gannon was the reincarnation of Demise so what if Gannon was a Immaculate conception that Gannon‚Äôs mom gave berth to Gannon with out being pregnant but Gannon‚Äôs blood is Demises blood
Did you come out with part 2 yet if not when is it coming out
This might not be a good idea, remember the Mario one? Yeah, that one.
Lel I watched the thing
But did you put into calculation the two grump Kirby‚Äôs in Kirby‚Äôs dream land Game Grumps edition?
Ohhhhh. So that's how he escaped Galeem. By being a literal G O D .
I still wish that the channel would cover the crown in Kirby's Return to Dreamland
10:10
Rest in peace Meta
Rest in peace Magolor
Rest in peace Cake
Wait I thought Kirby was an amoeba!





An amoeba god!
well hold on a second kirby always starts out for food everything involes food
childhood dreams:Exists
Game Theory: FINALLY OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY!!!!
Kirby didn't like that.
What if it's Kirby is thinking that what he is doing is right yes isn't educated enough to understand the consequence and the concept of socialism
Lol, this just made me love Kirby more
You should do a theroy on the game Sally face
Mattpatt, can you do a theory based on how the apocalypse started in the game "Unturned"
Game Theory is the best channel ever
1:40 I swear to god he said "The umteeth time"
@TheGameTheorists

This is the true reason as to how Nova was born... üòÑüòÑüòÑ
Oh right; you guys wouldn't know.
My sibs and I were waaay into the different color/different character thing back when we played Smash 64. We wound up creating different OCs for Link, Samus, and Kirby. But it wasn't until MELEE came out that the white Kirby was introduced, and thus Nova, who had once been red like her Link partner, Cres (For crescent moon, except artfully misspelled) became white. She stayed a raging ball of sass and anger though. Mostly sass. She likes eating fancier things than a normal kirby, and will sometimes even be seen consuming wine, truffles, and dumplings, rather than normal Kirby foods. Her preferred weapon is the hammer.
I LOVE KIRBY
you know its real when it starts off with the intro instead of a skit.
Kirby is just goku
He is the reason why the bad things start happening
That is also why he did the shenron reference
Or just majin buu
This is a really bad video. You seem to forget that Kirby has large amounts of lore where Dark Matter, the main overarching villain, is the concentration of negative energy in the universe and Kirby himself is the opposite, a concentration of the positive energy in the universe. POSITIVE ENERGY. He is not the villian. There's some awesome flavor text about this in Star Allies (The RPG Monger had a great video about all of this lore).
Also, almost ALL of the stuff he does that's actually bad is an accident, and he fixes them immediately later. All of Dyna Blade was a misunderstanding, and he helped the kids afterwards. He was TRICKED by many of the villians. Meta Knight is definitely not a good guy since his very questionable ends definitely did not justify his means. Kirby thought that Yin Yarn's tomato was just a tomato and he was hungry.
Finally, King Dedede did kind of steal all of the food (or at least almost all of it) from innocent creatures who started to go hungry so I think that if they are ATTACKING YOU, then attacking them back is very justifiable, especially if it's to stop innocents from going hungry!

You could've made a great video involving actual Kirby lore, but nooooooooo, just had to go for the clickbait-y topic.
ummm do you NOT remember your theory as to how Kirby is an amoeba? If you do you should remember that he doesn't really have much emotion,his only instincts would be to survive MEANING when he goes to attack people because of food that's him attacking because they stopped him from surviving so he atatcks everyone in order to eat that food.Also him eating and killing everything isn't evil, to amoeba its just survival and he eats those people to gain their powers so he can continue to eat.Also if he IS an amoeba that means that he wouldn't really know what to do when bad things happen since all amoeba's do is try to survive and duplicate so that means he does whatever anyone tells him if it helps him survive in that scenario which is why at times such as when he defeated the four headed dragon he just watched the evil guy become strong because he didn't know wether or not if it was imperative to his survival to defeat him.
You do know that Meta Knight should have DEFINITELY been stopped, right? Even if his intentions weren't wholeheartedly evil, I'm pretty sure a fully-armed battleship getting ready to overthrow King Dedede means danger. Plus, the entire crew DID evacuate, and Meta Knight more than likely saved Sailor Dee.
me and the rest of the kirby community are getting are ray guns rn.
No wonder kirby is the most op char on ANY SMASH. He/she/it is a god
but he's an ameoba, how can that work?
said so yourself
If Kirby is descended from chaotic gods, then is Metaknight also a descendant, but one of his predecessors had a morality swap?
My friend watched this and he got SOOO mad (He LOVES Kirby)
Sure hope you consulted Woolie before making this
And kirby was made by nightmare according to the anima If that's cannon
a naive and powerfull god, i like this concept.
honestly I would go through that much if someone stole my cake
That's just kirby's personality he is gulable and helpful he is that guy that just really needs action and questions are last
Wait I thought Kirby was an ameba
These theorizes have gotten so lazy.
He just a hungry boye
Hey, Kirby just wanted his cake, and these dudes show  up, poor Kirby ;(
Do a bloodborne theory
This internally hurts me
lol Interesting...
Herro ma frends
Waddle Dees are basically King Dedede's slaves if you think about it
This title sounds familiar......




Wait is this another secret sociopath conspiracy theory like that Mario 2 part video a few years ago?
Matpat 2017: Kirby is an ameba.
Matpat 2019: Kirby is a dumb chaotic god of destruction.

Which one do you guys believe more?
TL,DW: Kirby is a catalyst, and is classed as "chaotic neutral".
2:02 cuts Kirby in half

Me: No, why?!
He's the precursor to Majin Buu. 
Think about it.
Actually Kirby in Kirby: Squeak Squad. He fights the enemy, because, the Squeak Squad opened the treasure chest instead of Kirby.
So, Kirby didn't nothing wrong in that game. You guess that in Milky Way Wishes and all Return to Dreamland he can maybe be the villian, but in Kirby's Adventure he just do what he believe that was correct.
10:51 He didn't do it FOR the magic tomato, he discoverd, shortly after he ate the tomato, that the evil magic man was turning people in dreamland to yarn, and he had to stop it
I'm going to tell Galacta Knight about this, you will pay for your horrible theory of Kirby being chaotic!!!
13:43 Okay, that does sound a little harsh (I'm talking about what kirby said)
7:26 Well, he obviously thought that because in "Kirby's Dream Land", King DeDeDe steals all the food, so, no wonder he thought it was old 3x De
Entertaining as always üëçüèº
DO APEX LEGENDS
I thought Kirby is a goku
Kirby deadpool confirmed?
13:10 Waddle Dee is just botherd by the idea of them being in the woods, but Kirby is being joyful, even though he doesn't let him leave the forest, that they can have a puzzle battle for fun
Well Kirby is said to be a very young star warrior (the same species as meta-knight) so of course he would be quite naive
#ghostpat
This is like getting a bird without doing research
From the team that brought you Mario is Mental‚Ñ¢
But for real, although I don't buy those claims, it'd be fun to get a part three
Oh, boy. I can't wait for him to explain Void and the Dark Matter trilogy.
Sr Pelo Kirby: you're not my friend
MatPat you went over this he is a(n)





Amoeba 

An entire video
Austin you know people would‚Äôve watched a 90 minute video
Where is the rest of this series though?  Demanding public wants to know.
Austin: "No one works for 24 hours"
Minecraft YouTubes in 2019: "Are you sure sure about that"
What if Minecraft Steve starts a large-scale, automated wheat/cattle farm?
Austin: "let's make a video series"
Also Austin: *doesn't make another video
I think the characters in LEGO Star Wars may be high up there. They have A LOT of coins in the end of the game and they can buy space ships for pretty low amounts.
Ah, Austin. The extravert to Matt's introvert. You never fail to give me a good time in your videos, and for that, I thank you.
11:30 "I found one thing that exists in both the real world and the game that you can purchase..." 

*Shows maple syrup on the screen* 

me: heh, cool, basing Mario coins off breakfast syrup, Canadians will love this theory.

Austin: "...cymbals!"


Wut?
what about the maple syrup in Super Mario RPG
Austin: *Promotes USA by using US dollars**
Also Austin: *Uses Celsius*
lol, even game theory's own theorists debunk matpat.
where is the next one austin
What about Saxton Hale? He can afford Heavy Weapons Guy firing his weapon for more than 12 seconds.
ok i have to ask. what the hell is the name of that first/intro song you ALWAYS use!?
I mean batman has a game series of his own





And he's batman
Wait.... so you worked out Luigi's worth based on 1 game, but combined all of marios games into 1 total [even ones where you can play as luigi.]
I was scared someone was stalking me when he said ‚Äúthat you watch on your toilet ‚Äú. Almost fell of my toilet
No hurry Austin, bur where is the second episode?
1:01 IS THAT HAMILTON I SMELL????üëÉ



Or am I just stupid.... (Hoping it's the first)
Steve can just give himself infinite diamond blocks in creative mode, so I think we already have our answer
‚ÄúStephanie Patrick named her feral tomcat after me‚Äù -Austin

Plz recheck minecraft. 1.14 now has stock market like trading. Try and do the research now, Austin.

Austin,2 months have passed. WHEN WILL THE SECOND PART BE RELEASED???
The guy from cookie clicker would win
Honestly, I would‚Äôve watched the movie
I like how the game is set to Super Mario Odyssey.
11:30 maple syrup is ON THE SCREEN! As a Canadian, my outrage is indescribable. 
A moose will be breaking down your door by dawn.
lol redacted as in SCP XD
We are forgetting the Titanium in Terraria!
The richest character in terms of personality is clearly the right facing L-Block form Tetris. Such depth.
Actually Emralds cost nothing like gold in real life because you can't craft it,eat it,drink it,wear it(in Minecraft you CAN wear gold!),use it without villagers and if you can't find a villager you can do just one thing:Throwing it into lava!








Also when Steve in Creative mod nothing has a value...Darn it Steve you destroyed economy!
Please make more vids in the series, pls

I just LOOOOOVE those Theorists channels!!!
And Austin's voice cracking over fantastically useless and yet epic and magnificent game financials is just perfect.

Why not call the series "Freakonomics Version 2.0"?
I have seen multiple comments saying that you could have just used maple syrup to get the value of coins so I figured I was bored and wanted to try to find out with the syrup. The first thing to figure out is how much maple syrup costs to begin with, and I found through the AgMRC that it‚Äôs worth $35/gallon (which is kind of expensive to me) in 2017. The next thing was to find out how much it costs in the game and how much syrup for that price. The maple syrup costs 30 coins in the game and it‚Äôs for about a 48 oz pitcher (seeing that 48 oz is a common size and in paper they are sold as pitchers). I found that 1 gallon is about 2.66667 pitchers (the 6 repeats) and multiplied the number of pitchers in a gallon by 30 (30 coins per pitcher) and got a nice even 80 coins for 1 gallon of maple syrup. I took the 80 coins for a gallon and divided it by the $35 per gallon and got a value of $2.29 for 1 coin. Now... I‚Äôm lazy and didn‚Äôt feel like re-calculating the whole value of Luigi‚Äôs mansion, so I just used his total of Luigi‚Äôs wealth ($1,058,604.18) and converted it into coins by dividing the total by the value Austin got ($1.66 per coin) and got the coin value of 637,713.3614457831 coins, and multiplied that by my coin pricing and got a total wealth for Luigi of $1,460,363.60. By multiplying the total number of coins in Mario (10,071,473) by the $2.29 I got Mario‚Äôs total of $23,063,673.17. This doesn‚Äôt change Mario or Luigi‚Äôs ranking, but it was fun to do and figure why not (and I did all this work so I was going to do something with it). If you read this whole thing thanks a lot and make sure to like so Austin can see (if i did something wrong please reply and tell me!)
Oh, it's multi part. DAMN YOU AUSTIN! GIVE ME HOURS LONG CONTENT!

I JUST CAME OUT THE TOILET SECONDS BEFORE HE SAID THAT
PART 2 NOW! Its been almost 2 MONTHS and it HASN'T BEEN RELEASED! Sorry I'm just exited for PART 2 NOW! Its been almost 2 MONTHS...
As a Canadian im really mad about how he overlooked the maple syrup 8n the shop
I can't wait for parts 2-99
Who do you guys like more?
Matpat or Austin




I like em both

Edit: Who wants me to tally all these comments up?
Plz finish this series when you get the chance. Thx!!!
Love these videos! Glad I'm not the one who makes them....sounds stressful. Can't wait for more!
SERIOUSLY WHERE'S PART TWO?
We want more :D pls  :)
Easy. The tycooner guy in Adventure capitalist
What about the Tenno in Warframe?  I think they'd be pretty rich.
Austin, you should add Aperture Science to the list (like GLaDOS's net worth or Cave Johnson's worth).
You forgot  captain olimar from pikmin (perferbly pikmin 2)
You aren't supposed to get emeralds by mining for them though. 
That was made purposefully inefficient. You could easily create a wheat farm and get way more wheat, cattle, lumber, or a plethora of other materials.
Minecraft villagers are scammers, I still believe Steve should be higher
on 16:15 Austin clams that film is dead.

Fun fact of the day:
Silver only tarnishes because of the sulphur produced by the Industrial Revolution. Before that, it didn't tarnish at all.
Thank you so much for featuring me in this video! I can't believe that I just got a shout-out from one of my favorite youtubers!!!
ep 2 ???
A Wakfu character did it first to watch the entire thing or just the final season on Netflix yes it's even on kids
Wario owns an oil company as seen in in game sponsor ships in Mario kart games throughout the years.
AUSTINN!!! YOUR SLACKINGG!!! THATS GOSH-DAMN TEERRRIFFYING!!! I have been waiting three weeks and still know second part what is up you made other videos since then unless, UNLESSss‚Ä¶ Your STALLING!
11:26 but you actually SHOWED maple syrup on the list! Maple syrup, I bet, varies a lot less in value depending on manufacturer and quality, too!
Watching while you go to poop...

I feel personally attacked
What about maple syrup?
It's an older, less well known game but you guys HAVE to do a theory on the Rusty Lake series. It's so good
You should do a video on how ungodly powerful the protagonist of Assassin's Creed Odyssey is. Particularly the sparta kick. Seriously, it can launch bears multiple feet.
I love the scp reference with the [REDACTED]
>Can't find anything in Mario RPG, finally found cymbals
>Is in Moleville shop which sells Maple Syrup while explaining this
Part 2 pls where's part 2?
‚Äúbillionaires who don‚Äôt shower‚Äù

Emma Chamberlin has a game!?
If you don't have a name for the series yet, you could call it, The battle of the... bronze...no, Gold, silver. Oh I know THE BATTLE OF THE BUCKS.
Austin: they make their money by painting
Me: literally currently playing a sim who's forcing all her friends to paint masterpieces and then sell them
Oh no
He's onto me
Austin, can you solve the science of hologram? BECAUSE THAT MAKE NO F*C*IN* SENSE! LIGHT NEED TO BOUNCED OF A SOLID OR REFLECTED BY LIQUID TO REACH OUR EYE! IT MAKE A LIGHT SHAPED IN AIR MAKE NO SENSE!
I'm hoping for the Courier. Idk why. I feel like it definitely won't be.
the richest will be obviously adventure capitalist protagonist
minecraft steve in creative mode grabbing blocks of diamond for a living

I‚Äôd come to your funeral
Just be sure to invite me
14:52 You mean 11.6
also Minebucks is the currency
this is austin fun raging, not inhumanly stressed out raging
The truelly richest video game character is the player... Because YOU have all that currency to control...
10:34 Austin really be out here making us watch Mario characters collect all coins but one...
2:58 cops, the military should I go on
How does one achieve a 300000 per hour emerald farm?
Did I see Micheal Swaim in the credits!?
so apparently not done video? not like you can't record a voice and make it fast but anyway ... XD
11:15 there is maple syrup, why didn't you just use that?
So.... part 2 Austin?
Steve always has diamonds case closed
Please do a video on which Pok√©mon is the best character to use or card game please also great video I love YouTube channel.
Hey Austin, Who the hell is Lil Hentai? I joined your Discord and saw no signs of you and only a Lil Hentai
You might wanna wait till 1.14 where you can farm emeralds for free
what farming method did you use for emeralds? (alex and steve)
shout more, get me angry! that's what i am here for! enough with this sleepy  chilled Austin!
We want a part 2!

Deep down we all know the girl who says that her house cost like some ridiculous amounts on bells in animal crossing is the richest
Currencies don't have to be a store of value. If that were true, currency wouldn't inflate/deflate. Money is a store of value.
* after watching the bloopers *
Me: Jesus! If you want me to unsubscribe so badly then alright
Also technically, the Minecraft world is infinite so Steve and Alex would be the richest
Steve the richest cuz he has infinite rock maker


Or mayb the courier with 10 luck 100 barter bcuz he can gamble to infinity giving that he has money to do so
I'm guessing Eggman because in sonic unleashed he lost over 100 BILLION dollars without any consequences and also he has the power of the chaos emeralds and an army
Sonic, he has lots of rings made of GOLD
Series 1-1: Austin Insanity
Well Luigi is still a millionaire
I'm guessing you missed Gaspar/Shiloh. Let's see...
When you learn more about Economics in a Game Theory video than in any actual Economic classes. XD
For Luigi you should have used the shops from Mario Odyssey...
Wasn't Steve/Alex a god?
Wow.
I am watching this on my phone while I poop...
How did you know?
"No one works for 24 hours", yes, and no one can eat the feathers of a hawk and not only not get sick, but also somehow cure every disease they already had.  Or punch a tree down in a matter of minutes.
Also, you said 50 characters, and that you got through 7, but I count 6 entries.  I guess you're counting Steve and Alex as 2 characters, even though they have 1 entry.  Not complaining, just clarifying.  You're already doing a lot.
WhAt about Pok√©mon?  Professor oak is laundering money by smuggling illegal Pok√©mon. edit: keep asking questions
You never mentioned bells! The superior currency of Animal Crossing!
"We're number one for a few more months!"

@pewdiepie
Scrooge, about being able to swim in gold: "I've worked hard to perfect that skill, building muscles and dexterity."
1:15 I was actually pooping
The classical music behind Austin‚Äôs videos just make them 10x more entertaining and hilarious
What about Frisk and the whole temmie flakes business?
I wood watch a 90 minute video on the richest video game character ever.
For Minecraft, what about transferring emerald-backed currency to ingots of gold? Would that be worth more or less than bread/cookies?
But that's just a theory.. a Wahoo Theory! Thanks for plumbing!
Oh plz we allll know it‚Äôs reaper from overwatch with infinite golden guns
When will part 2 come out ;-;
It occurs to me that based on the video by Austin detailing the economic ramifications of the fastest farming method in Pokemon someone could preempt his calculations regarding the Pokemon protagonist.
Steve, and Alex can buy diamonds.
The time scale for Animal Crossing is 1:1






I helped with a theory yay
Here‚Äôs a video idea for you: how much damage could a creeper explosion do compared to a grenade?
Link, from Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask, can literaly have na infinite amount of money. He can keep living the same 3 days and colecting money and depositing it on the bank (for some reason you dont lose the money you deposit when you go back in time).
fastest way in becoming a crafter in FFXIV...
Is there anymore of this. Like a part 2
COOKIE CLICKER
I mean really you can get 999.99 NaN cookies i've done it
Hey Austin you forgot butark and redmond Mann fro on tf2
To be honest Idk I normally skip the credits
I do hope the MapleStory protagonist is on that list, they make bank man
"I can taste the tide pods already"

My guts says Shepard from the FIRST Mass Effect is the richest guy because it is soooo easy to earn credits and buy super top of the line weaponry with it. As a level 60 Shepard you can get 1000000 creds in a single mission.

Having a massive automated wheat farm would be more effective than farming emeralds. (automated in that you let water harvest the crops)
I feel like Bayonetta's Halo currency would be interesting to see its worth irl
Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars...uses Cymbals...

MAPLE SYRUP IS ONSCREEN!!!!
I bet No.1 is the adventure capitalist guy.
Can we get a "The SCIENCE of" for how fast Metro Man from Megamind is? He's shown reading a book and other things in the span of a second or 2! I'd like to know if he's possibly even faster than Flash!
Hey, could someone tell me the song the begins at 14:11 ?
Thanks.
You worked with the SWAIM (Superior Wealth Analysis Intelligence Machine) on this one?  Now this is what it's like when worlds collide!
Austin: super Mario RPG

Me: Oh hes gonna talk about shirts and pants.

Austin:       
Anyone know what the email music is? I've heard it many times before and I'm just now wondering.
In dark souls, a throwing knife cost ten souls. On amazon an average throwing knife cost $10. So one soul = $1.
The fastest farming you can do on NG is 1.45 million souls an hour in the Tomb of the Giants. Do this 40hr a week for 50 years and you would have $131,500,000,000
Here I am... Still waiting on the rest
Am still waiting for part 2
100 coins = 1 up 
I guess Mario purchases imortality
please do a theory on "when the darkness comes" it's free on steam
I actually got Minecraft for the 3DS a week or two ago
@8:51 squinting at screen he really doesn't look like jevil tho
Austin I love your videos please don't change
14:28 Woah Woah Woah, hang on there buddy. Emeralds only come in veins of one. Check your facts.
11:18 - Looking for Real World Items in Mario, literally has Maple Syrup on the screen. Austin: "Only one item. Cymbals"
If EA was a character, it would win
Calculate the banana coins from Donkey Kong
Austin, the Steve and Alex of minecraft can generate an infinite amount of water bottles!
(And when they flip it, it always stands)
I'd watch a 90 minute video of this.
i know he said no cheats but the fill command in minecraft java edition is just so satisfying to use
Where is the second part
This was uploaded on my birthday.
Settings Game Theory Game Theory stop shouting
Kaos from Skylanders that guy has practically unlimited resources somehow
This is gonna be a fun series
Except they aren‚Äôt going faster than our world, we are going slower than theirs
When will this series continue?! D:<
I started this video on the toilet... how'd you know Austin?
1- pewdiepie tuber simulator 9999999999.99 million dollars
in destiny the currency is glimmer, which u seem to have excluded, not sure if that was just cuz ur criteria disqualifying that franchise
Hey..Mario and and Minecraft games..........




Are in the Endgame Now
Ok Austin, it's been over a month, so where's the next episode in this series?
You seemed to imply that all of the math for this series was already done, so what's the hold up?
Symbals cost about 300-500
Uses US Dollars then uses metric measurement for everything else. You what, son?
I‚Äôm gonna make my prediction. It‚ÄôS KiNg DeDEdE!
i really need the part 2 for this
8:06 is the first game to be reviewed, ur welcome
i would say the carector in the forza horizon games you have billons
Motherlode is not a hack, its a Lifestyle.
The richest character is emperor palpatine hands down
I love part series, you should maybe do some more like this?
He forgot bottle caps as currency
I like how you eliminated the cheaty, exploit or glitchy ways of accumulating wealth. If you had to take this into account the top 30 would just be infinity symbols
Austin plays a video game: now what can I break with science today?
Michel Swaim good to see you writing for a better organization. Small Beanian here, and I can recognize a Swaim poop joke a mile away.
Luigi can be played in most Mario games so ya
can you do a video on who would win in a one on one war the galactic republic from star wars or the covenant from halo.
Adsfljksf that ending though XD Fun idea!
Dear every Game Company on Planet Earth.. Mario and Minecraft, let's talk about that
HEY AUSTIN!! I NEED THE SCIENCE OF ANT MAN
But what if steve or alex didnt get currency through mining for Emralds but rather be farmers and grew wheat for a living?
I leave when 7 mins i into the video I still don't know who's the richest video game character...ü§¶
#1 would always be Scrooge McDuck (Played by David Tennent!)
How about Lego Doctor Who? Time is money and he essentially has all time in his hands.
What about Sonic?üëÄ
pls man, we need part two.
16:35 Best... title... EVER!
Wow I'm actually on the toilet good job Austin
I was seriously taking a poop while watching this video...
Estimate xenoverse 2 and Shinobi Strikers Cacs
Dat Mario RPG Maple Syrup though? Why symbals?
As I see the blue text, and see what I'll get lost in.
I hear him scream "Hey, it's me! Austin!"
Rockstar Freddy. 5 Fazcoins ez from every time he asks, or you die, pretty greedy
Good job on being #2 on trending for gaming!!! Keep up the AMAZING work!!!!
What about Marcus from watchdogs2?
Arn't there also bills in Luigi's Manson?
IT ALSO HAD MAPLE SYRUP MARIO RPG HAD MAPLE SYRUP!!!
what about the diamonds in luigi's mansion?
Adventure Capitalist? The nameless dude for a mascot. What about him?
I think that it's the guy from adventure caplilist
Why playtime her real name

Handsome jack and scroidge mc duck are trillionares and are high up.

Sitting here at 2100 hours/year thinking, dang, the food industry sucks...
Adventure capitalist man, obviously
I think it's actually Lego Tony Stark.
So excited to see Michael Swaim (as in Cracked‚Äôs Michael Swaim,) contributing to this channel
Every mobile game with in-game purchases... so about everyone of them.
1:53 Rich people don't get rich by working long hours though Austin ;'D
Why didn't you use maple syrup instead of cymbals?
R.I.P the sequel
Watch matpats how much is diamond armor costs
Every Meowth in the world because that can literally generate money from thin air
Cool! What about a The SCIENCE of on SCP: Containment Breach
When you realise villagers rip you off making the value you counted mean nothing
so i‚Äôm guessing this was discontinued
you can turn 4 diamonds into 1 emerald in minecraft which is 1 minecraftplex divided by 4 which is probably a lot
I would have loved a 90 min vid from ya dude
I love Austin so much üòÇ
Need more of this\
(this is before video)I bet a stack of gold and my diamond sword it's Steve
Mario collects a lot of money but it goes to Peach who then gives it to Bowser who then uses it to build castles and evil contraptions. Peach gives him the money as a reparation for invading and stealing his country.

(Gasp)
Did I just do a theory?
2:11 What's the background music called?

Hey amazing vid what about selling things other than what is listed
Halo master chief collection xbox/pc is very popular
then minecraft update the currency into coins LOL.
He called me out for being on the toilet >.>
money names in games:
45% credit
45% G
10% everything else
100%üí∏
Luigi video was already that long ago wow!
This is great and all, but I wonder how Mario and Luigi's nets would change using other items. In Bowser Jr's Journey, you can buy mushrooms, syrup - heck, even cheese - for coins.
i wish i was the Sims 4 protagonist instead
If you were to include the game Warframe (by Digital Extremes) it would have been at the top!!!

1. Every day/night cycle on Earth is 4h (8h in total) and the warframes never get tired so they can work all day
2. You can apply enough boosters and buffs that a single 125K credits can become 8M credits
3. We maximize our gear for speed runs
4. We can get 125k in every 5min if done correctly and maximum efficiency
5. (25k/min+buffs+boosters)*240=1920M/(day+night)cycle=700800M/year(in game)
1:02 Hamilton intensifies
There is also the clicker heroes protagonist who literally has 10e100+ dollars
You forgot souls in the gaminc currency wheel
Only 82 hours on Skyrim?
sonic cuz every level he can get loads of gold rings and sell them for cash( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
How did you know I was in the toilet while watching your videos, I literally didn't expect it to happen
GOLD IS AN ACTUAL CURRENCY IN MINECRAFT THAT CAN BE USED FOR TRADES
I do things 24/7 XD
I feel attacked. I sat on the toilet and got out my phone to watch this and you singled people like me out.
Steve can buy a diamond chest plate for 24 emeralds. That means each diamond is worth about 3 dollars. Now do the math.
Skyrim should've used the cost of a horse during pre-car times, then adjusted for today's money.
14:29 Wait. That's illegal
Villager wins. As far as I know, the ATM in New Leaf can hold up to 9,999,999,999 bells.
Well actually to be fair you should have judged Steve by his produce rate cuz the dude can pump out chickens like a poultry demon and I'm also P'sure poptatoes and carrots are worth more than flour IRL
Please please please please Please please please please Please please please please 
PLEASE
Do a destiny video
My life depends on it
11:44 
lol Molow looks like Obelisk from the Astrix series XD
promise tommorow topic austin where is that vid
Addicted to Tide Pods!
F**** what is this the year 2018
This is actually a trick question. The actual richest video game character is Mario‚Äôs brother: Green Mario.
The happened to this "series"
for Minecraft villagers are ripoffs so that isn't accurate
You used symbols, but I saw work pants and maple syrup in those shops too. You did have quite a few choices
Creates 2 part video where the 1st video is 20minutes long, promising the next part the day after... 3 days later
Haven‚Äôt been this early since I was in the womb
3:49

hmm
It‚Äôs the adventure capitalist guy
I felt heavily insulted at that Chicago suburb joke for Fallout 4. My house costs a lot...
I wonder how your character in Terraria would manage in this.
Since bananas are sold per pound, you'll need to figure out the average price per pound that they are sold where ever you decide to focus on.  Then you need to figure out the average weight of a cluster of bananas and the average number of bananas per cluster and divide the former by the latter.  Finally, you multiply the average price per pound times the average weight of one banana.  Et voila!
Luigi is part of some mario games too. NOT just Luigi's mansion. That would make him a bit richer then before, thus your calculation incorrect and rushed
okay of all the references to pick up in this episode I did not expect to see count duckula.
11:50 what about maple syrup?  it exists IRL, does it not have a consistent price in game?
I see why he went with "you can't eat it, you can't live in it", but the flaw he was trying to avoid still exists. The relative value of a potato in skyrim might be the same in that it fills your stomach the same amount, but the amount of labor required to produce one is still presumably higher in their underdeveloped world. Also he went ahead and started with this "lifetime doing the same work" idea but then only counts Luigi's exploits in one game, and Mario's total coin value through main series games to date, ignoring games with farmable coins like the RPGs or Mario Party, etc.
Still entertaining though, I'll give it that.
Austin: "I don't have a plan!"
Also Austin: Wrote the script before recording


I love you Austin.
1:14 are you stalking me, Austin?
i don't need to atch the video, i saw rthe one on steve holding multiple realities and running with that
To determine the value of Mario's coins I always used the Hot Dog stand in Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. One Hot Dog costs 10 coins, so determining what value a coin is should be easy.
Where the part 2
I have an idea for a theory.

How does mario ground pound because while jumping up he goes into a siting position, then is able to go faster than going down and he breaks bare bricks with his butt, and how is butt/spine not broken

Edit: omg I have never had so many likes, thanks
I subscribed because he said ‚Äúcelsius‚Äû
Love to Michael Swaim!
Easily Michael from gta
Still waiting patiently for part 2
Obviously Steve because of all the diamonds he has
Edit: Ooofff 14:28
Waiting for the rest of the series!  :/ let it come soon :D
1:58 Wait, I remember playing that game!
This is flawed in so many ways, it's pretty impressive.
What's less impressive is that it means we're going to have to deal with a bunch more of these videos that have little "science" in them as no, yelling long numbers doesn't constitutes "science".
Definitely not looking forward for these videos.
i totally thought you were going for maple syrup.
I wonder how rich Shovel Knight and Chibi Robo would be in real life. Also The Donkey Kong world does have an actual money currency, the banana coins.
it‚Äôs obviously every character from every mobile idle game ever
If Steve/Alex made a super efficient wheat farm with crazy Redstone then they could get a lot more emeralds from that villager than by mining them themselves, this may affect Steve's/Alex's position in the rankings, Thanks.
UMMMM? So Canada would like a word, because you can definitely drink, eat, and sustain yourself on Maple Syrup. 11:25
The fact that minecraft worlds are infinite so it would be #1 exactly, but good things we're limiting this
My bet is on one of the clicker games, like the capitalist clicker or whatever it was called.
it took me so long to find that one frame at 3:49
for Luigi it seems only luigis mansion was counted. . . when he also ran around in the mario bros games? shouldn't he be higher then his brother?
Where. Is. Part. 2
if use optifine for minecraft it fixes game balance and stops crashes and makes it look so pretty ^^
This channel is very content rich
Debunking matpat is the best part of this XD
The Courier who Broke the Bank:
Get kicked out of every casino for winning too much.
I would greatly appreciate it if you ask him thx
Matpat vs Austin for the grand title of 'King of the Video Game Mathematicians'
waits patiently for a theory on series of unfortunate events
When you say "the economy of fall out has been completely decimated" at 9:51 do you mean literally cut by one 10th, or are you trying to say obliterated?
2 part please
My favorite game enter the gungeon 
Well I think it‚Äôs the litch in bullet hell because every time in gun lore once a bullet dies some shells goes to bullet hell and the litch keeps it honestly the bullets you kill in this game is so much that the numbers can overwhelm you that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm putting this here ;3
It‚Äôs been a month
Where is part 2
The Game Theorists channel is like a hotel and Austin is just that type of guy that shows up there sometimes to sleep even though he has his own house (YT Channel)
You should include the race car drivers from the Forza games. They probably are number 1.
There better be Lego games and animal Crossing
I would have watched that 90 min video :3 Eagerly awaiting the series!!! WHOOOO!!!
why not use the real life comparisons for the mushrooms in Mario
Alex/Steve could earn a lot more due to automatic machines but still probably wouldn‚Äôt reach those trillions you were talking about
Where is part 2?
Austin just gave me my plan for what to do with my body after I die
The Forza Horizon Drivers Duh
Truck drivers work 24/7. I eat and sleep at work for weeks to months before I get to go home.
How did he know i was sitting on the toilet and why is my comment Nr. 2019
Well I know who is the richest it‚Äôs the adventure capitalist guy/girl.some people say that it‚Äôs a mobile game but it‚Äôs on ps4
So what happened to this not-quite-a-series-yet?
Thailand still trade Gold btw. Not so surprise seeing current government [not relevant, i just here to trash talk junta ]
You show us a screen containing maple syrup and you choose symbols
For the Mario coins couldn‚Äôt you have also used the maple syrup as a reference?
Hey Austin ! We need the next episode of this please ( Õ°$ Õú ñ Õ°$).
A question for later . . . which of Crypto's weapons from the Destroy all Humans games, is the most dangerous?
im looking forward to the series
Come on Austin where is part 2?
Hey you should do portal ‚Äúboth of them‚Äù specifically aperture laboratories since it‚Äôs only owned by GLaDOs

Edit:Oh my goodness that‚Äôs a lot of likes
You could also do a video on the poorest character
Waiting for part 2-150
shouldn't Luigi get all the coins from the Mario games where he plays player 2 as well why is mansion the only game that got counted
I wonder how well the runescape protagonist compares to the people on his list.
3:44 (throws my computer out the window)
I place my bets on the Terraria Protagonist.
3:04 Pew Research Center...




._.
Who else watched this on the toiletüòÇ
obviously luigi....
0:48
My bet is steve from minecraft 
14:32
....OK, im with princess peach now..
...or mario...lets go mario
LATER
OK time to wait for next eopisode, mate
Scrooge/Drac? Been done.
Make a part 2 so you are not..... nuts
I just want to see how animal crossing chalks up
With Minecraft what if you use the value of a real life 250g emerald?
I think the animal crossing villager will be the richest.
That better have been a Good Charlote refrence
how dare you! you forgot Ed from Tonic Trouble! ad I can't even unsubscribe because this channel is The Game Theorists in general. damn! you got me!
make abot roblox pls
Well done Austin, you have eliminated the ability to do individual videos on all of these characters.
Wait doesn‚Äôt the shop sell maple syrup
I wanna guess that nr.1 is the guy from No Man's Sky
Kris Is an anagram forma frisk without the f the f means freedom AND frisk without the f means risk Kris has to do a risk for His freedom the risk of all people fall in war AND dont remember him AND His soul became vas AND became charA
Hay Austin I wanted to know how screwed would Montana ( and the surrounding states) be after the ending of farcry 5 ?
How about the Terrarian protagonist from Terraria, they use gold, copper, silver, and platinum to purchase a bunch of real world items from NPCs.
1:38 SCP Foundation be like
I think there's something you forgot to calculate. you've found the size of planets for some of these games, and they're not the same as earth. Which means that the hours worked should be modified between them.
You didnt include spyro?
In Minecraft if you trade something same couple times the villager no longer offer a trade, because it is "overbought". You must trade some other things also.
also,  You can build in survival minecraft very efficient cookie farm, and in 50 years you can make it so big and efficient that Minecraft should be number one :D
When I saw this video I thought he meant which video game character was WORTH the most not which video game character is richest in game
Using the Mario coin analogy the suit in Odyssey would be about 16.6 dollars
when's part 2,3,4,5, and 6
you for got maple syrup is also in both the Mario shop and real life but hey
/gamemode c, its not aa hack because mojang intends for you to use it since by typing as much as / will give you a list of commands 1.13+ steve/alex would be first place in creative mode.
What about the characters from Payday 1 and 2?
 They rob banks for a living.
i place my bets in beatrix labeau
ahh hamilton refereces
I know you may not see this but can you do a fortnite story/ The science!! Theory because season 8 is thrilling and I really think there‚Äôs something behind it because there are SO many references of keys and other things and another thing is how they only have to hold out a map thing and can build ALMOST ANYTHING. Also zip lines have magnets üß≤ hooked to our head when we go on it, also when we get eliminated a robot drone comes out of nowhere and scan us back to the lobby.
that mash up between dracula and a duck already exists!!! its called count duckula!!! educate yourself!!
What if you set up an auto steak farm in Minecraft?
wheres the second part?
I bet the Pokemon protagonist is the most rich game character because of how much money you can get, and the timescale is actually the same as real life's
Uhh, maple syrup also exists in the rpg...
its the forza people in forza 4, 14,000 cr for a 64,000$ car, thats 1/4 ratio, so unlimited is unlimitedx4
Here's a character list for those who got lost
1. Sims 4 protag
2. Steve and alex
3. Dovakhin
4. Mario
5. Luigi
6. Fallout 4 protag
Don‚Äôt give up, skeleton!
Dude, every day for my Sim, she collects over 20,000 dollars from GARDENING.  And that's from having 35 plants above the quality of normal or nice.
This video drags
Steve and Alex aren‚Äôt worth 44mil, villagers just have really crappy trades.
Wait, Mario rpg has maple syrup, which you can eat. As well as other food items. Why were cymbals used?
also emeralds arent on average 20 wheat ,the villagers just SOMETIMES offer that much
We‚Äôd watch a 90 hour video of you or MatPat. (Not all in one day because that‚Äôs literally impossible, but we‚Äôd come back until we managed to finish.) You guys know over 11M people watch this stuff for you guys all the time.
THE POINT IS... When‚Äôs part 2? :)
Where is the next episode at
I think Terraria's protagonist is in the top 10
This video doesn‚Äôt work unless u compare 1 item consistently. U assume that each item's value is consistent with real world value but this doesn‚Äôt work as u do not account for relative demand and supply with would change the value. 1 bottle of water in fallout 4 could buy u 1 pair of cymbals but that doesn‚Äôt mean that in mario a pair of cymbals could be exchanged for 1 bottle of water

Edit:A better way of doing it would be to calculate the cost of living and divide total earnings by that
You can just see how much a banana cost today and then by estimating how many the guy have you can multiply the cost to the whole number giving you the close number you need
Fire Emblem anyone?
Pfft , the richest charter is obviously  Nicole watterson from spongebob
pls make a thory abot roblox
If you didn't play Minecraft you didn't have a true childhood
Did Tom Nook make it to the top 50?
just make a big video, we‚Äôll watch it like come on dude
Im 7 minutes in, when does the actual video start?
Do an other one
I love how you keep trying to drink everything. Symbols potatoes.
Part 2?
I have a question. eer, How does Mario's groundstomp work? or, any characters ground stomp for htat matter.
Still waiting on a second episode.
I wanted a 90 minute episode
I can eat gold doesn't mean I'll digest it though
I can live in gold but I can't afford it lol üòÇ

We neeed the second one
7:19 South Africa Krugerrand
Austin where are the other parts
honestly your ways of calculating how Steve makes money is really silly since you can just make a hell lot of automatique farms and trade with villages making millions of emerald
uses creative mode
Honestly, I was not expecting the sims characters to be on this list at all. So seeing the sims on here really shocked me. Who else agrees?
Wait so maple syrup was right there
I got prealbra because of you thank you so much
Theres been characters with god like powers and omipotence. How does that work?
it¬¥s funny the basic ideo of the bottlecaps were as a replacment for water
Alright who TF is this guy... is he replacing Mat Pat??
Do Link vs Pokemon  next.
Matt pat
The richest one is Tetris.
It's clearly Steve, I mean he has creative mode that gives access to any material in the universe.
credits are no good here you need something more real
the most efficient way to get emeralds is with a farmetr and pumpkin and mellon farms (automated) and to use them to produce infinet emeralds
My ears!!!!!!!!!
Who even mines emeralds, there are fully automated farms so you can trade with a farmer for MUCH MORE emeralds than just mining them

So technically, Steve/Alex can farm as much emeralds as the computer they live in allows before it breaks from all the full-auto farms

Basing them on one of the cheapest trades (also .01*20=.116) does not make sense.

there are pieces of armor (leather, iron and chainmail), there's gold, lapis, and even diamonds that can show you how much more an emerald can be worth.
Even basing it on pumpkins/ melons/ raw meat makes much more sense, since there's an immediate real world equivalent, and makes emeralds worth much more.
now basing them on diamonds will probably make Steve\Alex num.1, so im thinking that basing them on pumpkins or melons will be more correct (plus you don't know if he uses the wheat effectively, so in crafting there might be a big loss of flour per wheat)

Also, think about it logically, how can an ore that's much rarer than diamonds, be worth less than a quarter?
Club penguin better be in this!
Wait a sec.....was that Harry Potter and the Railway Tycoon?
Where the next episode
No ''part 1'' in the title. I am disappointed.
I mean Mario has multiple lives. (And according to game theory it means that the galaxy is being being reborn) I think that he hit the jackpot
some geologist work 24 hour so yeah
Dude a mini series will be awesome
Do cyberpunk 2077
Symbols? But I saw maple syrup...
In Minecraft, one can produce pumpkins at a massive rate.  Given a low estimate of $5 per pumpkin, and one can easily produce 800 pumpkins per IRL hour, or 3 in-game days.

800 pumpkins / 3 in-game days * 365 days / year * 50 years * $5 / pumpkin = $24333333.33.

$24 333 333.

You said $44,000,000.

Remember that I said a small farm?  We can effectively triple the height, and put about 4 in each of ~150 active chunks, making 24 million * 4 * 3 * 140 = 40880000000.

40 880 000 000.

It's still not much in the grand scheme of things, but it's almost a thousand times your estimate.
Your videos are the best... This channel is not worthy.

what about the game Egg Inc.
I have money on the protagonist of Stardew Valley being high up on the list. Usually, the player spends a majority on their gold on seeds, fertilizer, furniture, house upgrades, etc etc., and players can make bank quick in areas like the Skull Cavern. If the Stardew Valley protagonist is actually #1, I will laugh myself to sleep.

As my main man Jello said "if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard do I have to punch a chicken to cook it." That made me wonder can any video game characters cook a chicken by punching it? IE Captain Falcon with Falcon Punch.

you got something wrong in the video: gold is not the best conductor of electricity, is under copper.
The list is like this:
1. Graphene
2. Silver
3. Copper
4. Gold
5. Aluminum
Actually Minecraft Steve would have a net worth of over $67,241,542,830 because of melon farming
1:23 is that a Ubisoft Toilet??
You used potatoes as a form of "currency" when you estimated how rich the Dovahkiin was/is. At the end of the "episode" you said "Go earn those potatoes!".
Guess what I was about to launch while you said that
That's right. You made me a bit paranoid for a second there
I think the heavy from tf2 should be here

You forgot that coins respawn. In Mario Odyssey the most efficient farming method (that I know of) is in Bowsers Kingdom on the side roof of a medium level. You can grow a vine, get up it and just not press any direction, throw cappy out and grab the boost flower to get a LOT of coin in a quick time. In less than an hour you can reach the max
For finding the value of coins, couldn't you have also used the shop in Mario Odyssey? You could have used either the price of clothes, or the price of a power moon, and since in a previous video you guys figured out how much power each one gives, you could use that to determine the worth.
the richest character is goodman
I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with some of these, especially the Minecraft one, but you do you
When do we get the next episode?
I have one problem with the way you're doing this. You said you were comparing it to US dollars which is understandable but the problem with that is 1 ounce or gold = a specific amount of US dollars and a 1 bottle cap = a fraction of a penny.
Essentially I don't like how it doesn't count in how the currency works in the economy.
For example since a house can be bought in the largest city of Fallout 4 at its downtown area for only 2000 caps, caps are obviously a better currency compared to dollars.
I hope subnauticas protagonist is in this cause at the end of the game it says you gathered 3 trillion credits worth of materials
MAT PAT! PLEASE! MAKE A THEORY ON THE GAME DEVOTION! PLEASE!
Okay dont tell me he wouldnt take god of war into consideration

World of Warcraft  is 1 Hour different from  Michigan.
Wait...Austin are you referring to your own Discord server in which case CAN I HAVE THE LINK or are you referring to the Game Theorist Discord server?
Where is world of warcraft
Roblox is who im saying
you are mental
You forgot the currencies of "Munny", "Brownie Points", "Gil", and probably some others. That is some poor research there.....

Just joking btw, you did a great video and I know you can't possible list all fictional currencies in a video. I don't even think it is possible to list all currently used currencies on Earth and fictional currencies probably outnumber Earth's currencies by more multitudes than I could calculate.
I loved seeing a fellow believer in gold being a fiat currency.  And then you argued as to why gold's historic  value is different from the inherent value of a non-corrosive highly conductive easily workable metal that can be used for Electronics.  üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç I always wonder how much of gold's value is tradition and the religious significance of a metal that doesn't tarnish representing immortality. ü§î Gold has been used across all cultures at one time or another  in royal crowns, religious ritual instruments, coins, contracts and marriage to represent divine immortality of a ruler or religion, an immortal government, an immortal contract or the everlasting bonds of marriage. I've never really believed symbolism has a predictable constant value.
I would argue Mario simply because Minecraft has no infrastructure.
I hate multi part series. Especially when not all episodes are available. That's like watching TV a few years/decades ago. No wonder I stopped watching TV all along. :) Great vid so far :P
I really don't like the Minecraft math. It is generally known that Villagers are huge scammers. I would value trough gold or iron in that case.
For Minecraft, Creative Mode exists!
My moneys on Poptropica or the person that didn‚Äôt use the wrist strap
Wait maple syrup doesn‚Äôt exist
um, pumpkin trading Minecraft? average pumpkin sale is 16 dollars, then average trading is 11 pumpkins for one emerald which means:
11 x 16 = 176.00 US dollars, so
IN that case, one emerald is 176 dollars,
1,811hrs a year, times 50 years is 90,550
AND Then we have as you said 300,000 emeralds per hour
and 300,000 x 90,550 =27,165,000,000  Which is a lot of emeralds, you said there were 377,000,000 emeralds, which would mean you would have 1256 hrs of emeralds, then 27,165,000,000 x 176 = 4,781,040,000,000 dollars, or in other word 4.78 TRILLION dollars.

Walks in with CK2 and EU4 with owning the world and having built as tall as possible by the end game (last 50 years of the game) which 1 character is only required (if your lucky) therefor coinciding inflation their profits could be huge
Is the character with the biggest lifetime earning really the richest charakter? Being rich more depends on the money that you currently own imo, which could just come from a big heritage. Or potentially a character could simply always instantly spend his money and can we really call someone rich, who currently doesn't have any money?
Maybe I'm getting philosophical here, idk.
My lad Ezio from AC brotherhood better be in there.
Congrats on trending Austin, you‚Äôre finally once out of Mat‚Äôs shadow.
11:20 - wouldn't the maple syrup that was in the shops have made a better analogue, as cymbals these days are mass produced, with advanced machinery, which that game did not appear to have, whereas maple syrup is something which I doubt will have changed much over time, as it's always going to have to be harvested the same.
For FO4 guy, first, you should have scaled the value of currency in Uganda to the us, which you did not, and second, the amount of water varies depending on how many water purifiers you can build. You could possibly have so much more if you calculated all the surface area of water available in all settlements  divided that by the the space one industrial water purifier takes up. Also, surface area of dirt in all settlements divided by area taken up by powered water pump (dlc)
Hey it's me....... AUSTINNNN
This boi has a TikTok
no its the cookie clicker guy cuz you can get infinite cookies it takes a while but cookies is the in game currency.

6:44 does anyone know what game this is?
who even eats potatoe.
in kurwanistan we drink the potatoe juice.
The real sad thing in the research for the emerald's value is, that the amount of both input and output can vary.
A mending book is the most expensive item on a multiplayer server with 40 emeralds per book as it's starting price, while the villager itself can do it between around 9 up to 30 emeralds.
Sometimes the villager trades 20 wheat for an emerald, sometimes it does 14, sometimes it does 11, sometimes 30, it varies and you took only one instance instead of the average, or you took the average and didn't mention it. Basically, you made a little mistake there, that germans don't do, as we always check if something cheaper of the exact same thing exists before buying.
wait but in super mario rpg has maple syrup
11:24

Did you compare the size of Mario vs the cymbals??? Kinda look big. Maple syrup I saw was a buyable item. That might be a more accurate number, but could be wrong. I think your math needs a little bit of a redoing.

i hope Arthur morgan is in the list
Well let's be honest, villagers in Minecraft have STUPID, and unfair trades. I don't blame you and do not expect you to calculate it again, but the villagers have different trades (that will be much more fair to the player) in the next update, so the results will be different pretty soon for Steve/Alex.
Holy crap how did he know I was a dump while watching this

You can make much more in the sims if you clone Ambrosia and sell it.
fortune enchant should count
TL;DR: Fallout 4's protagonist should be way richer. Water is worth more than that. It is a good idea, although it's more work, to look at more than one kind of trade goods to define the value of something. 1 bottle of water is 20 caps, but what's that compared to the rest of the stuff you need?


Valuing an Ugandan bottle of water at .28 USD seems a little far fetched. If it is such a valuable commodity there, I would assume that the price, adjusted for inflation and the consumers' puchasing power, should be waay up there. In Norway, where we can get better water by strolling to the nearest stream than with store bought water (not shitting on bottled water's parade, just saying Norwegian water is generally good quality and plentiful at that), a 700ml bottle of regular water costs at least 2 USD, although if you adjust for purchasing power, that number gets smaller. The economy in Fallout 4 seems to be doing relatively good, and with clean water being such a valuable commodity, I see no reason to value a bottle og potable water at such a low price.

The answer has to be Mario because of Mario maker
Erhm... Luigi... Did you even watch the episode MatPat did? Because he calculated it to be $500M.
So..., maybe check your calculations and watch how he did it before you confirm the $1M.
Edit: Also, he added in the other junk that was in the original mansion before buying a NEW mansion at the end of the game.

What if MatPat pins this?
Actually link
Link and Minecraft steve  have infinite  resores
Isn't purchasing power comparable within only one universe though? Steve can purchase a certain amount of wheat with one emerald. But is that amount of wheat worth for him as a human as much as it is in real life? Can he sustain himself with said wheat as long as a human can with the same amount? What I'm trying to say is that the products you use to compare purchasing power are not equally useful for sustaining a human (and therefore are not worth equally much) in every universe.
I wonder how much a slime rancher makes...
Has anyone thought about supermariomaker? Mario can literaly just spawn in coins

It's legitimate -.-
Eh, not considering a spinoff title like Fallout 76 makes sense. Stick to the main games, the newest being Fallout 4. Can't wait until they announce Fallout 5.
Potato... FTW !!!
GOOD GOD!!! HOW DARE YOU MENTION TIDE PODS.... I AM REPORTING THIS NOW!!!
Where is the rest of this series????
Can we get a Mario Maker 2 theory when it comes out?
I still think of a bonemeal farm + potato farm could potentially yeild a better net worth. hell even a melon farm would.
Part 2?
Minecraft
Where is the restttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
I don't know if this is on your list but Slime Rancher would be good to add.
But villagers on minecrft are fcking scammers emeralds are not worth 20 wheat
Anyone else get startled when austin called you out on watching while pooping?
14:10 What music/song is that?
Is this mattpat
the moment you realise that alliteration allert also is an alliteration
Where is part 2?
ness undertale is richest
U sound different
Yo Austin why would you consider finding and selling emeralds, the best way for Steve or Alex to gain wealth ? It certainly would be better to directly grow the wheat since the 1 emerald to 20 wheat ratio isn't very favorable. Moreover 3 wheat in a row can make a loaf of bread, which I would argue is more expensive than cookies and very convenient for math since it doesn't involve any cocoa beans.
I‚Äôve just noticed that in the thumbnail if it‚Äôs blue text it‚Äôs Austin and if it‚Äôs green text it‚Äôs matpat.  Try itüòÇ
Biggest earner*. Richest assumes they cannot lose or waste the money and you don't appear to bw counting inheritence.
Where is your sequel dude
Where is MatPat?
Where's the second
Doth I see a Hamilton reference?
Where is the other parts
Do a fnaf game lab but with the king of fnaf markeplire
Where is mattpatt
Matpat PLZ do dark deception
I KNOW MY FAVORITE GAME IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE!!!
Austin: Your game is worth nothing 
Me: ü§£üòÇüòÖü§îü§®üòêüò∂üò•
Tell MatPat to go to fnafworld.com or i'll stop watching you!
Where has Austin been?
Your voice change
13:26 Yes!
Next do the mystery of pathfinder‚Äôs creator
Austin. So in Skyrim SE if you‚Äôre a vampire lord and you use the drain life spell that‚Äôs in your right hand in vampir lord on a dragon skeleton it will literally shoot it up a mountain. I feel like there‚Äôs definetly some terrifying force numbers and like Newton‚Äôs 3rd law stuff that would break arms.
Where's the next
can you put the science part in the front of the title because these are the only videos i watch from this channel and i missed this one because i didint see the science in the tital since it got cut out. now im watching this a few days late.
Nice Hamilton reference. 

Also, how did you know I was watching you that way???
2:58 Missed opertunity for pewdipie joke
Who is still waiting for part 2
0:01 God help us all
Gilgamesh
6:39 he said Gul. Like if you hear it
In luigi's mansion, it's not mario's coins
Oh him? Again?
Hi Austin, I am a percussionist and i can say the average price of a pair of true bronze cymbals is not 70 bucks. That price probably includes singular cymbals and cymbals made of metals other than bronze like brass or lower quality bronze. A staple pair of cymbals is probably closer to $300-$400 and can go up to $1100.
It's Mario DUHHHH
What's the song that starts for Minecraft? Is glorious.
"you cant eat it, you cant live in it, and can only drink it if melted". well far be me to make contender of the year for the next darwin awards, but id have to disagree on the "not being edible or drinkable" parts of some of these currencies. also in regards to fallout, have you BEEN to a hipster art show?
Ash from Pok√©mon.
The moment you said "The Courier", I felt joy inside my soul.
Except that you can earn a lot more caps without using any exploits.
9:45 (voice crack)
Where is the pt 2???
What music is that at the beginning?
Monopoly
You can buy "blue" colored diamond armour with magic on it which honestly makes steve and alex the richest also they can buy blue colored diamonds swords
11:32 Looking for real world objects to scale Mario's economy, preferably items you can wear or eat, with Work Pants and Maple Syrup on the screen, Austin chooses Cymbals. headslap
nah the richest is mario. everytime he return to a level all coins reappear...
Guess what, MINECRAFT IS INFINITE!! No limit on emeralds... limitless money üí∞
Wtf a bottle of water for only $0.28, when we get ripped off, and have to pay like $2.
I have 2.4 million septims in skyrim as well as 75 pounds of gold ingots.
I was originally going to say it's Micheal, Trevor and Franklin from GTA V.  If you save the assassination missions for after the main story and play the stock market with them you can get the  games' maximum amount of money which is some number, which I can't remember exactly, around $2.3 billion. 
Of course since Austin said there were trillionares, I guess it's not them.
what about the algodoo athlete or the roblox noob or the brawl starts characters or the fortnite characters or ...........................
Ninja Fortnite account
Michael Swaim contributed? That wasn't a name I expected to see here.
Me be like 
Where the f is MATPAT ?????????
You should do who‚Äôs the strongest Mortal Kombat character
Actually, i'm not sure if it counts, or would even get up in the list, but the player in general, not an individual character, so more like the account, can get absurd amounts of coins in Bleach Brave Souls. I have played three months and am at 150Mil right now. Some people, the real veterans, played since three entire YEARS, imagine their worth!




Someone tell me if that counts with the rules set by Austin in the beginning of the video, cuz i'm not sure.
You can just use hacks
What about binding of Isaac
steve is the richest.

Creative mode
My list terraria character Scrooge mcduck with Trillin dollar May pat went over that.and the default in fortnite if you take a v buck make that into real money 1000 v bucks equals 10 dollars and 2000 equals 20 more v bucks more dollars
But some resources are rarer in some places then other places
so did you actualy plan that ending or ...
Mini gun in fallout 4
runescape gp
11:32 maple syrup
Where is part two
5:45 I never thought I'd hear ish on this channel
I think Minecraft
I am going to make an argument here. Its Tom Nook. Tom Nook is the richest, most scammiest video game character ever. Argument over. Thanks for listening
What song is in the background
The title of the video is Mario versus Minecraft why the f*** are there other games it should just be Luigi, Mario, Steve and Alex not anybody else you f**** lie to us matpat!
Imagine a Super Mario Battle Royale title. 





Yeah I‚Äôm disgusted at myself for thinking it too.
Where's part 2 ??
Do you do this in your head or do you have a calculator?!?!
???????!
Wow‚Ä¶ look at that face at 7:57
Et for the Atari 

I‚Äôll bet in bloopies
yes let‚Äôs go
I'm beginning to think Austin delights in making these vids that could make his head explode
Handsome Jack?
Where's part two?
I‚Äôm betting that either Payday 2 is going to win or Borderlands 2
villagers
Stop doing limited edition match
Isn‚Äôt Nintendo Eshop Gold is technically the value of Mario coins? which is around 100 coins = $1 give or take I think.

Once more Nintendo games hit smartphones and we get more microtransactions this should help solve the problem.
0:44 forgot meseta
MARIO HAS ENTERED SURVIVAL MODE
I know about Ugandan was Ive been there
What about gems? MatPat calculated that Luigi has 500M

You're welcome.   XD
My Little Pony reference
THERE IS ALSO MAPLE SYRUP IN MARIO RPG!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Um I think Edward from black flag is pretty rich a shot is 20 gold so I want to see his net worth
OOOH I'm actually very interested in this. This is very similar to a project I tried on my own once. I wanted to figure out the exchange rate of currencies between game worlds, and used a health potion as the common purchase. Obviously there are some problems with that I would address if I tried that again now, but at the time it was an intriguing puzzle to unravel. I hope that we could maybe see a breakdown of each currency's value compared to a fixed rate in a chart or something like that at the end of this.
Yeah, I was hoping this would be a series! Does this mean we get more Austin than just once per month?!
And the money he could get and more
Matpat play Danganronpa
Matpat play Danganronpa
Matpat play Danganronpa
Adventure capitalist
Matpat play Danganronpa
yes
Austin, less than 1 minute in & you've already said something controversial with little to no evidence presented to support your assertation. It's not *Barbie*!
Episode 2 plsss
My bet it is the RuneScape, WOW, or Other MMO player.
Austin stop making videos,i want mat pat
were is the next episode?
STEVE I THINK IS THE RICHEST...    P.S. I HAVE NOT WATCHED THE VIDEO YET
SHUT UP ABD TAKE MY RINGS AND MUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!
wait drink potatos vodca!
That mathematical Trillionaire had better be a Caldari Freighter from Eve. Nothing says wealth like buying and selling 465,000 M^3 of precious metals, and harvesting a planet of its resources as a side gig while you make your trade runs, and trading commodities-as-stocks in Jita while waiting for the jump drive to kick on.
I think in order to determine the worth of Banana Coins in Donkey Kong, you have to find the value of the bananas in Donkey Kong first. The reason you should do this is because in Donkey Kong Country Returns when you get 100 bananas you get a red balloon. Then you compared 100 bananas to the amount it cost it coins, run the numbers. And ta da you have the value for banana coins.
I‚Äôm legit sitting on the toilet rn
But Austin with Mario it said that all his coins were collected before Mario oddesey
It said before odyssey
Ya one day later....
Fanf is not over matpat
USA! USA! WE'RE NUMBER ONE FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS!
Steve is the richest because infinite gold blocks = lots of money




Well actually if you have infinite gold blocks the price of gold get cheaper and cheaper the more you pull out, soooo
Where is Matpat?
i want matpat back
In Mario rpg there's madone syrup...I know there are many varieties and whatnot but... IDK you could boil of the MS and get water so I would think it's more valuable, IDK, just saying
What about Mario after odyssey?
When you don‚Äôt know what to comment
Chants "America" then tells us the temperature in celsius.
ONLY ONE ITEM?! 11:26 you couldve done maple syrup!
Pok√©mon
Fortnite enough said...
I am calling it Peach will be high up there
Minecraft
Hold up, Austin, you can't just use a single item to estimate value! You have to use an entire basket of household goods, weighted by the quantity purchased, in order to make an accurate comparison between currencies and therefore incomes. For example, how would you know how much a pair of symbols is worth in Mario compared to real life? Perhaps cymbals are in massive demand, giving them an incredibly large price tag and maybe making them a major cause of inflation in the mushroom kingdom!
Where is episode 2?
One month has passed
You need to watch lots of fun it can help your theory fanf
you forgot to account for the fact that some games inherently require you to spend a lot more many than others; so like in mario you can save up your money more easily than in a game like sims or something idk
What happened to Mat?
Got a buck on Bruce Wayne
Wait! I got it! Stardew Valley has seasons. Each season has about 28 days. That's less than a third of seasons on Earth! So how fast does the world of Stardew Valley have to be going around the sun to make that possible? Maybe you can also find how fast the world has to be revolving to go through a day as fast as it does. Yeah it has a clock in the corner, but the day goes by in less than an hour, so the world has to be spinning very fast
Why is it this guy instead of matpat
Where‚Äôs part 2
If you look at the thumbnail of this video it clearly says ‚Äòwho makin‚Äô bank‚Äô am I the only one who noticed.
hey you forgot that some one made a shugar cane farm in minecraft making paper seling it to viligers and making about 35 000 emerald blocks/h
The one dude in warframe who runs the index: endurance has like ‚ôæ to 9999999999999999999999999999999 credits. (Not infinite but no1 has reached the end)
I bet Minecraft will win.

Ok.... this was 3 weeks ago.... where is the rest?
I'm just thinking here how much money the protagonists of Watch_Dogs can... totally legitimate earn... with hard working walking pressing buttons in their cellphones.
Why can‚Äôt it only be Matt patt!
Hate the thumbnail
What about fallout characters with full gold bars?
Where are the next videos?
Sonic
Yeah um about the donkey kong bananas, maybe you could find that out with the mario+rabbids kingdem battle dlc where bananas are used to buy gear rather than mario coins?
Sonic
What about Village of Foreman
It's a method of using Village to get a bunch of and emeralds
Hey there Game Theory. Listen, I am really confused about something. The last game in The Legend Of Spyro (Dawn Of The Dragon) was left on a HUGE cliffhanger! Can you please do a Theory about this? I‚Äôm not looking for likes or hearts, I just need some understanding.
I know its minecraft
where is matpat
I have never felt more attacked by a video than I did at 1:13
1:01 - oh look it‚Äôs a Hamilton reference
where is matpat
3:49
How did talking about Mandy turn into someone being on the toilet eating tide pods and getting in a washing machine ?
Inflation?
Do a theory on smoke‚Äôs canister from rainbow six siege.
Austin I was thinking about your Tracer video for like 3 minutes and   I think you were thinking about it wrong what if shes not geting the stats of the past but the stats of the future ok I know what you're thinking this is an old video and whos ganna read it and the Tracer video was like 500 years ago but I dont give any craps about that anywho so what if her accelerator actually records her position and the only valid position she can go back to was 10 seconds ago and forward. and eveytime she jumps through time it stores data on the condition she was in or would of been in if she hadn't jumped so when she recoiled it would revers her momentome and the movements she made up to 10 seconds while accelerating her healing with data it had on her heath but do to the reversal of 10 seconds it can only accelerat her healing to the state she was in 10 seconds before which would explain why time only seems to move back for her shes not going back its only making it seem like she is and the reason it puts her back like thats is becuse it would most generally be safer their than where she was so please tell me if you read this or found it interesting 

sincerely,
Crazy
Where is virtual beger
It‚Äôs Minecraft I can make the whole world diamonds or gold if I want
we want matpat!
3:48 I...dont think we're number one. Er lost that a year or two ago (and it's partially my fault. SORRY!)
USA! USA! WERE NUMBER ONE FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS!
not matpat
That guy who runs the battle bus,he must make literal millions
Yessssss, an Austin video mwahahaaaa
MatPat made it. Recheck old videos and math next time?
My bet is red dead redemption 2
Where is the mini series
In the rpg menu, I saw maple syrup for sale...
So you're telling maple syrup is not real
11:32 Literally shows "Maple Syrup" on screen as an item... doesn't consider it's value
Why is the first character that I thought of when I clicked on this video was the driver in the Forza driver both on the Motorsport and Horizon series?
Time to rob them all.
I‚Äôm going to be rich! RICH I TELL YOU!
70$ for cymbals? 
Only for very low quality. Cymbals are so expensive ;_; (150$+ each for a good one)
I think that the number one character will be link from botw.
Austin just transcended all his other previous work. Wow
What about the protagonist in stardew valley you can make a lot from skull cavern and farming sweet gem berries and there‚Äôs a lot of things to look at for value of g in that game so they would get on that list at least
Or that‚Äôs coming up
Why couldn't we just get the yearly salary? I feel that is bit more easy to fathom instead of lifetime earnings.
Weegee
Isn't Bruce Wayne technically the most rich since your math of the Scrooge McDuck Batman can last 5-8x longer...plus he's batman?
guys,  the russian mafia might come but the richest man in the world is vladmir putin.
I'm cool with that!
What about Wolfenstein 3D?
That orange haired, blue eyed, angry buffed mothertrucker carried tons of gold on his friccing pockets, so valuable that can even give you +1 life at a certain point.
It's gold and silver, real life money is there
Ok but your checking retirement age. I have seen people at age 70+ that can work/ are strong enough too. Plus most of these characters don't have real jobs so counting the amount of sleep recommend for a person and the average amount of time it takes to eat, take a bath and put on clothing then subtracting it from 24 hours would be a more accurate calculation. I would do it but I have no idea how you do this stuff üòÇüòÇ
Yeah‚Ä¶ Probably for the best, that mods, cheats, and exploits are excluded. Even with just using mods, there's no guarantee that the mod you use isn't terribly broken. And how do you fairly choose what specific mods to research? You can't.

Still‚Ä¶ I think it would be a fun thing to watch a video about trying to figure out how rich a player could possibly get in minecraft with a popular, high tech, mod pack. There are some really silly methods for gaining resources, when mods come into play. Like a species of cow that produces strange fluids in place of milk. Strange fluids such as liquid metals, or even liquid emerald. And there's always some bizarre new synergies to find between mods included in a pack. I've even heard of methods to supposedly store an infinite quantity of a single type of resource. (Though I think there will eventually be technical issues in the world data, when trying to store the number that is used to represent the resource, when it gets into the absurdly high numbers. But I suppose by that point it becomes moot, as inflation will make the resource worthless, anyway.) Watching people do challenges to accumulate as much of a resource in the allotted time as possible, is still fun.
Temmie wins
Gold is a currency here in Venezuela, the jobs don¬¥t give much money so you need to be buying and selling gold and dollars to live moderately well :(
What about legion dalarius or ncr payroll from fallout nv?
But isn‚Äôt it easier to farm wheat than mine emeralds.

What about Super Luigi Galaxy??
10:36 I have, and you haven't? 




Wow, what a weird world
happy merchant song plays in the background
Are you going to continue this series next episode?
The Mario world and our world both have maple syrup, why didn't you do that one
Luigi, obviously.
wait a miniut tho most mario games you can play as Luigi as well so couldn't he get the coins as easily as well?
I guess bell's :)
Y‚Äôall be sleeping on the Tetris blocks
If Austin is running around at the end of his rope, how much would the other end of the rope cost? He seems like he'd make a cute housepet.
What's the song that plays at 14:10
Livestreaming in the sims is actually how you can make the most money. A LOT of money
Am I missing something, or is 1:01 a Hamilton reference?
The richest of the poor. Hey thats me
What song?
I think Red from Pokemon Red will be number 1 because missingno glitch allows you to get infinite amounts of anything in a legit way like without hacks
You forgot the terrarian
3:50
waiiit tho, you didn't account for coins that are able to be earned in mario odyssey?
its frisk from undertale because temmies dog residue
(joke)
Trigger Happy from Skylanders



Boi shoots coins and chucks pots of gold
Nuff said
Destiny doesn‚Äôt have the day/night cycle turned off, you just haven‚Äôt played in Patrol for long enough in one instance! :)
Who saw Austin holding Pls Halp.
What was the method of getting the emeralds for minecraft?
Can u make  a vid where u can react to my videos

hi jelani

Sonic
Rue Factory 4. By the end of the game you have so much money that buying a 2nd home for 198,000,000 is not a big deal.
No Fortnite? If I controlled rewind, I would want Fortnite
When the game listed on the video gives away the answer to the video... or not, I haven't watched through yet.
EDIT: It's been 8 hours and I actually haven't watched to the end.
Austin you forgot that in Luigi's Mansion Luigi collected gems and gold bars
Yep... cymbals.  That was the only thing he could have used.  Honey pots and maple syrup don't exist in this world AT ALL.
steve is the richest cause he has unlimited gold
I LOVE the video and can‚Äôt wait for the next parts, but you can‚Äôt count the coins in Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA) since it was all a dream.
Mario
Mario
I'm gonna go for Minecraft. If that doesn't win then you're wrong.
What about John 117 AKA master chief
Cymbals? Maple Syrup was right there!
As cymbals are a weaponized item, not just musical instruments, you should have compared it to the average price of a rifle.  That would make Luigi much wealthier.
1:13 HOW DID YOU KNOW?
Omg. I just saw Michael Swaim‚Äôs name on this video. If you see this dude, you‚Äôre awesome and I‚Äôm so happy to see you associated with Austin and the Theorists. üíú your comedy man
Jingle my jollies?!
All for the mini series
Who prefers matpat?
We all  know that Riley from Subnatucia is the Richest because of his 100 trillion credits
Ash is richest.

Austin:mentions Uganda
Me:*clicking intensifies*
You can make WAY more than 2k per day in sims 4 atleast with dlc installed
Always love when an Austin video pops up! ‚ò∫
Austin is hands down my favorite person on this channel
I'm currently playing sims 4 and uh... painting was my first sim. Gardening is ridiculously more lucrative. Plant dragon fruit and feel like cheating...
But can't you farm wheat in or any other seed Minecraft?!
I love to cheat my money in games.  lol
did u do battlefront 2?
Whats the music?
Hey Austin, there is a new farming method for emerald farming I the snapshots for Minecraft 1.14
Quote has a billion guns. The end.

This is going to be my favorite series from you I can feel it
YES I MISSED YOU AUSTIN!
Me: I should be working on my online school because I'm behind 

Me to me: Find out what video games make more money.
For Steve and Alex what about emerald farms = infinite cash $$$$$$$
That guy from adventure capitalist
but the Minecraft world is infinite
The mane characters from the Pokemon series
what about the protagonist in subnautica.
Actually, Gaming‚Äôs richest is sadly Fortnite... I long for the day when it‚Äôs finally dead.
Technocally, u can get infinate emaralds, (Minecraft) so i still have my money (haha bad joke) on the minecraft players.
I SAY MARIO IS RICHER
I think its wee gee
Mr. Krabs is richest, case closed.
The answer is obviusly still pokemon.., just use the "pay day" moves all the time..
Cookie clicker: *creeps around the corner*
who is playing fo4 while watching
Austin please! I wanna join your discord server!
I mean.. if you have ever looked at the god of war, kratos- he's the most rich out there. (lol)
I bet 7 bills Venezuelan dollars.
for the luigi one why not use the maple syrup
At time 3:00 you say know one works 24/7, Technically you are right however you are also wrong. Military personnel work 24/7, however we are mandated to have time off, but if a war/conflict/battle happens then that time off goes away. In the military we are required to be ready for combat 24/7, 365 days a year, 366 on leap years. I can't count the number of times I have been called in or woken up(on the ship) to do work or training, I have once been up for 3 days straight because of work. Yes the military is trying to change that, but you can only do so much when you job is to be ready to fight, the enemy doesn't care if you are eating, sleeping, or on your time off. Just FYI.
My Source: I'm in the military.
‚ÄúUSA! USA! We‚Äôre number one! For a few more months!‚Äù
Steve
God I love these videos soooooo much
You need some chill pills your really freakin out here, he- here you know what take mine.
Ok...Sure...Ok.
Yay...
:3
I have a hunch that Kirby will be No. 1 I mean "Great Cave Offensive" am I right? Or am I right wrong-am am I wrong?
Edit: I'm probably wrong...
I'm guessing the answer is Mansa Musa from Crusader Kings 2. Mansa Musa is the richest person in history, so Mansa Musa with L33t skills should be the richest person in video games.

Most of the time I can‚Äôt understand I single word your saying! That‚Äôs why I love this dude! No homo
(Even though I‚Äôm bisexual and etc and at this point I‚Äôm probably freaking you out) but hey, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I like you in general (once again no homo) your mathematical theories, and your personality! You really do decrease the amount of boredom I feel when matpat only does theories in the fnaf category. Also, you should do a theory on bendy and the ink machine involving how many gallons on ink is in Joey drew studios! I‚Äôd love to see a theory like that!üòÅ

I feel like the tenno in warframe are one of the richest protaganists especially if you grind on the index

13:53 Noob! I have around 5300 hours logged in. Been playing daily since launch, 8 years ago.
Um actually, no one actually uses Emeralds for player trading in Minecraft. It's a sandbox, often multiplayer game, and measuring your number with limited single-player mechanics is extremely flawed.

The average minecraft player would probably net less than a million irl dollars because of the efficiency of an average person's time spent. However, a power-player can efficiently "print" both emeralds and diamonds at an astounding rate with semi-automated farms and villager trading. (Edit: Using his own math of 300k emeralds per hour, a slight adjustment of cookies to compasses yields the player 7 billion US dollars over their life. However no power-focused minecraft player leaves just one farm running, or just produces emeralds. I'd estimate in just one irl-year a server like Hermitcraft produces over 10 billion worth of resources.)
Its gonna take like 7 videos to complete this miniseries if he continues the videos at this rate (7 per vid, 50 in total)
Nice reference to it‚Äôs always sunny in Philadelphia
I love your intro music and set up ‚ù§Ô∏è Gets me pumped every time!
All right. Because of this video, I'm unsubscribing.

Yay nice video it was great. Keep on posting more amazing videos
Then again, Minecraft Steve can carry an entire inventory full of gold blocks, plus the left hand, plus gold armor, and if you count a shulker box having the same weight as it‚Äôs contents then he can carry even more gold.
The thing is, items like symbols could be very rare and hard to get in the Mario world. This would make then worth a lot more then the symbols in our world.
My prediction before watching the vid is Luigi thanks to his mansion earnings, especially if you combine both games (and the third in the making)
Lmao I was expecting MatPat to pop up during Austin‚Äôs rant üòÇ
AUSTIN IS SLOWLY COMING BACK TO HIS ROOTS AS A SCREAMER
Ironically pooping while watching 1:10-1:18
What if Steve did it the other way around? Instead of mining emeralds for 50 years and using them to buy wheat, what if Steve spent 50 years growing wheat then selling that off? Pretty sure he'd be able to grow far more wheat then mine emeralds. Wouldn't that make his worth go up?

Bro, currency is nothing, it is not the value for which we exchange goods but the medium by which we exchange goods. You should count everything, especially in minecraft, diamonds, emeralds, gold and coal will probably make Steve much richer. Currency today is not backed by gold, it only has a value because we all believe in its value. Also why are you comparing emeralds to wheat, something that inflates over harvest seasons and famines.

Minecraft with their cringy fan made dlc
Heh, I could have called the minecraft one... considering emeralds are an extremely unstable value system given that they imply such a small amount of wheat is worth all of the wool on a sheep or anywhere from 5 to 10 of the absurdly large diamonds...
What about AdCap?
So fallout is basically Australia
Mario has maple syrup too
How did you guess where I was watching this video.you creep

You definitely need to add some of those Mario game coin totals to Luigi's fortune for the games you can play as Luigi.
YES! AUSTIN IS BACK! Never scare me like that again.
Wow you actually had yakuza in here! First one that came to mind but I'm glad it crossed someone else's too!
Except Luigi is playable in every game on that list at 12:59 (minus 4 of them), so he's richer than Mario.

Fortnite tho...
excuse me where if fortnite on this list
Your so much better than matpat!
Ash and witcher jesssss
OMG I AM THE FIRST TO COMMENT YAS
Hey Matpat and Austin, if you guys are looking for another game with a backstory like fnaf, I would suggest looking into the Don‚Äôt Starve series (Don‚Äôt starve and Don‚Äôt starve together) the games have been out for a while, but a new dlc just came out for it, making it recent enough to talk about. I think that the challenge of deciphering the rich backstory of Don‚Äôt starve would be a challenging task, and several others have tried to find the whole backstory, but for what I know, to no actual conclusion. Hopefully this block of text gets seen, because I really want to know the full story of the Don‚Äôt starve universe.
hey small suggestion but if youre gonna use a real country thats suffering as an example in ur video it would be nice to offer resources to donate to them or charities to supoort. just a thought.
As soon as you mentioned the bathroom I was actually using it
its gonna be sonic. He has waaaaay to many rings. Like where does he put them?"
I feel like the comparison between Mario and Luigi was unfair, Mario had all those games, but Luigi he only used 1 game
Haha Pew research center i dident know he had a new series
My minecraft boi Steve
For Minecraft you didn‚Äôt include the ability to infinitely produce wheat which could then be traded for more emeralds
hey remember your fnaf  Theory will in one of your videos you sied baby funtime foxy  funtime freddy and ballora and baby has her own soul
dammit the one video I was looking forward to and its not matpat hh damn- not saying austins bad or anything, I just really need some matpat rn

No I'm talking about my brother shut up
Real OGs know Mario is the best game ever
Ok I might be wrong about this but think about it, all the Mario games that exist and all the coins that are put in each game. If every time a Mario game comes out and they keep adding more coins wouldn‚Äôt that mean the worth coins in Mario would keep decreasing? The reason I say this is because inflation. When governments decide to print more money that makes the worth of money lower. In super Mario bros 2, the main idea around that game was more coins. If Nintendo kept adding more coins to each Mario games wouldn‚Äôt the Mario world experience inflation making Luigi much less of a millionaire?

In every Minecraft there is a technically infinite amount of emeralds. Also you can sell lots of other things for emerald that might be more expensive, I think gold even.
I love you Austin
Wait spulunky
How did you know I was pooping on the toilet
Minecraft has auto farms so Steve has infinite resources
We're is matpat

7:20 Greenland has a seventh of the world's gold?
Ok ok I think out of mari and Minecraft I choose Bill gates
Oh yeah yeah
Before starting, I vote Steve/Alex from Minecraft. The reason is 2 words: 
Logging.
Industry.
Now before you get confused, remember that tree farming in Minecraft is infinitely renewable. 
How much did that 2x4 cost?
Infinite is infinite, no matter what of.

I suppose that means every character that can renewably farm is also infinitely rich, but I still think austin is gonna go for Steve.
In Minecraft you can actually farm pretty much anything very fast. Let's take for instance potatos there are really fast farms for that and you can make multiple of those running while you are just eating some cookies and riding dolphins. Now just trade with a villager to change those into emeralds and buy something that isn't worth under a dollar and you get rich really easily. Yeehaa! Minecraft wins again!

(also there's creative mode sooo...)

So okay under the assumption that your calculating buying power, by comparing the economy of each video game universe by looking into the commodities equivalent item to our real world commodities, there are a few things that are a tad inaccurate at least just with Mario and Luigi

-Luigi,   Your measurement of Luigi's wealth is not accurate assuming your just going by Luigi's mansion. First off commodities like musical instruments aren't necessarily a commodity you need, and it is a commodity where quality can flux the price. This fact can be completely negligible, as it is hard to find real life equivalent to items, in Mario however your still comparing two different currencies.

The currency in Luigi's mansion is different, they do not have the same imprint in them, like the usual coins we see in Mario, they are of a different mint. They cannot really be equated to the usual Mario coin unfortunately. 

-Mario, you are comparing two different economies, comparably the coins in Mario RPG are collected at a different rate then the ones in the traditional Mario games. They aren't really comparable, as they are in different worlds.
You know that the UK has a better economy than America
4:25 That right there is the richest b*tch in all of video game history. Change my mind.

What about maple syrup?! Bish
Steve would be more rich because he can mine diamonds and in minecraft theres infinite gold and diamonds and emeralds and other stuff
For the Emeralds one, my first thought wasn't the whole wheat thing, it was that why not compare the size of the emerald to real-world emeralds using pixel measurements and then finding out the worth of each emerald through that?

What about all the other Mario games that you could play as Luigi for the entire game? I know that probably would not allow Luigi to pass Mario but it would bring him closer. And for Minecraft cake would have been the better thing to go for over the cookies. It at least has a measurable volume that could be converted back to the dry ingredients. And only using 1 more wheat than the 8 cookies. And with 1 block being a square meter. The cake is 14x14x8 pixels and 1 meter is 16 pixels on a side. I know I am being nit picky, but 8 cookies ... how big are they? Are they the same size as the ones in Cookie Crisp? The average Chocolate Chip? Or are they sheet cookies made in a cake pan? 

Love the videos just felt it was my time to add my 2 cents.

Hey, I have a theory for you.
The game Angels of Death (satsuriku no tenshi) has a scene where Zack takes two drugs, one is vitamins and the other is a drug that makes him insane. I've wondered what that second drug was. I don't know if you can figure that out, but it'll be a fun episode (maybe).

EDIT: Or you could talk about how much Zack bleeds, but the only good shots are in the anime (he inflicts the injury (a slashed gut) in episode 6, and gets treatment in episode 11). I would like to see you pick apart my favourite show so I hope you do. PleaseüòÅ

I‚Äôm about to ruin your life
Villagers are rigged
takes a deep breath   I normally don't like to post comments, but I think that your conclusion on the price of a Mario coin would be more accurate if you used the maple syrup from the item shop to do the calculation.  The truth about cymbals is that the better the composition of the metal and the amount of physical labor that is put into it, the more expensive it is.  I don't think it is fair to just write it off. Real world cymbals can cost anywhere from 40 bucks to over 300 for a single cymbal.  If you used the maple syrup it would be a more accurate measurement, because instead of looking at a hundred dollar difference you are looking at a couple dollars difference, being that maple syrup is anywhere between 2-4 dollars depending on where you live.
  Also, when you talked about the sims, you said  "the same tub", again they similar yes, but not the same.  For this instance I would have used a particular style of fridge, and then took the average of the same style of fridge.  This is because again price of tubs can vary depending on many different styles or where holes are located.  However, styles of fridges tend to be rounded a little closer together unless you go for like a super high end brand.



   THAT BEING SAID, in the overall scheme of the video, it SHOULD NOT make that big of a difference, it was just a way that you could make the measurements more accurate.  You do amazing work, and keep doing what your doing my nerdy mathematical-loving friend.
For the sims why did you just use painting...? A level 10 at virtually any career makes you more than that a day. Especially with the ‚ÄúGet Famous‚Äù pack, where you can be an actor and make thousands of simoleans at the lowest levels in the actor career. Or the detective branch. Or photography skills. Sims can be much more richer than that...
Luigi is the richest
If you're going to use wheat to figure out how rich the Minecraft protagonist is in terms of wheat, you've got to consider just producing wheat. You'd end up with a somewhat higher number.
I forgive you.
I bet it's the tertratominal
Am I the only one who noticed that mario's total net worth is incorrect. The total they based it off of was the series total BEFORE Odyssey. Unless they found the total number of coins in Odyssey and added it to that total, they need to redo it.

For Minecraft: can‚Äôt you just FARM the wheat instead of trying to find emeralds? By the rarity of emeralds and the fact that it is fairly easy to just keep a ridiculously sized wheat farm and pick up wheat each time it grows and replant the seeds to create and exponentially increasing farm size. Furthermore, Minecraft has pumpkins that grow to a size of a meter by a meter, wouldn‚Äôt that be a more notable estimation?
Yeah Austin!
As an anthropologist please I beg you to strike the term primitive call it ancient. And strike the term civilization no one in American anthropology likes that term.

For the dovahkiin from Skyrim you can enchant gear for better alchemy then use that gear to make fortify enchanting potions and use those potions to make even better alchemy if you rinse and repeat enough times you can enchant suuuuuuper powerful and therefore super valuable gear and also make super powerful potions which you can sell for a lot the only problem would be the merchants not having enough money to buy your potions and gear
Welp, good thing I didn't bet money on Minecraft being #1
Yay you're #5 trending in gaming.
steve and every other minecraft players are able to visit earth-like planets and they get to name them which means they bought a lot of solar systems.

where's matt patt
I love this channel lol
Can we get a theory on an scp?
Hold it!

With Minecraft, you can also sell wheat, carrots, ECT to villagers.
As NPC's, villagers have a potentially infinite amount of emeralds, provided you refresh their trades every so often.

Now, you can create automated farms in Minecraft, using Redstone. And since you can just build more and more farms, your amount of wealth will eventually grow faster and faster.
Now, to not be said we are using exploits/slave labor, we will not be using Carrot, Wheat, or Potato farms, as those require villagers to automate. Instead, we can focus on Sugar Cane, Pumpkins, and Melons.

Sugarcane can be crafted into paper which then can be sold. Using the best prices we can get from villager trading, we have 24 paper for an emerald, 8 pumpkins for an emerald, and 7 melons for an emerald.

I would personally recommend that Steve/Alex makes their fortune off of Pumpkins, as that requires no crafting, since melons break apart.

I don't believe I need to give the rates at which pumpkin farms operate, especially considering how you can just build more, increasing the rate even faster.

But honestly, anything that generates money that you don't have to constantly manage is going to lead to incredible wealth, so for other games, you have to consider the rate of exponential increase.

Dear Austin, I have a fun one for you. While I understand the hilarity of the things that can happen because of ragdoll physics, I have on multiple occasions encountered a thing in Fallout 4 that is most frustrating in wanting to loot a corpse.
This anomaly only seems to  occur when using ballistic rifles. Occasionally when I headshot raiders and I get a killcam, the head will either decapitate or explode, but then the body will launch into the sky at great velocity.
One of many ways to discuss how broken ragdoll physics character death, really is? Or at least tell me what my bullets would have to be doing to create these WTF moments as I watch my loot soar into space, along with the attached corpse.

3:47 Forever, Austin. For-freakin-EVER!!! Thumbs up for the 76 rip though.
Austin i hope you know that your th eonly reason im still subbed to the game theorists anyways keep up the work
I'm surprised that Fortnite wasn't part of this video.
Hey I thought of a theory I'm Not sure if its been done but you could try to see how strong spy Ross charge attack is theres an example of it when you fight the green frog thing üòÖ the first boss here sorry I forgot his name
Too bad Pete from the Harvest Moon series never makes these lists... I really, REALLY want to know how rich of a farmer he really is!
4:56 check out a book called "debt the first 5000 years". Its on audible.
What about other videogames like Terraria, Subnautica, Fortnite, etc, etc.
why not use maple syrup for mario rpg?
austin, did you remember to take into account the fact that you can sell stuff to villagers? that's one of the best methods for easy emeralds
Dude look it up
Who else got a Nintendo advert before this??
If handsome jack isn't in your list I'm done. Richest person I could think of. (Borderlands)
GET OUT MATPAT WANNABE
farm wheat to emeralds or pumpkins, melons and carrots all which have crazy automated farms which pump out thousands per hour. suddenly steve and alex does not seem like such a bad choice
Hi
The game in the desc ruined it
The first Luigi's Mansion Game canonically took place in one night - and this is matched by the general playtime of the game, which is around 8 hrs. So Luigi is worth 1 million... every 8 hours.  Multiplying that out over the 50 year career (90558hrs) by the math at the beginning of this video puts Luigi at a career total of $11,983,134,666.56, assuming he changed his career from plumbing to ghostbusting.  This obviously depends on the assumption that Luigi can acquire a new haunted mansion every 8 hours, but ironically this insane ability is supported by the 2nd Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon (and now the upcoming 3rd one!) where he acquires not one, but FIVE new "Mansions" in a once-again canon overnight (14 hr 6 min avg playtime). This averages out to acquiring a new mansion every 2.8 hours.  Either way, you were right about MatPat being wrong... Luigi isn't a millionaire, he's a Billionaire.
Eeeeooooeeeeeooooeeeeee eeeawam a wa!
Where is mat pat!?!
Didnt someone here say that Fallout 76 would be like the best game ever
Except that's on your standard single player world. On most multiplayer servers I've seen, Iron, Gold, or even diamonds are the main trade currency (sometimes all 3 are used or, more commonly, a standardized, premade plug in is used giving the player a currency system, though usually this holds only mostly on prison servers), and villagers seem to vary on their conversion rates -- some want 2 emeralds for the same thing another wanted 1 -- its more of a bartering system. As such, steve/ alex's worth could vary. Still, it surprises me that they, along with mario, are THAT low on the list.
Austin I have a question about the Steve/Alex wealth what is instead of mining emeralds you farm wheat and turn it into emeralds?
My bet: Cave Johnson or GLaDOS from Portal
WHERES THE FORZA WORLD WITH THE FORZA CREDITS
Scrooge Mc'Dracula. I cannot unsee it.
The guy from Adventure capitalist. The end.

After you finish posting all the episodes, upload a super cut of every episode edited together. Much more convenient for binging
Are we gana miss how he said he could only find symbols but there's maple syrup for sale 11:23
I love these videos, you‚Äôre so cute Austin lol
OH BOY, hopefully you didn't forget Joker from Persona 5, who could theoretically make 10 Million Yen a day for almost a whole year.
With the Dragonborn, did you even consider the Speech skill? The vendors tend to make their stuff more expensive than they are actually worth. Did you perhaps compare the price to carrots as well? Salt? Venison? lots of real-life equivalents.
The pokemon games follow real time
austin your forgetting how rediculas alchemy is for making money and the fact that the dovakin can use a transmute spell to turn iron into gold yeah I actually tested this out creating a character that was only focused on making money I had maxed out speech and he crafting skills as soon as possible and to say I got rich even for a skyrim character is a understatement
Ryaman???
13:19 That was cold.
Aw not Austin
Austin should be on the dollar bill
oh my Minecraft vs Mario lets watch this video *Austin speaks*................. oh its not mat pat never mind I guess I just won't watch this video
I'd just put Mario and Luigi together because... In almost every mario game, Luigi is playable to the 2nd player, and the coin counter is shared too, as a matter of fact.
Therefore, this brings Luigi's net worth a million ahead of Mario's
Betting smogg from Hobbit game or Batman from gotham

I love that all your background music is famous classical music!
But Austin, i legitimatly got under the map in Skyrim and stole from that chest
The "um, actually" for minecraft is real.
3:01 Successful people don't work average hours.
Wait, what happens in a couple of months?
so Mario's net worth is for all Mario games but Luigi's is only for Luigi's mansion while there is already a second game
You Know who's doing the video when compose is hit.
1:11 ... How does he know me so well?
1:10 how the f dous he now
Can't wait for the next episode of "The Quest to Find the Richest Video Game Character of All Time or some stupid crap like that"!

Where MAT PAT
Call of duty bo4 there‚Äôs a person with a trillion or somthing in the story mode
Just a question, but can‚Äôt you play as Luigi in all the Mario games therefore allowing him to collected the coins which makes him richer than Mario?
Hey um matpat did you notice that in Salad Fingers the glass mother looks like the body that salad called his brother like the one under the tree like is the body salad called his brother like is it the glass mother or bigger is it the glass *father*!!!!
Steve clearly.
Because there is a massive number of worlds in minecraft so almost an infinite amount of diamonds and gold.
and there are inf emeralds in minecraft so inf money.
This series makes me happy, thank you Austin!!!!
That AdVenture Capitalist dude
I'm actually really liking Austin's performance in this episode
1:13 ... was on the toilet.. am now contemplating life with video on pause.
Austin is Discord
Can‚Äôt believe i just got a minecraft add, never had one before
What about grey man
NO ONE CAN BE RICHER THAN LUIGI
arent they plantains in donkey kong?

Haha! EA makes the most.
Austin you‚Äôre the best
Scrooge whenever it comes to the richest its always scrooge mcduck
Scrooge McDuck is basically immortal, he was born in the 1800s for goodness sake.
My vote is on link
:0
I wonder where shovel knight is on the scale?
But Fortnite took over Minecraft
So a good deal of Luigi's wealth that MattPatt calculated was the value of the house and it's contents. Not just the gold?

Or did you account for that already.
Dude!!!! Fantasia üòçüòçüòç

5:24 I legit went "Oh, I didn't know that."
Then my brain kicked in...
As a former ballet dancer of many years, you gave me a ptsd flashback by playing Waltz of the Flowers at the end. It‚Äôs March!! I wasn‚Äôt braced for the sounds of nightmaresüò≠üò≠
11:38 what abuot Maple syrup if you go a couple of seconds back you see maple syrup at the bottom of the list
"No body works 24 hours a day 7 days a week." That is true, though Prinnies work 20 hour work days with no breaks.

His little rants make me laugh uncontrollably lol
I wonder how many say this thumbnail is cancerous.
Down vote because of Austin.
If steal would sell the other resources he earns than he would be much more richer.
my initial guess would be me from skyrim. b/c of a buff you can get from thieves guild quests you find extra gems all over the place. this has lead me to have 2 million gold and an additional 3 million in trade goods. i did the math. additional un-mathed capital includes but is not limited to many fully furnished houses, arguably priceless equipment for lore reasons and more potions than a country could drink in a month. all of this in just over an in-game year.
Mario
What's the song from beginning of the video?
why is this categorized as gaming for super Mario odyssey? and were is mattpat? is he sick?
apparently its mario because thats what the youtube gaming thing says
I hope Auther Morgan is in there
Batman
They did it, they pissed him off and now he can't be stopped.
When MatPat roasts Youtube
Gamers agreeing in the comments


Love this so much!
This is the first MatPat video I've ever watched, and I think I'm staying üòÅ
As a soap maker, I will totally work as an employee if you start a theory soap brand.
Anyone else think mat would be a great inspirational speaker I have a dream that YouTube will be great agian
Youtubers: makes 20 million dollars for charity
Media: yawns
The reason why advertisers jump off of YouTube so easily is so that they can negotiate even lower ad pricing when they join back.
I say we get this as the most liked YouTube video, to show people the REAL news, and not just what the news companies want you to believe
mattpat, your almost TOO sharp...almost...


This was such a powerful video and i can not be more impressed with the ambiance you bring when you sit on that easter egg colored couch. Never change.
Wasn't Youtube Kids made for the content that would be good for kids?
If it's still around then update it already.
I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt like his content, you can‚Äôt deny how important matpat is to this platform and everyone on it
So the exposed story, is that everyone's actually helping.
"YouTubers are great!"
- Mattpat, 2019
OKAY BUT CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE MATTY'S LITERAL MIC DROP AT 21:24


I don't know why but it's my favorite part of the video x3
You always speak the truth and I love it. Also, we rant when we're passionate about things. If you didn't rant, we wouldn't see how real things are, so thank you, and never stop being you. I love both you and your videos, including these, not just your theories. Need some facts once in awhile as well.
Probably the best video I've watched in years.
Next game theory IS MATPAT HUMAN BECAUSE HE DOES WAY TOO MUCH MATH
MatPat is having none of it.
MatPat has no chill and I fkin love it
MatPat is such a good speaker that he could talk about why the earth is flat and I would probably consider it...  Is that bad?
The 5.1k dislikes was definitely from YouTube being salty that they got called out
‚Äú-some what educational‚Äù

somewhat? 
SOMEWHAT?

MatPat... you‚Äôve helped me with tests more than my own notes
I came here thinking MatPat would diss famous channels, being a bit mad, and clicked. I got something SO MUCH BETTER
I may not understand everything that goes on with creators, I don't know exactly what happens behind the scenes , all I want to say is that the media is crazy. Its ineffable for me what im trying to say. I have so much in my mind but i cant word it out.
When I see this, I feel bad. It's like some people don't want others to be happy or just want to create chaos in the world.
My GOD, Matt, I'm Drowning In This Tea You Spilling, And I LOVE IT! #GLOATMATT
I completely agree on all the points, but I think that "moral-based" comparison to the sports industry is weak since no one watches sports for the outlook on life individual players might have...  Even in the movie industry, any stance a celebrity might have is more like a spillover from the main thing and is far more under the control of the industry itself.
That is the point actually... Control. Every youtuber has a voice of his own and mostly all that a youtuber is is "a voice of their own". This is completely contrary to what a traditional celebrity is. This is what the stakeholders fear - an association with the ideas - ideas that are out of their control. This is also why youtube looks and feels more and more like TV, this is a push from the traditional entertainment ideology.


I think a third option will present itself eventually. Ad companies will have to, at least partly, adapt. Individual creators are too many and bring in most of the revenue and you cannot streamline/polish them since that way they lose their lure.
we just need matpat to run youtube
Brilliantly said. Wow. Thank you for making this video, hope it makes the impact it deserves!
Tfw Johnny deep is is innocent... Awkward
So i‚Äôve Hand  depression and anxiety ever sence I remember. And I‚Äôm only 12 right know, the biggest memory of being depressed is in 3th grade. And last year in 5th grade, I don‚Äôt remember what video it is, but it helped me tell people about it; and now I‚Äôm getting way better. It hurts me to hear what people are you to you and Stephanie, stuff you don‚Äôt deserve to go through! Your awesome, amazing, THE BEST! I hope this all moves on, and gets better. I also hope you get all your money back.

P.S. your baby is so cute!!!
Wow just pure gold love this 



shared this in a group chat without context they all thought I was mad at them
This video should become obligatory watching for any journalist attempting to write anything about anything YouTube-related.
About Johnny Depp, I really doubt he abused but I cant prove anything of course
Music channels earn millions per video, I don't see them donating much
So it's true, Gamers are the most oppressed group of people.
God has a pencil
Matpat has a highlighter 
God drew the world but...




Matpat made brighter! ( ‚ó†‚Äø‚ó† ) 
I mean it!
Youtubers: raise 20 Million dollars


The Media: Wait, that's illegal.
I know not the point but Johnny Depp was the one being abused
This should be in research papers. -> "People who play games are more charitable"
But, come to think of it, others would say that it is improper evidence because of the lack other measurements. Also, this is a great video and great on the gaming community. Keep it up! :D
i was in the verge of crying until matpat showed the clip of logan saying "resp3k"
This video made my heart break, and I don't know why...
MatPat: Makes amazing videos, and gets onto the #1 trending on multiple videos
Google: ‚ÄúMid-Tier Influencer‚Äù
Well said...If someone ever negatively generalizes about online creators I'm gonna have to send them this.
My God, this is the hottest rap album this year. FIRE BARS.

Awesome video Matt!
Maybe MatPat is cosplaying Bonnie with that hair.
Make a video with Colleen about this please!!! You both are like the only ones I know saying anything
Why isn‚Äôt this in trending? YouTube you ain‚Äôt slick!
this is so sad, because you know it's true :'<
(1) Fear sells.
(2) Supporting personalities instead of gimmicks is unpredictable, thus there is no guarantee of profit.
(3) This topic is incredibly important.
It‚Äôs just a opinion MY OPINION THANKS FOR WATCHING!
a true man does not cry.
whoever said that can be burned against a stake.
THE MAN KOUN'NA IS CRYING SO HARD
I like this serious Matpad video
Everyone's a hypocrite, that's life. Apparently.
YouTube uses Roast creator!
It's very effective.
MatPat uses MatPats Rage!
It's super effective.
Youtube fainted!
Love d this- just one thing is actually Amber Heard that abused Johnny Depp...
Not a fan of Game Theory, but you got respects from me man. Good video
So when is MatPat gonna be CEO of YouTube?
realizes mats shirt
WHY MICHAEL WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO!!!!!!
so true, very well explained and eye-opening.
Thank you for sharing with us :)
False accusations towards Johnny depp but I agree with this video ye
MatPat for President! üéâüá∫üá∏ Sincere, open, and well thought out and admits when he is wrong. On top of that, his orator skills are TOP notch. 10/10 would vote for.
2M views, huh?

Not on the trending, huh?

sTICKING UP FOR YOUTUBERS, HUH?
this is deeper than I thought it would be
James Charles decided to end his career early
The real pain I AM feeling and what you should be feeling too is not that POEPLE don't appreciate all those good deeds but.......
That all the good deeds are not being accounted for what they truly can be
I get it, if you ppl r having hard time, have some virtual hugs from me, üòä
He protecc
He attac 
But most importantly 
He try‚Äòs to bring the brown hair bacc
I agree what matpat said,Gamers are real influencers on what their do and stuff.

Well said Matpat well said
I said this before and I'll say it again: matpat saved my life. I was going to kill my self a while back and one of his videos stopped me. my original comment is probs buried but regardless
Hey! At least MARK never ate a TIDE POD...
Why does this vid have dislikes? Are they gay?
I'm beyond grateful you mentioned my name in this. More importantly showing the world how much good comes from YouTube. Thanks to all of yall out there who help others in need.
Why does this vid have dislikes? Are they gay?
Why does this vid have dislikes? Are they gay?
Amazing video. +1 Watched this all the way from start to end and I agree with everything you said here.
Been watching for a long time now but this was finally the best reason I subscribed
Just remember, this happened because matpat read a label
I'm so proud of this community!
The Youtuber Creators are still relevant Godammit!!!
14:35 funny you say that, James Charles youtube career has already ended but he wasn‚Äôt the one who ended it. Tati was.
Matpat:(Called a medium influencer)
LETS MAKE A VIDEO
This video was exactly 20 seconds shorter than that video.


Edit: No DanTDM? SERIOUSLY?!
Salute to MatPat for unfolding the truths behind some of YouTube's dirtiest actions.

Proud to be a part of this "army of goodwill giving".
Thank you, Matpat. This Video just made my day...seeing how am,zing this platform really is, has brought tears of joy into my eyes...
DrLupo raised 1 million for saint jude
I don't think it's quite an opinion, I think it's the sad truth! I feel so much better hearing this from you, good things!
YouTube is a great platform run by people that don't even care about their community.
Rewind 2018 literally totally out of sync with what's actually going on and/or what people want and certain categories being treated differently comapred to others.
There‚Äôs two couches I‚Äôm afraid of.

1. The casting couch.
2. Matpat‚Äôs couch.
Vsauce3 deserves so much more ;(
2019: mainstream media platforms ridiculing youtubers

I'm not even kidding when I say this might be the best video I've ever seen on YouTube. I love this.
Dont expose MY story............So Im a guy Who got a laptop Of my brother and play roblox and Undertale and then i make youtube channel very cool
Ninja: hold my beer.
Ends up on the Ellen show
Yeah I agree I have depression and anxiety but i cant take pills because last time u did i almost died...so I dont take pills so youtube helps me
It's been confirmed
MatPat is working with Thanos
I was disappointed that it wasn't a theory, but was surprised when it was something better
My heart can't take all this good... I'm literally tearing up (T^T)
I know that he doesn‚Äôt do much of these rants, but i think he should make another channel for them called   
Drumrollpls *MATRANT (I‚Äôm sry) and if u think i hate rants by him,I don‚Äôt
Matpat what can us  viewers  do to help the YouTuber's like you and others YouTuber's
17:36
So... how's that comment holding up MatPat?
Of course YouTube didn't put this on trending
YouTube did an oopsie
Good one, matpat. Keep up the good work. The Idea of community could one day become a reality that has some powerfull potential and serious implication in so many ways, both online and in the real world, where there are structures that wanna actually work as a community.
I believe people underestimate this, but times have changed since the 70's and not all of it is bad.
You always rant but I love that you speak the truth. People need to judge a person by their actions instead of an entire group. It goes bigger than YouTube. Sadly it's everywhere. Thank you for the good work.
YES SUPERCARLINBROTHERS THEY ARE MY FAVORITE (sorry you‚Äôre my second)
I really like these kinda videos üñí

I dont want my future ruined ;-;
Apparently, the term "Youtube Gamer" is deemed more scary than "Hollywood Pedophile"
Why doesn't he put the link to his other channel in the description ?
THIS.
WE ARE NOT THE BADGUYS
I am taking your word and spreading theme in my country

Your speech touches my heart 
Because it's the truss no one like to admit
This gave me hope. Back to offensive meme compilations now

‚ÄúShoot I DID end up going on a rant! I didn‚Äôt mean to- well I guess I did. Well- it was needed‚Äù 
(Not exactly stated don‚Äôt @ me)
This is me in a random conversation with friends I swear
MatPat, your hair is great. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
they don't want you to make it. SO YOU GOTTA MAKE IT. thanks for letting us know about these double standards! good luck to you and the team.
I'm liking this new rant-matpat ^_^
Insert Vote MatPat for YouTube CEO comment here.
I still watch sponge DONT JUDGE ME
Unfortunately, the news tends to focus on blood, gore, doom, gloom, and the darkness because that gives them views, therfore, more money and relevance. It's for that reason as to why there might never be a shortage of mass violence, especially with the way its reported (in the US, anyway).

You see, the news media takes everything out on online platforms because they're easier to harp on, especially since online things have been getting bigger than the television and magazine platforms in recent years.

Yes, there are problems on the online platforms that must be addressed but, however, you are correct, that advertiser hypocrisy hurts  , big or small.
But YOU'RE my favourite channel
wait wait wait..
we missed a group who is also doing charity
The Game Theorists and GTLive
okay that's one
I guess Pewdiepie saying "Gamers are the most oppressed group" wasn't completely for the meme all along...
Your channel helps people with their anxiety and depression?
I am a fan that is in both of those fan categories QwQ
Online Media: watches this video

Also Online Media: gets distracted by a butterfly
The way you bring light to these kinds of issues truly inspires me all the time. I've been more active than ever on your videos in terms of making actual comments because no other channel (besides Phillip Defranco) that I watch regularly tackles these kinds of things as head on as you do. I have been a gamer my entire life and have always watched as gamers are pushed to the back of the crowd, made to look way lesser than we are. 

I am most definitely one of the people that has gotten through tough times through you and Steph's hilarious antics. One of the people who can learn so much about so many things from watching theories about games I've never played before. You and every other gaming Youtuber out there deserves WAY more credit for all the things that you guys do every year. Thank you for making these kinds of videos and fighting against the unfortunate bad PR that you all get lumped into. I'm infinitely proud to share a home state with you MatPat, keep up the amazing work.
Can I just say that this is my favorite video released by matpat.
Petition to call Matpat giving a lesson on the couch "Couch-Pat"
policy=business \\\\\\ religion=charity 


both should never cross they're literally the opposite of each other...
Love the video but the johnny Depp point is idiotic considering the man was found innocent and has actually been abused by her üëÄ
Dont worry, man. Your amazing. We love you, MatPat!
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

Keep on fighting my fellow gamers and youtubers.
Okay, lets get this to trending boiz
I always watch the game theorist when I am sad, feeling like I want to die, and when my knees hurt..!
You, Stephanie and everyone connected to you, are without a doubt the best. Thank you for being you.
I feel like YouTube should watch this.
Literal mic drop. Well played, Matthew.
Youtuber: Makes one dark joke


Media: I'm going to end this man's career
This is the length of a Family Guy episode.






I don‚Äôt know why I said that, but I wanted to.
I agree whole-heartedly! I appreciate that you're spreading the word about this issue. I've had several friends be heavily affected by these scenarios and despite all their efforts, it continues to plague them, as well as millions of other content creators across not only YouTube, but other platforms as well.
"It's an opinion. My opinion. Thanks for watching"
Drops mike
Why your not explaining why YouTube protects Big YouTubers who steal smaller Creator's content?
I don't know about you guys, but I really like these little "rants" about these topics that other people refuse to talk about.
MatPat, you are a really amazing youtuber ^,.,^ Keep up the absolutely amazing work.
OMG ITS PURPLE HAIR DADPAT
anyone else actually love when he rants? XD its entertaining and interesting.

Can you give a TED talk. Like about literally anything. I really want you to give a TED talk
Now this is the quality content I came for. Drag them, MatPat
Marpat can you please make a video on we happy few? Thanks
Burn the shirt


love you. love your videos. burn the shirt
If im being honest this made me cry and told me that I should do my best. Youtube has actually made me a better person in general.
Just one video that sums up a few reasons about why I love this community.
i have been watching your videos for years without being subscribed apparently.
Damn I love this guy >3
MatPat you need to go back in future and do the videos you were making 
:/ what about the intro.
It may not mean much, but this video alone has earned so much respect from me. I truly understand what you're saying and more importantly the way you say it is so powerful! Much respect man
"But hey, it's just...well its not a theory, it's an opinion.... 
My opinion. 
Thanks for watching" 
so powerful. We all are behind you.
That was freaking amazing! Love u MatPat
This made me cry üò≠






Beautiful speech
You saved my life. I was gonna end my life... But you made me think
I wanna see how tf fnaf ends...
Also can you do theories of slenderman or horror movies like hush?
Like the dantdm and bijuu mike relationship.get your guns ready
We know its serious when he's on the couch
THANK YOU MATT PAT. (Honestly)
Love this video but when it comes to Johnny Depp, please do your research. He was the victim of abuse by his ex wife. She made the accusations to harm his reputation, continuing her abuse.
I totally agree YouTube/google is getting worst and worst for creators and consumers . You have my support Mat! One of my favorite creators üëçüèª
Preach it to us MatPat, preach it to us.üòã Also it mad me so mad when I saw that people don't want positive press about YouTubers, especially gamers AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(FRICKIN RIPS HAIR OUT!!!), I'm ok, love for MatPat, and all gamers and illistraters out there.
It's confirmed. Gamers are the most oppressed group.
Not to be that person but it was revealed that Johnny Depp's wife was actually abusing him. Johnny is the victim.
Johnny Depp had allegations and of recent I believe it was found his EX abused him!
Mat makes 1 video about real talk. (Sees analytics on it).....(makes 2 more real talk videos). The analytic master MatPat
damb Mat Pat that was awesome!!!.....well said my friend well said.....10000000% agree with you......you got a thumbs up from me and a share.......keep up the great work ;)
All those in favor of a MatPat rant channel?




I
Oh no....
I think he's wearing a Michael Jackson shirt
The end of that was kind of hilarious. More to the point, though, I want to thank you for putting into words what I, and many others, have been thinking and feeling for years.
You made my day! I was very aggressively upset and mad but you fixed it!
This actually made me SHOOK
I've been demonetized from YouTube for 2 months now... For... Reused Content (When all my videos are MINE) and they don't even explain what that means or where I break that rule... I love YouTube but I hate to see them turning their back on their creators...
Then Jeff Bezos donated a day's worth of earnings and suddenly the gaming part on the pie chart turned into a strip üòÇüòÇ
Goddamn this was powerful.
this is amazing. thank you.
I watch super Carlin brothers so it‚Äôs cool you said him lol. Also I love him bc he is a theorist
Mat Pat dropping the nuke of youtube. This is the real deal when it comes to quality content.
15:41 Me yelling at my parents: STOP MAKING A BLOOMING UNION UP THERE Sniff
You should do a collab with adam ruins everything
Thank you for this video, MatPat.
that was beautiful, adn extremely accurate.. thanks matpat!!!
My boy matpat exposing everyone. Lets get this MVP to trending we can do it.
Fantastic video. I hope you do more stuff like this.
Yo the Johnny depp thing was de bunked and it was actually the wife who abused him. Agree with everything else tho üòÑüëçüèª
You have a MJ shirt ima fan
I'm about to cry. This is amazing. I feel the same way.
1.6 mil views and it dropped 1 day ago. But still not trending...hmmmm...
Gamers sure are generous. After all people still buy games from EA.
Man, if only our planet was ran by MatPat and more minds like him... swoons while imagining a better version of our world
Give this guy an Oscar for onesty and sharing the truth with us.  
   God belss you all
you helped me more than anyone could when it comes to history and biology...
How much do you bet this won't reach trending.
Meanwhile, Pichu is high tier, who also if you send MatPat flying can use Thunder and it does anti-knockback.
Since I know you have so many Google products, could you please auction/ give me some of them, I'm kind of a fan
That Johnny Depp comment didn‚Äôt age well... But, I agree with everything else! Thanks for speaking up for every youtuber.
Welp, he's right he's completely, right.
So basically, gamers rise up
The rasing money for trans kid made me cry a little- on behalf of me, an FTM trans, I thank you 
Amazing video Mat.
You outdid yourself, as always.

Edit:
Man, even DisneyDan and Defuncteland? Man I love this platform.
MatPat for President 2024!
It's amazing that there is someone who is able to do their own research, formulate a solid opinion, and is able to verbalize it as eloquently as MatPat does, and I think that how he comes across as so genuine, he'd be able to do really well in politics. become the biggest Influencer.
Videos like this are amazing continue the good work I would like to see more content like this
i dont know why some of ur video descriptions or titles are in spanish...like a chilean see these videos, gets my very rare feels... are u doing this translation? o maybe is youtube?, anyway, idk its so... soft <3and sweet
just melting my heart with this hahahah

PD: btw, can u just do it a video about latin viewers? or something related with us?  idk, its just a doubt that i have

bye <3
When MatPat sits on the couch it is like my mom saying Christopher instead of Chris.
I think you kind of owe Johnny Depp an apology at this point no?
Dude I want that "captain Eo" shirt.
When you wake up and see it missing Just know that I got it. along with your coldest diet coke.
I legit cry every time I watch this video. When he talks about how this community is a supportive community full of people making the world a better place, I can't stop myself from getting a huge wave of emotions
WHY ARE THERE 5000 DISLIKES?? HOW COULD YOU HSTE THIS? XD
And then matpat was never let on the trending page again
just watched 20 minutes of MatPat unintentionally spilling all of the tea on his couch.
real reasons I love this channel.
You talked som much about the wonderful things others have done( dont get me wrong they are amazing), but you ignored all the amazing, world helping, and truly special things you have done. Thank you for everything.
OMG Gronkh, love the man :3
Mat, is that michael jackson in your t shirt?
Summary: One video doesn't make up the whole Youtube community, there are a lot of good people out here in Youtube
But hey, that's just an opinion.
A game opinion!
Thanks for watching...
johnny depp was the one abused by his wife, that came out recently - but this video is beautiful and i appreciate it incredibly
I love your shirt btw the purple hair looks good on you
He should make a intro for these type of videos
Damn it MatPat, you said what we all want to say. Thank you
Like the Michael Jackson shirt
working with supercel & lego,thats impressive.
nice Captain EO shirt...thanks for reminding us about the cursed documentary
News: People on YouTube are bad

MatPat: Wait a minute meme
soneone get this on trending
No could have said it better than you MatPat, keep up the fight my dude!
Rip youtube article 13 is approved
I actually started tearing up watching this üôèüôèüôè I applaud you matpat.
Johnny Depp is a pretty bad example since it's becoming clear that Amber Heard was actually the abuser... I guess you could use her as an example
Hey I'm a YouTube Gamer
Hey I'm a mid tier influencer üëç
despite watching matt very rarely , I think this is a very informational and amazing video. Keep it up
All this said without a single name being called or swearing....quality viewing experience and quite clear POV....good job, Mat, good job! This is how you prove a point...so well organised, articulated, and thought out all while being 100% authentic!
I love your videos, you have helped me a lot through and I just want to say thank you
I heard a podcast with one of the CEOs from YouTube . they seemed disconnected af.
This is the most important video of 2019.
You can see when matpat gets pissed
His eyes just seem to say ‚ÄúI will find you media people. And I will roast you‚Äù
You are beautifully well spoken and articulate.
Seriously amazing
do a plants vs zombies garden warfare 2 theory
If you dont think there is anything to theorise you are wrong
MatPat should be the director of the next YouTube Rewind :vvv



Edit: Wow so many likes xD Thanks and  I support what MatPat says. Adds also help me for my mission. I make video talking about Anime. If you like, take a look :‚Äù) will help me a lot.
YouTube is literally the largest community you can easily find
I love your content keep up the good work
Matpat, I‚Äôll tell you your place, explaining stuff to me(random YouTube watcher) 
Thanks for that by the way
Mid-Tier influencer. Yet he was on stage for the Stadia keynote. I'd say that's pretty damn huge.
I like this new sit-down and talk format you've used for these recent videos.
This is making me cry happy tries he so cool I love he video'süòäüòä
Mic dropped no joke he‚Äôs right so correct very good love you keep going you need to keep saying this everyone spread the word please do it please
It's perfectly fine to rant like this! The world needs to know what is going on, and I couldn't think of anyone better to shove the truth in their face. Your work is A+ material, don't let anyone lable or otherwise tell you, or anyone else you know any different. Like you said, you "do great work, positive work". And in this day and age, thats all I can ask for. Keep it up!
Dude your great . I've been around sense 2012/2013 and I wanted to think you for all the vids and info witch have helped me through my depression and thinks for more info about my fave channells. Butt anyway your my fave so again thinks for everything.
Media: Those youtubers are evil!
Matpat: Dumps 784736 pages of evidence that youtubers and gamers in specific are worldwide positive influencers who fund charity work and hundreds of other amazing things  
Media: Don't listen to him, he's a filthy youtube gamer!
0:57 I‚Äôm saving that for when I‚Äôm talking with my kids.
i only just watched his video and wow. matpat and all the other gaming channels are truly something here on youtube. keep up the good work guys, you've really helped a lot of people!
MatPat wear Michael Jackson Captain Eo! üòÆ
She: ‚Äúhe must be thinking of other girls now‚Äù
My brain: this 21:32 talks of MatPat
He should make a podcast called "couch time with matpat"   please like so he will see this

Edit: darn there already was a podcast, thanks for telling me guys!
News sites be like 
"Angry YouTube Gamer Rants Violently Towards Media Outlets in a Threatening Manner"
Simply... I just love this channel ‚ù§
I literally cried especially the part when you talk about online content being a positive influence. I created an account just so I can comment on my favorite youtube games. 

What can we do Matpat to help you make a change? Besides sharing your content.
14:40 is 1000% true for James Charles
He's been cancelled for being a predator
Idk about Markiplier though
Only things i learned from this is...
 
Ads are horrible
Google is f******up 
Matpat is a youtube hero

Basically he is the speaker of the gods
I‚Äôm happy he said supercell cause that mean he plays clash Royale CoC or Brawl Stars
High horse, prepare for dismount
Just to give you an idea on Johnny Depp, he is suing his ex wife because all of what she said he did was fabricated. I guess the Mr. Depp has videos, pictures and a multitude of other substantiating evidence. No conclusive results yet so this is still speculation, but just thought I might bring this to light.
Anytime I have my friend over she always says I wanna watch mat pat wanna watch matpat and we once fell asleep watching your fnaf playlist when we woke we realized our sinüòÇ and  made a lot of coffee ‚òïÔ∏èand stayed up watching your  videos all night.üòõ
We were in a fight and watched your vids and we got along thank you for saving our friendshipü§ùüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
This is the type of rant that actually does something. Like, he ACTUALLY did his research, had GOOD points, and overall was able to back up his argument. People need to take notes.
MatPat is threatening with his knowledge omllll
Small editing mistake at 6:35 hehe


Sorry I'm an editor and I can't help notice these things
Allow me to summarise this" sponsor me pls" I love you matpat
Matpay u raise some very good points keep it up my man üëçüëçüëç
This is the millionth time that MatPat has been right
I love Mr. Beast I'm subbed
Good job, ya pissed him off and now we're gonna get a ton of videos of him on his couch staring into the camera lol
You have helped me with my struggling in school with science and math plus I am a struggling YouTube gamer with no idea what to do and no new ideas on what to play you have helped me since 2013 and all I have to say is 
Thank you 
Thank you for 6 years of science math and gaming and FNAF lore 
Thank you.
Man, I NEVER knew how everyone ignored gamers and YouTubers.

Oof. That‚Äôs rough. (I‚Äôm not being sarcastic.)
When Mat Pat sits on the couch it's like my Principle calling me to the office....
$5 says he gets copyright strike by Disney for captain EO
Coryxkenshin might be a sycopath
Can someone just sit Susan down in front of this video please?
So... Conan/TeamCoCo aren't and never will be a top-tier Youtube channel since they've got a gaming show..?
Or, y'know... Maybe Youtube is just a shitty double-standard company??
When is he going to make a CouchTheory channel?
Your my favorite YouTube channel so what aren‚Äôt you telling us
All the dislikes are from the "traditional media" and "traditional celebrities" that got called out
Like man the all mighty shaggy will smite YouTube and the people making this platform apresed
Matpat Being the spokesperson and hero for good work in the community. He is a champion and one I truly respect. One that shows the good of the world but also the evils of the world and brings it to light. A hero people can rally around and fight for. My hero
GG m8




beautiful
Theory soap...
I need it
This video has basically explained everything I have been thinking about.
Some people are only willing to believe what they want to believe. Some people and/or things are underrated by others that have judged and told others so that when others hear about them, they think negatively about them before they actually see what they are like so they have someone one else's opinion rather than developing their own opinion.
Thank you for helping us ‚ù§Ô∏è
Somebody: UH, another matpat rant. this is why i don't-
Me: BE QUIET! MatPat doesn't have so many rant videos, and I want to watch this without your twrrible interruptions!
(disclaimer, I am not a real CEO) Hey, this is like as if this is a company, and I am a CEO. ONE of my employees smokes an awful drug, and suddenly, BOOM, the whole company is downgraded.
You know on the outside Matt is just a goofy theorists, but on the inside he really cares about his community
unexpectedly warms my heart :,>
From 20:11 ... üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
0:41 "MA, HEY MA! MA! I'M A CAMEO IN A GAME THEORY VIDEO! ARE YOU PROUD OF ME YET?"
You helped me write an argumentative easy before!
Im not going to rant
Rants unknowingly for 20 minutes
Huuuuuuu I just need to cut in to say that Johnny Depp is innocent! His ex wife admitted that she lied about everything and now he's pressing charges against her! Lol
It sucks that gamer channels can't be official YouTube influencers üòê it's always the way though, society thinks certain types of people are bad in some way and often those are the people who are most interested in doing what's right for society and the planet. 

The problem with celebrities and accusations is you won't ever know what is true. Johnny Depp has been married a few times and it's only his last wife who has anything to say about him. So I don't believe it. You make a good point about celebrities in general though.
He just completely outed all of the media, that takes some courage. Taking over the fact that the media can destroy careers in days, stay safe matpat
Hey Mat, I recommend mentioning all members of TRG if you're gonna mention them individually. I think it's pretty shitty not to name all members of the group.
They are afraid of and don't want change. It's all apart of this  conspiracy of the major corporations who are seeing this change impact their investor profits. Change is hard it's even harder for companies with billions on the line in investments, if they want to keep that gravy train running they have to squash competition, and invest as little as possible into changing their market, because change doesn't reflect with immediate gains. Something their investors care quite a lot about, because it hurt their dividends or turnover profit. 

Thous these corporations have to come up with ways of make a quick profit, create false controversy, create a narrative, drive it home that these people are bad millennials,rural America, urban America, poor people, I could go on but dividing and conquering is the name of the game in our current capitalist system.   Your confusion is what they want, its harder to join hands to gather and fight back when your told your community has bad people in it or when your told there are other people you should fight first.
Wait matpat are you actually making the soap bars because I want them üòÇ
You go MatPat! So honest and so thorough. Thank youüëç
They hated matpat because he spoke the truth...
How is he this magical üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
By far one of the best kind of mic drops.. ever
You are a GreAT man!!!
And i am from india and pewdiepie is #1...
T-series sucks.

"Your favorite youtuber may be the start of an ideological pipeline that starts with memes and ends in neo-nazi chan boards."
Youtube hates the gaming channels because it wants to be TV.  Anything that would be out of place on network television is frowned upon.
OMG matpat preach, you changed my life when I was 8 I started watching your videos on fnaf I loved the comedy, and at that time I was suffering from the loss of my grandfather the one person who made my life worth living....then I found your channel a glimmer of hope you changed my life for the better. I am forever in your debt because your videos didn't just give me immense self-worth in myself they actually made me more intelligent if I said that I am fairly smart because of school that would be a lie it¬¥s because of you. Thank you so much for everything you have done to help me and countless others bless your soul and remember that you saved my life ^-^
Loved the This Is America point with the advertising bit on it. MatPat despite the ads on the said video, do know that if you do watch the video, that Donald Glover puts in a lot of references, (you have to be watching/listening closely to find/see/hear them) and there are even several videos on the references itself in case you missed or didn't understand them. That being said, since your video is pointing out a lot of quote on quote "issues" that Youtube has, I highly encourage you to watch the This Is America video just because I feel like with your way of thinking, it would lead to something even higher as the ever turning gear in your head works. 

As everyone knows, this issue with Youtube that you covered is just the tip of the iceburg and I'm sure that you could make plenty of videos discussing the many flaws that Youtube has as a whole but hey, we're not gonna go there right now. (Unless you wanna make that video(s) then by all means, go for it.) 

ANYWAYS, truly enjoy your videos. Keep up the good work.
Mat pat for public speaking award
cowbelly LETS GO BABY
MatPat is actually purple guy, he's just trying to cover it up

but hey



THAT'S JUST A THEORY
Wait wait wait you say people hate Logan and Jake Paul? HALLELUJAH IM NOT ALONE!!!!üòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòá
watch this video get demonitized
Matpat someone did sponser u. It was at the end of this video when a Facebook ad played
That Captain Eo T-shirt was on point ^^
No matter what others think about these, the undeniable fact is that MatPat is standing up for literally all the other Youtubers.


Respect +
why am I crying so hard rn??? MatPat you are so inspirational and brave and I‚Äôm proud to have been a theorist for years üò≠üò≠üíöüíö
you know , the media just wants to make youtubers look bad so much , they dont want any positive stuff from youtubers
Nice Captain Eo shirt
XD that mike drop at the end though
i really want this trending. it‚Äôs worth it.
i dont like traditional media, i support youtube, but the way you went about this by throwing shade at famous mainstream celebrities is not the way to go about it. ad-pocalypse is just happening because companies arent seeing returns. they‚Äôre cutting back on ad spending, youre taking wayy to personal. its just business.
The video has a great message. But his shirt is staring into my soul
So... He's telling me what the internet won't tell me about his channel? (because this is my favourite channel)
Matpat subscribers: Stands with Matpat
Matpat: Snaps*
(Pitchfork Appears)
Matpat: CHARGE
Subscribes: Runs through the media buildings pretty much the Rage Virus but with pitchforks
Dang I came for the laughs and instead left feeling bitter but also so INSANELY PROUD OF MAT, AND SEAN , AND ALL THE OTHER GAMERS!!! Seriously I actually got emotional watching this because obviously I knew about all of the charity(I was here during GTLIVES) but to see such a big and tangible number really hit home how giving Youtubers and especially gamers can be!!! Seeing Mark and Sean and supercarlinbrothers( heyyyyy brother) just made me so PROUD AND HONORED TO BE PART OF SUCH AN AMAZING COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS GT THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING! So thank you matpat. Truly and sincerely from the bottom of my heart thank you so much for showing just how great Youtuber, GAMER YOUTUBERS, can be. As well as thank you for just being you and being the voice us as a community need.
Y'all remember when a freaking sitting congress woman dropped in on Hbomberguy's charity stream?
Story time made me jump!
Matpat ive wanted to be a youtuber for a lilong time this video inspires me more than ever before
MAT PAT YOU'RE LITERALLY THE BEST (for telling us these stuff that needs to be told)
2019 is the year of passive aggressive matpat
gt live intro my depletion cowers in fear
The truth never gets to the top.. people are to easily offend. Really love your video and will support you wherever you go.
Boy, MatPat is the voice of the people <3
We were all thinking it. But the king has finally spoken it üëèüëèüëè
Advertisers destroyed with FACTS and LOGIC
Ngl Seeing MJ on your tshirt did make me cringe though
6:07 oh how much the truth hurts.

Edit: everything he said was true, oh how I got emotional especially with the Pewds part.
Matpat I get it it‚Äôs frustrating I get it but it‚Äôs because YouTube is getting much more popular than other platforms and I hate this two but apparently people want gamers to be depressed am I right gamers
yes for MONTAGE
This is the only time you can say this unironically 






GAMERS RISE UP
Time out for a second.  Johnny Depp has video proof that those accusations are false.
poof
wow  
i
im
like now wye
Can't film theory be in the top tier Youtubers since it does not cover gaming
I am totally fine with you ranting MatPat I do it all the time
Don‚Äôt worry Matpat you‚Äôre top tier in our hearts
Hey MatPat I'm just a long-time loyal theorist it may be my perception but there seems to be a lot of frustration and controversy that you have experienced recently. I bring that up just to say I appreciate your voice and presence on this platform. I hope however reads this will have a a little bit brighter of a day knowing they are a part of a community that holds a special place in someone's heart.
I love you Mat, especially when you dish out the hot truths. Never stop calling out the messed up double standards of our society. Never let these crimes to our platform go unnoticed. Keep dishing out the good vibes and the #CouchControversy
this is  a very pessimistic world that we live in
I'm very proud of the Destiny community with GuardianCon raising over $3million the past two years and encourage people to come past the streams this year cause it might beat 2018's record of $2.7million! (and of course Datto who now enjoys cosplay)
That was so much better than the thumbnail led me to believe
This video needs tens of millions of views! MatPat thank you for doing the hard work for the YouTube community as a whole.
Im crying of happiness right now
Beautiful video. It really sheds light on a problem I didn't know existed but now am angry about. The actions of the few tarnish the acts of the many. That is not right or acceptable. The stigma of the gaming community is incredibly inaccurate. Thank you for being the one to talk about this. I can think of no better person to do this video.
Is no one going to talk about his Michael Jackson Shirt
This better get on pew news


Over 200 likes? Damn I‚Äôm happy people agree
This should be on film theory
matpat is so well spoken honestly, i love him.
now we riot
Is this a reupload? I feel like ive seen this before.
Is it bad that I'm crying with happiness that we all stand together even though we watch diff channels?
Gamers, RISE UP
in the tabletop gaming scene Critical Role is awesome on the charity side
Youtube is probably shook rn üòÇ
Why isn't this video on trending rn??
6:01 I though Logan Paul WAS AdPocalypse 1.
6:31 I don't think you can qualify TearofGrace(far right side) as a "kid-friendly channel". Also, I see that self-plug in the top corners.
11:21 Sir, refer to him by his true title, "chuggaaconroy, the YouTube anti-toxin."
13:32 Should someone tell him that bid wars exist?
Shouldn't this be on file theroy
amazing job Matpat! you're an inspiration to me no matter what they say. know that will always be people who support you
Actually, Johnny Depp was the one being abused, but I know this is a bit old already.
I swear matpat is building a rebellion against the mass media and its freaking amazing lol its channels and people like matpat that make me wanna keep trying for my channel
I feel like you could do a podcast or something
I regret not watching this MUCH sooner. So worth the time I spent watching it.
Last five minutes or so was straight GOLD
Odd1sout was on the "fraction of a fraction!"
You are in the top tier status, in our opinions.
I'z the real the true minecraft diamond man 5000 the true minecrafter
We can expect this whole channel to get demonetized.
4:50 gamers truly are the most oppressed group.
i stop watching for a month and his hair is now purple-
Honestly, we need more people like MatPat in this world.
Gamers
It's time to rise up again
0:01 yes that is exactly what I am thinking
I would like the Game Theory soap
This vid was great but that Johnny Depp comment aged poorly
You know shit's about to go on when Matpat's on the couch
HELL YES IF YOUTUBE DOESN‚ÄôT PUT THIS ON TRENDING THEN I AM GOING TO LOSE. MY. MIND!
matpat i had a assignment  in class and i desided to bring this problem to light with my school community
i love how this video isnt monetised either, great job advertisers you cant take the truth!
Gaming is looked at as immature and childish (Gambino) lol sorry.
But seriously, in my opinion at least, it's a bias towards gaming in general. People don't take it seriously as an art form.
We should name the couch! 





I think it should be MatSat!
dude you just jumped the gun , i feel worried about your safety . they gonna come for you now you aren't safe .
But dantdm had a game video that got into the first spot on normal trending, and second in America(idk what it was in first)
You do great work Matt. Keep it up.
MatPat for president 2020
Youtubers are never taken seriously, that‚Äôs always been the problem.
Y'all do know he said "accused" about Depp right, he didn't say if he did or didn't lol
I like your shirt MatPat.
Theory soap confirmed
notice after you make this vido the ncaa and nfl are louseing ad providers nola no call
This is the purest form of Truth!
12:53 something like that happened at my school. 

Mini-story (idk what i've writted): An Indian man,  said some things about folding and cutting some papers (excuse my bAd english...) that transform in... ummm... wands. Everything for curiosity and fun. He also said that we could learn more if we buy a little book that was 10 lei/Ron, and all the money are going for homeless children from India.

Some of us would say it's fake, but I don't think that.
Such hypocrisy is essential to capitalism. Only by letting go of capitalism can we get real honesty and fairness.
I can‚Äôt understand a lot of what he is saying because he is using big words, but i agree. (Im just kidding, i understand a lot of it. üòÇüòÇ)
I love the way he ended it lolü§£
Matpat dropping fire on everyone and sounding  like a revolutionary in the process.


Nice.
Couch talks with MattPat are the best
Faith in Humanity restored, and lost... but ultimately restored again. Thanks MatPat
I don't like randomized group projects either.
Does your PR team were at work to publish this video?
Wait.... Is this video demonetized because it's speaking the truth...?

SHAME
"Couch on the background time " means one thing: "serious time"
In 14:53, you put emojis in china too. Despite YouTube being otherwise inaccessible unless you use a VPN :D
This makes me wish I wasn't broke as a joke. Then I would donate big buck to these youtuber charities. Moreover, I wish I had influence to sponsor these tubers that hold these fundraisers.
I'm blown away by the sincerity, the honesty, and the passion of this video.  It makes me wanna go find some of these people and join this community I've only been passively experiencing, as I use YouTube mostly for eduction and learning and not social connections.  This is a world I want to be a part of.
Why Matpat isn't Youtube's Negociation man? He is the best explaining things for brands.

Youtube could literally use this video to brag about their platform in front of all the negative fake news & stigmas about youtubers.
Johnny Depp is innocent
Annnnnnd there are no adds (I think we know why)
This needs to be posted everywhere and anywhere
Mid-tier influencer... damn that‚Äôs cold
"This isnt going to be another rant" 

Whoops! XD
'I know my place in this universe' ..I don't.
MatPat for top tier youtuber 2020
over 5,000 media groups disliked this video
Love this video soooo much....fyi, Johnny Depp was exonerated :-)
Lol, the news doesn't care about positive stories about youtubers? No, news organizations by and large don't care about positive news stories, period.
Johnny Depp was falsely accused by his ex wife, he has even evidence to back it up. He is in court about this now. Problems these days is that man are guilty until proven innocence, and even proven innocence still gets to be guilty.
Also they also put Brett Kavanaugh on supreme counsel and he is not a youtuber either!
This is something I posted to my Facebook page after watching this video (I wanted to do some research and learn a bit more about all of the analytics and how logical it is for people point fingers at YouTube):

"To every person in media (or otherwise) that has negative thoughts on YouTubers, and especially ones focused on gaming... your news outlets won't ever give as much to charity as these people who are supporting themselves- it's a fraction of a fraction that they feel they HAVE to do, whilst these small creators do it themselves because they want to with FAR less money. On top of that, those media networks go out of their way to find the worst things going on in society, whilst these people want to bring positivity to it.



I don't understand why people hang on to the major networks that just don't care about the true stories as much as the monetary gain- they'll say whatever YOU want to hear (or the exact opposite so that they get a rise out of people and attention) to keep viewership. Plus, as we all know and as MattPatt points out, again, they LOOK for bad press from the little guy to make themselves still look relevant. They're some of the most insecure media "creators" out there. If they embraced the positive sides of media, the world would be a better place, but that's not going to happen.



And, worse, they'll go to a platform that is their COMPETITION, and report on NOTHING but negative- the positive is ALWAYS ignored. Remember, YouTube is a platform where over 400 hours of media are uploaded every second (reference 1). Now, you hear about one or two small incidents every few weeks, correct? That's basically like saying someone in a population that is higher than of the State of Florida (about 21,000,000,000) (reference 2) or more than the individual populations of Sri Lanka, Romania, Chile, and the Netherlands is doing something wrong (reference 3). It's a bit ridiculous if you think about it from that perspective- you blame an entire platform for the errors of very, very few- 23,000,000 channels (reference 4).



Just think a bit about that....

Also, an interesting example of YouTube analytics in real-time:


The Game Theory video I was referencing:

 "
I almost criedüò≠
Matpat uploaded a video 21 minutes long about youtubers?
I love that you mentioned Games Done Quick in this video MatPat, as well as the many others in the gaming community doing so much good. 

My brother was one of the speedrunners at the event at this year‚Äôs Awesome Games Done Quick and I remember cheering when they passed the $2 million mark live!!! He will be there again for Summer Games Done Quick next month!!! So stoked and can‚Äôt wait!!!  

On a side note, I am a huge fan of your channel and thrilled to be subscribed. Keep up the amazing work!!
This is like the same thing with furries and otaku's....
My one question is, how did we go from full animation to 25 live action and 75 animation?
Love the micdrop
Thank you for this video Matpat. 

Hopefully the hypocrisy of advertisers comes to an end as more young people begin to work in advertisement agencies.
The sad thing is I have been seeing a lot about MatPat in the last couple weeks. Was it about this video not just pointing out hypocracy but showing so much good that is done on this platform? No it was that the kirby video was a bit off about something. 
People would rather talk about and hear about how MatPat messed up a theory that when he talked about all this. 
It does seem to be true. No one wants a positive story about YouTubers. 
As much as I do have my own varied opinions on MatPat I do acknowledge that he seems to be doing things in good intent. That he tries to be a good force for the platform. If you want to write him off as just that one dude who says Sonic is slow or Ness is Sans go ahead. But you'd be doing yourself a disservice to stay that ignorant on him.
The plural of apocalypse is apocalypses.
Call out the news organizations purposefully driving the advertisers away from the platform
Why would someone dislike this
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
I am freaking loving these videos even though they make me kinda sad.
TY this is amazing thank you MatPat!
When I saw Cory at 13:51 I literally closed my eyes and screamed in excitement
BeatEmUps raised 42,000 for charities that help with depression
Someone get this man on the trending page this instant!!
Tbh i was thinking since when have you had a purple streak in your hair
Damn, all because you got mid tier influencer status. Remind me not to diss MatPat.
Its ok matpat i love ranting and listening you always have my ears
says logan paul    only gets 3 ads in a 21 minute video
I raised 25 dollars for charity on my 24 hr stream
Thank you for helping us understand matpat thank you for bring this kinda stuff to light.
We still love you MatPat & Steph!!!
I'm no lawyer, but class action for discrimination anyone?
YESSS!!!! Very well said!
Even though I am not a YouTuber I support my fellow gamers..
3:01 What about Kevin?
Matpat spillin tea before the kettle finishes boiling water, dam son. Get the truth out there.
This was awesome and eyeopening....especially if you are considering becoming an influencer
RESPECT ‚úä
Dude. The math, lore, and science you've used in your theories have helped me through a lot in high school. I did an essay on Purple Guys sanity, (don't laugh), and I used your theories as a basis, and I got a really good score on the essay. 
You helped me learn genetics before I studied it in biology and chemistry.
Your math always helps expand my mind when I'm in Algebra.
So Mat, Steph, and everyone on the channel, I say this.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Am I the only one that sees the hypocrisy in his support of MJ?
oof  Michael Jackson shirt
HE MENTIONED MINILADD I'M SO HAPPY
i liked this video until he brought up johhny depp dont even love the guy but when evidence comes out that it was the other way around and he still brings it up smh. this video should have just been talking about how good youtube is not hown bad everyone else is
Mainstream hates that youtubers have a better more connected audience, than their mainstream media does.
That deng Hbomberguy stream was badass, tons of good speed running charity streams
Say what you will about Matt Patt but he is the only one that will tell you this kind of information. Thank you, Matt.
2:11 did anyone see that username on the bottom left corner? ‚ÄúSunshine and (F word or fallin)
Unfortunately, we live in a world where drama sells. Even though i feel like its a small minority of people that genuinely enjoy the drama stories, while the majority just doesnt care. Id love to hear more about youtubers in a positive light..
Sis: snapped
Tea: spilled
Opinion: his
Mat: pat
Game: 
Matpat ur my favorite out of the game theorists.
The couch is back. I was done gone shook dude
How much do you bet that this vid was demonized
I really appreciate this video because I agree with u completely. Not everyone can talk about this
This video was much needed and I'm happy you made this.


Please make this trend...
Suprised that youtube didn't take this vid down.
Sorry man I think I just got to use to your cut put photo head talking to me instead of just you, but I'm working on it... jk... kind of... üòÅ
Do u have something we don‚Äôt know
Its great and all, but people that need to hear that dont use that platform. Thats the whole issue, people who are sponsoring youtube dont use or understand youtube.
Edit: Also a thing that i want to point out is that, why do you take it as a offence? I mean that the gamers have special staff form google dedicated towards just gaming youtubers. Ofcourse you can look at it the salty way- "Hurr durr we are not top tier, youtube doesnt allow us to be the best, the very best cuz they have internal structure" or the positive way "they have a team dedicated to us, tailored just to gamers"
oh my lawd, Shane Dawson is looking right at me o_o
man you made me sad
PURPLE HAIR!!! I WANT ITT!!!!
Love the passive aggressive attitude
Wow well done, Matt, well done :)
Advertisers be like:" Oh crap he's onto us!"
13:51 eyyyyy!!! My boi cory out here being a good youtuber
Mainstream media needs to stop ripping on youtube.  As if the majority of them are better.
i love how all this happened because of a little sentence in a christmas letter from google
Dam I don‚Äôt really have emotions but I almost cried whatching this
I find it a little concerning that matt makes jokes to himself, by himself
I cried while watching this video
This is true I see so many news reports that say that you tubers who game are like 10 time less popular for doing ten times the work
Dude. This is the best video ever.
This looks like that old video that you uploaded a long time ago
Yes you did end up ranting but I watched the whole thing because I was engaged the whole time!
21:19 Yeah Boiii Drop that mic!
Advertisers just got Matpatted
This channel has literally been the only reason I have an A in physics. These videos make me want to study it and learn more about physics so I can better understand what you guys are talking about. I also love the theories that deal with psychology and culture. You reminded me of my passion for mental health and have helped me through the anxiety of figuring out my college majors.
This video is absolutely beautiful. And you gave so many statistics that I can now use whenever someone says that 'Youtubers are good for nothing', which is something I hear pretty often at my school.
So damn proud to be part of this community, and to be part of this platform. You're an amazing person, Matthew :D
Nah fam this ain't opinion these are cold FACTS
Been here since day 1 will be here till armaegaedon
9:15 Did I just hear "Transgender kids"?
"Kids" as in school kids?
"Transgender" as is hormone blockers?
So it's kids, that we wouldn't trust with a beer, taking hormone blockers, that permanently change their body?
1:46 - 1:49 i agree
Most oppressed group of em all GAMERS
Am I the only one who would buy theory soap? I would totally buy theory soap. Please make theory soap a thing
The johnny depp nonsense has been disproved. It was the other way around.
I literally want to send this video to everyone I know
This was sooo awesome to see
Ohhhhh man and just like that I love MatPat again
To everyone who disliked this video..shame on you
Oh my, would you look at the time. Yup, it's time to 
R I S E   U P   G A M E R S
preach! people should watch this
those articles are meant for the parents to prevent their kids to use youtube and watched their favorite youtubers that inspire and help them to do good. I agree that there are bad things you see in youtube but so as other platforms. People just can't accept that youtubers are getting bigger than traditional celebrities and their trying desperately to ruin youtube (idk if that's true, and if it is, it does not make sense) 
The reason I admire youtubers are bc they can do anything. They act, produce their own vid, THEY ARE TALENTED AF! and they help people, they inspire them to be themselves and follow their dreams. They deserve better.

edit: I haven't subscribe but after seeing this vid, I will RN! and I've seen some of his vid and I love the rant ones üòÇ
But Kayla your my favorite youtuber
i feel this rage, rather this frustration.
Youtubers are great!! üòä
matpat: this is not a rant.


me: uhuh
MatPat, you are incapable of angering me you always make sense, well mostly... glances at the biggest sin on the channel
Yo Darcy you did good
This is super silly .I used to feel super depressed about my pores and I saw a makeup tutorial on how to cover it up.It doesn't bother as much as it used to and I don't cover up it up because now I know it's normal.
The Johnny Depp thing didn‚Äôt age well...
We NEED to get this on pew news and get this video viral!
üòçlove the purple hairüòç
YouTubers for THE WIN
It‚Äôs just like Simon said: the dreams of those who have fallen, the dreams of those how follow, They weave into a double helix üß¨ drilling a path towards tomorrow!
We will never never not like you promise
The traditional media will never accept us even after they're buried and no longer relevant, it'll be an interesting transition these next few years as the digital spaces completely dwarf traditional and they have to evolve or be destroyed, most are kicking and screaming instead of making changes, and unfortunately they're trying to bring YouTube down with them.... Keep fighting the good fight MatPat! We can make a difference together.
Seriously though agreement to terms and conditions on platforms that use media can be seen as giving up your free speech the same way that signing into debt can take away your sense of prosperity, with student loans being one of the the biggest among them. Willingly.
Matpat we can see that you're hurting, it's straight evil what they're doing for the almighty dollar. You're amazing and we're ready to go to war for you!!
Wait '' SPIEL'', is MatPat Irish?
Damn....
I'm just wondering if YouTube's gonna demonitize this video.
5,100 employees of cable news downvoted this video.
K_E_E_P__T_H_E_P_U_R_P_L_E__H_A_I_R_P_L_E_Z
HEY GUYS! Welcome to 'Couch Theory'!
But that's just a theory? Or are we done with the theories and have moved on to facts üíØüíØüíØüíØ
Media hates YouTube because it takes views away from all other forms of media.
Everyone seems to have their place in the YouTube family and MatPat is def giving me the "Activist protective cousin who will kick down your door for messing with his family" vibes
i‚Äôm so happy you made this video
Nice Michael Jackson Shirt!
lol that michael jackson shirt
one bad youtuber does nothing:
all of YouTube: DEMONITIZED
They are always listening, like Scott Cawthon when you finally figured out fnaf
This made me feel something. Wow this was good. That passion is what gets me. It‚Äôs so sincere I couldn‚Äôt look away.
Preach MatPat!!!
This brought me to tears. Matpat, you truly have done a wonderful thing again. You speaking the truth for the behalf of the gaming community is a huge deal because this isn‚Äôt what YouTube wants us to know. 

Keep on doing what you do, Matpat.
The media doesnt want positive news stories, PERIOD
350k for transgender.....children....hold up.
Oof. This did not age very well.
LOVE THE PURPLE HAIR
Good for you for speaking out on this, Matt. Somebody needs to.
Ironically YouTube wont put this in trending lol
He is slowly turning into Shane dawon
I respect mattpat
This made my day
Now I wish this was the video that made me subscribe
Matpat: I'm not gonna rant today.
Matpat: rants for a while using some smooth passive-aggressive quips
Matpat: leaves
Matpat: Oh wait... I did exactly what I didn't want to do. Oh well, guess I'll try to fix it now with this nice little message.
Pretty good unintentional humor there. This is one of the reasons why I like this channel. Keep making those good videos as long as you can.
When the biggest german youtuber gets some screen time, but is representing only a small fraction of what he has done compared to other events that I forgot the names of.
I don't know if 800.000‚Ç¨ is the biggest number there, but the LeFloid's one must have gotten a lot.
WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA
Can you create a theory about Uncharted?
6:31 Hey y‚Äôall Scott here
"That's just an opinion, my opinion."
Wow that was great.
Your inspiring me  about being inspired
I get your point
Keep preaching brother
Matpat throwing shade is the best matpat
Matt: Ends video with Mic Drops
Internet: Applauses
Explains why only two ads
but I want fictional stories
I agree completely
I only paid attention to the mj shirt
I have never seen a video that talks about YouTube Gamers and online creators in general in a more positive light. I‚Äôm glad people can see the good in people that I have looked up to for the longest time. You couldn‚Äôt have worded it more perfectly. I‚Äôm glad people are finally speaking up about this.
Teenage years are a bit sporadic in the sense of interests and hobbies and YouTube has always been there for me, brands come on man, YouTube is there for everyone and used by everyone
actually I like the hair
RantPat is best Pat change my mind-
Youtube needs to promote this to the moon
Mainstream media is trying to shut down YouTubers because they are scared.
Amazing video, seriously
This almost Made me cry
Actually thought the purple hair had something to do with dissing Ally Bank
This is straight up proof that we gamers are oppressed
drops mic walks away rushes back in to apologize for ranting
So he used the popularity of his videos covering the fall of that one company to make a series of other videos in the same style, i am not surprised, and would do the same but ughhhh
I'm fine with the hair
Matpat rocking the M.J. shirt
I'm not crying


you are
MatPat throwing shade on The Oscars and NFL is giving me life
üò≠ the feels
Is that Michel Jackson I thought he was a petifiel
#TheTruthTheorists
I agree with you
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna rant.‚Äù

They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
This is so good!
I Learned math from youuuu
that's it i am making this a speech
It‚Äôs all about that RESPECT
Finally, a human on this platform.
Hell yeah, Pewd... I mean, MatPat!!! :v
this video should have gotten more attention (more views)
i love the hint of purple
MatPat is honestly my number one favorite YouTuber because of his dedication to the platform and trying to push others to make it the best it can be.  He very clearly cares about this, and he tries to lead by example.


You go, man.  You're #1 in my book.  And I know that a 23 year old girl from the Southern US doesn't have an opinion that carries much weight, but every little bit counts, right?
Wow Mat pat is losing his patience. Good. RANT AWAY
good points and good video. but i hate to be that guy who points out that this is a rant despite you saying otherwise. still great keep doing this.
PREACHHHHHHH!!!!! ‚ÄºÔ∏èüîäüéâüëèüëèüëè
Somehow got two ads on this video even though I have YouTube premium. Confused
MatPat, ur a really good guy. U just moved my heart with this motivational video. I want to thank u for doing these thing but anything I do won‚Äôt be enough. I just hope u don‚Äôt stop and u get heard by the world one day. Thank You.
YouTube has left the chat
Also a word about Jonny Depp - Some new evidence surfaced recently that actually proves his wife was the abuser, (which take it as you will or look deeper into it- I didn't really follow the case too much I just know that there was some strange stuff going on) But still, if it is true, thats a major Hollywood actress getting away with some serious stuff because of her hot body, race,  and money.
One of the reasons as to why I gave making videos a try was because I seen how other creators on the platform liked doing it and I had a vision in my head saying "Hmm, I should try this. I may like it." I may not upload everyday and have recently fallen way behind on getting any content out, but I kick at myself a little knowing that I should set aside a little time in my life to actually work hard and foster a community of my own.
Possibly one of the things that I like about this platform is that I can be myself when I make my content. Even though it sometimes is a little anxiety-inducing to sit down in front of the camera and game, I still enjoy it as I know that some people will like it, and heck, maybe even be inspired themselves. I myself have overcome a few mental barriers to try this and I found out that I do enjoy it.
great vid, but why purple hair
Goddammit MatPat, we love you so much. You're both intelligent, and incredibly nice. Thanks for showing us the truth man, you're frickin awesome, and you better keep makin videos for a while. Also, Skyrim Lore video? No?
MatPat enlightening everyone about how much gamers do and how much they give back. CAN WE SERIOUSLY GET A CHARITY and GAMERS highlight VERSUS JUST NINJA AND STUPID FORTNITE DANCES to reflect gaming?
At 20:20 He just got so pissed lmao
I watched why the mine craft planet isn't square and I had a bingo challenge for school and that was if science wasn't a problem what planet would we live on and since it does exist I just wrote why flat earthers are dumb and why superman can fly, thank you, matpatüò¢üòÄ
You tell em Matt, I hope you can change things around here.
You are marking a differentiations on this platform mat pat
Gamers being oppressed isn‚Äôt JUST a meme anymore. üò®üòÆ
Stay strong mat pat you‚Äôve bin through so much
Of course, there are no news outlets covering this.
love you matpat
Why would 5 thousand people dislike and if it‚Äôs because the meme
Bro someone in my class said that Youtube is educational and they mentioned your channel. See, this is proof that you are a teacher.
11m is mid tier? okay youtube
we're nano tier
#Demonitizedbytruth
Why does matpat look's like he's not there?ü§î is it vidiocamera
I really love videos like this  




1 informing 
2 entertaining
3 change of pace 

feels natural
Just noticed I wasn‚Äôt subscribed yet. MatPat never seems deliver a bust of a video, always very informative and shines a lot of light on current events. 
I also see the TeamFourStar logo in there, so that‚Äôs really cool to see them getting noticed by someone.
I say we up vote and share until Youtube can't ignore it.
Matpat: NoahJ helped out St Judes
CoD Zombies Youtubers in EE4C: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?
For some reason this reminded me of the I have a dream speech
Everything‚Äôs all fun and games until Mat sits on the couch
Quick question is matt a leftist???
And that's the tea,
Yes YES football is over I've won. Yes!
It's cool to see Super Carlin Bros. mentioned here because I actually kinda knew Tyler before he started his YouTube career.
The thumb nail made it look like a theory. Well played
Gamers rise up
You are truly inspirational.  Sometimes I fill the role of therapist among my friends. But watching these videos is like therapy to me. I will always be grateful for your videos.  They are fun and educative at the same time so thank you and I wish you well
I just really appreciate MatPat's effort in this channel: He takes the time and effort to do all this research purely for OUR entertainment. Plus he makes the effort to talk about important issues, despite the fact it may not get as many views.
Gamers and animators should be redeemed on youtube
You think your only a tiny bit educational and helpful
You
Helped me with math
Taught me tons of Newton‚Äôs laws
And so much other things
So give mat pats vid a like to make him happy
If you see this reply and if I get a reply from u mat pat it would make my day
Edit; thanks for the likes
MatPat: I wish I could be the high tier
Gamers rise up
You are our voice.
at 11 million you are mid tier omg
"nobody like positive YouTube stories"
They should like this one then
hi!!!
It's kind of a shame I never even knew about this channel until you did the videos about Defy media and Ally bank. I always intend to just watch a bit, but somehow get through all 20+ minutes and find myself feeling a lot more informed. This video is no exception. Thanks for laying things out as they are.
OMG üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üôÇüôÇ
This was inspiring
Who needs school when u have MatPat
Gee it's almost like the people who don't give back purposefully control the media to spin us who do give back into lesser people because if we had a voice they'd be run out of town.
A lot of topics in the video are dated.. the shirt too.. oof
Is this the real YouTube Rewind? I think it might be.
American football tho*. Football ( the beautiful game) is totally different from that rugby wanna be's with pads .
21:16 now matpat isn‚Äôt supposed to give his opinion
that was pretty good
This is what happens when you don't protect the fringe. You become the fringe.
Hey. Johnny Depp was clearers of the abuse allegations. Matt please get your facts straight, let‚Äôs not bring the hate on him back.
Gamers are oppressed. Video summarized.
A smaller channel, jaiden animations, donated 1000$ to a bird rescue
I agree with you.
This IS the best YouTube video. And that‚Äôs cause it focuses on everyone else that focuses on the less fortunate, not themselves.
cant wait till mat pat is number 1
I agree with mat
here's matpat sitting on his couch again... lemme grab my diet coke
Wtf jack played apex?
MatPat MatPat Mat Pat...dang I can't get that out of my head for some reason
This is the best video I‚Äôve watched EVER!!!
9:14
ahhh that's gross
no wonder you tube hates us XD
MatPat seems like the only person with a brain in these troubled times.
Matt Patt doesn't spill the tea he throws the kettle across the room.
I appreciate your points and agree with many of them. I do want to point out however that the ‚Äúsocial change‚Äù being promoted is not change that is appreciated by many of these companies consumers.
Isn‚Äôt this a Film Theory?
Share this video with everyone you know.
R. Kelly on CBS has 790k views and it's at the top of trending yet this video has 1.5 million and isn't anywhere to be found
I believe that YouTubers make a serious impact on the world. Although they get a lot of crap for it some of them make the greatest impact on children Which i will always support them.
Mighty car mods are ambassadors for a childrens charity as well
That wasn‚Äôt a mic drop. That was a full on mic slam.
CORY!!!! THE SAMURAI OUT HERE!!!!
The 3k dislikes were the news-media groups
ON TOP FOOD HAIN DONT STOP NEW GAME
I feel like Mr. Beast was a little misrepresented in the beginning cause he‚Äôs donated significantly more money than what was referenced
gamers rise up
MatPat is such a good speaker.
Wow, this video is so powerful. MatPat truly put his soul and effort in there.
Who seen Daniel samber some where
Is this the first time Matt Patt has got this mad
i feel like it had to do with politics if your right wing or left wing and it seems that the gaming community is always tied in with the right wing.
;(((
MatPat:
"Why Can't I Be A Top-Tier Channel"
YouTube:
"Well, First Of All, The YouTube Algorithm, Also, You're A Gamer"
Definitely a huge issue with the internet rn thanks for shedding light upon this issue matt
Mat you became Superman by the end of the video. Look at your hair in the end. In broad sense; This video was about bringing "hope" to new youtubers so Superman theme checks out. Respect your bravado!
9:20 transgender KIDS? WTF
11:16 Oh yeah ! Zerator and a lot of French youtubers and streamers did a stream during a whole weekend and (I am not sure about this but I think it's that) they raised 1 million euros for doctors without borders ! (And the guy at 11:16 is MisterMV, he is really funny !)
This is the best video I've ever watched. I feel really proud to be a part of such amazing communities.

Most of the Youtubers/YouTube Gamers are some of the best human beings on Earth and they truly make the world a better place...
it's always listening
I dont know if leading with the creator that donates in support of child genital mutilation was really the best tactic.
Will you be doing a dying your hair for charity event this year?
What happened to making talk therapy i mean Theory
Great video and analysis, it's absurd how poorly portrayed Youtubers are by the media, just so they can get their juicy little clicks and stir up controversy for the sake of profit. Spread this video around people.
6:31 that moment when ya boy Scott the woz gets in a game theory episode
matpat the truth revealer
Can I like hit the thumbs up button 1mil times?
So how do I become part of the angry mob that calls out hypocrisy in the advertisers?
Every YouTuber needs to stand up now this is not right       Matpat is completely right but we need more people to stand by him to let his voice reach them  he shouldn‚Äôt have to go in to this alone
Aaaand this video has just been demonitized.
I am a content creator on here as well.
I have given money but behind the scenes.
I mean it was only $175 to a Portland Animal shelter here but I raised it while at a convention at a hotel raising that money with my pinball machine where the con goers got some entertainment while the charity got every quarter made from the game.
I am also going to do it again this year and hope that it will raise even more for the animal shelter which the convention will be coming up here in May 24-26th.
I believe I did do a short video last year when I had the pin there. :)
I'm cryin'
Im about to cry its so sad
12:04 - This is so sad. Media hates him. Youtube hates him despite being the number 1 most subscribed by FAR. Instead of protecting your most influential Youtuber, they kept him out of Youtube Rewind, cancelling his "Scare Pewdiepie Season 2" despite it being completed. Youtube left Felix in the dirt and they still continue to do so. This is actually ridiculous. 



When will Youtube realize their mistakes?
Thanks mate
You look like Pewdiepie
It's only a matter of time before the suits see the money in gaming.
THE MIC DROP! MATPAT!!
I know Youtube can see this, I just hope they start to understand
MatPat for president!!
Meanwhile, what does the government do to the charitable money that has to go ‚Äúlegal procedures‚Äù before distribution???
It would have been perfect if this was a video with an ad.
I love this video, and I will hold onto these numbers for when I talk to my mom about YouTube.
The worlds‚Äô supply of tea is self imploding with the amount Matt is spilling.
Damnit MatPat, ya got me in the feels again.
Matpat...S N A P P E D
TO EVERYONE! [VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE] ‚ô°‚ô•‚ô°‚ô•‚ô°
 Wow. Honestly, this video is so important, so relevant, and so inspirational that I think we all need to step back for a moment, look at this picture, and come up with ways to fix it. It's time that we fix a broken system. Advertising things that make other people look bad is not helpful. Pinning a bad name on content creators, especially one category of them, is not uniting us as a community. It's tearing us apart. We can't let every bad thing someone major on the internet does take over news reels. For once, can we put a positive, empowering story on the headlines? There are people who come to YouTube for support and security and as a safe place, a sanctuary. We can't let the rest of the media cherry-pick the awful mistakes creators make and leave out what they did to fix it. When Logan Paul raised one million dollars toward suicide prevention after what happened with the Suicide Forest video, that is what should have been on the home page of YouTube. The feud between T-Series and Pewdiepie should have been the background of the money Felix raised towards the very people he was being pitted against.
All of you, it's time to raise some awareness for a new point of view. We can all unanimously agree that creators give more than they take, and we should showcase that giving. That hard work, that effort, should be brought to attention. Bring positive news to the media. Thank you so much for reading this very long message. I love you all, and you should believe it. Spread the word. 
This video is perfect
MatPat.exe has stopped working.


He‚Äôs so passive aggressive and sassy, he‚Äôs broken out a little bit of rage now. He cannot be stopped.
Might need to put an old disclaimer on that johnny depp bit there
mat that hair is so amazing it just... what rant
That wasn't an opinion.. it was the straight up TRUTH.
Your head looks bigger than it should...
I bet you 1000$ this is going on pew news
Give this man a medal!
Matpat for president 2020 wooooooh
ATTENTION EVERYONE! MATPAT IS ON THE COUCH: IT'S RANT TIME!
I know I am super late but this channel is the reason I stay optimistic all the time so MatPat if you read this from the bottom of my heart thank you
I love your rants! keep ranting and telling it how it is MatPat!
im crying D;
You are one of the you tubers that keep me up at night thinking about life and this is something we need to get this out to people and support this
That was fantastic
cough cough logan paul cough cough
So you're saying gamers are LITERALLY oppressed... GAMERS RISE UP!
that mic drop tho lmao
i love chuggaaconroy
MatPat is ANGRY
I wished Matt pat worked in YouTube....  Sigh...
It‚Äôs simple. Traditional media and advertisers are teaming up against new media because it threatens their business. TV is failing and rather than adapting and taking the high road, traditional media demonizes a platform like YouTube and encourages traditional advertisers to stay with them. That‚Äôs why you only ever see mobile game or tiktok ads on YouTube anymore. Sure something larger pops up here and there, but that‚Äôs usually only on trending videos by a company. 

It‚Äôs a cowardice defense mechanism they have came up with and it‚Äôs absolutely sickening. The worst part is how YouTube buckled the first time and now it‚Äôs a tactic they know that works.

Remember when the adpocalypse first happened and Pepsi was one of the most vocal companies to pull their ads from YouTube but a week later released an extremely controversial video cashing in on the racial tensions between American police and African Americans after multiple police shootings? Yeah, hypocrisy at its finest.

It happened then, it will happen now unless YouTube learns to promote a video like this and stand up for itself.
5:50 not a rant huh?
Amen man!
Not gonna lie this made me shed a tear
YOU FRICKIN FRICKS. WHEN WILL YOU LEARN. THAT YOU ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!!!!!!!!!
God damnit mattpat why you gotta be so wholesome
So Inspirational
This made me wanna make a channel. I just to see a child smile. üò¢
Hey matpat I know this is just recent news but i think you have to update that whole part about Johnny Depp cause what happened with depp is just accusations but Depp just came out with videos of his wife beating him and abusing him. I dunno just doesnt sit right with me that part is there.
And Pewdiepie got a shout out before the mosque attack ...
The problem isn't advertisers.  The problem is the dinosaurs of traditional media who are ready to pounce on any story that could hurt YouTube, online influencers, and social media platforms that threaten their existence.  Advertisers could care less about what negative/positive things happen on YouTube, so long as it doesn't hurt their brand image.  So if you want to change advertisers' minds, you have to change traditional media; and good luck with that.
My mom loves it when I watch you because she says you‚Äôre a good role model
I want to buy a jacket like that
damn he drop the mic
MatPat really is the internet‚Äôs dad.
Did my thumb slip, or was this the secret link from Philip DeFranco?
6:32 hey john tron
I like u purple hair.
This is so important
YESSSSSS DRAG THEM MEDIA CREEPOSSSS
Matpat is not a force to be messed with, and now you've pissed him off...
Of it makes any difference there were ads on your video
I love his purple hair
üëçüèº nice rant
I feel u kid and I've supported all of these people(youtubers (gamers)) and now it just makes me mad but it won't change nothing ever changes
The "gamers aren't high tier" mentality probably explains why Rewind 2018 was so terrible. I mostly watch gaming channels so seeing a bunch of strangers in the Rewind was really off.
Are these videos scripted?
Wait! Vsauce3 isn't MatPat?
I think the reason they pull out is to get better deals for the ads from YouTube
Well said, damn.
Just make a Mat Pat's Opinion channel already.
Thinking that this is gonna be taken down  by copyright making me be like very angry
I stand by his statement.
Didn‚Äôt you never do the second part of the fnaf timeline?!
To everyone getting on Matt's case about Johnny Depp: He wasn't saying that Johnny Depp was guilty, he was saying that there were accusations of against him that didn't result in corporations pulling all their support, whereas a single tiny problematic video on one single channel is enough for corporations to pull ALL THE ADS, so there's a double standard at play since they clearly don't care about their ads appearing alongside problematic content if they're willing to let any allegation slide everywhere except for YouTube.
The media can't control Youtubers, so they must discredit and disparage them. Easy see-through bullshit. Hopefully the younger generation recognizes this and turns away from traditional corrupt corporate media.
This video has been demonetized.
Ur cool, good job
You had to put pewds there in Odd1sout AHHHHüëø
The clickbait looks like pll lmao
Hello Internet,
Welcome to
RANT THEORY
the show that makes rants interesting
this is why I give my money to my favorite youtubers directly, because they are amazing and deserve to be appreciated as I, the consumer of their product, see fit. Not whatever YouTube thinks will help they stay out of trouble with brands. Because nothing will satisfy those big brands when it comes to YouTube and its creators
But it's just theory an artist theory
Confermed matpat is no longer barney
I think the companys took ads down just want to look pure by taking ads down and when they come back they can pay less for ads hmmmmm?
Media:
Reality can be whatever I want
also, sHADE MATPAT
3:13 That is me when I tell a joke to my friends and they just stare at me like I'm a lunatic
The one thing I‚Äôll say about advertisers fleeing YT is that nowadays advertisers aren‚Äôt staying away for long. In the CP controversy, I think they were gone maybe a week? Then they all came back so... Idk
as im watching this jacksepticeye is literally doing a charity stream
I feel like im gonna cry because everytime Matpat tells a story he puts emotions in those words and those words are inspiring.
You and your conpiracy face
Shoutout Chuggaaconroy
Mid tier influencer. Influencer?  Not content creator, or channel etc. This is interesting verbiage. In Youtubes eyes your worth as a channel isn't tied to the views you get, it's tied to the demographic you reach out to, and that demographics worth is based on the ads they view and the things they buy. It's pretty clear that they don't have too much respect for gaming channels (or the audience they reach), since there is a special exception to keeping them out of the "top tier", so maybe we just don't have enough money, or the right kind of money to be considered worthy. 

But I think that's only part of the problem.

The other half is Old Media. We are kind of in the middle of a war between the "Old Media" (Traditional News stations like CNN or Fox, cable companies like Comcast, Disney and other large media etc) and the "New Media" (Independent news, content creators such as let's players, independently created cartoons, learning channels, etc). There is nothing Newsweek or the like love more than a tasty bit of youtuber hate, because it helps drive eyeballs to their site and away from Youtube.  

But they are really targeting the advertisers, trying to convince them that their ads have a high chance of ending up on something distasteful, so they blow these issues up as much as possible.  You are competing for ad revenue, and their tactic is to scare advertisers away from the "mid tier" channels, which collectively probably have 100's of millions of subscribers.  They know that negative press is going to get a very strong reaction, and therefore views and money will shift, while positive press isn't the same driver.  

I think this causes entire communities to become whipping boys when one person acts like a fool.  It gives a reason for the media to hate, Youtube gets to crack down, and if some mid tier channels they care nothing about get hurt or disappear it doesn't matter because they need to look like they are trying to do something about it.  

Is it the fault of the people buying ad placements?  Yes, some desk jockey on Youtube watches 2 Logan Paul videos and says "Woah this guy has a lot of subscribers, we can reach a large dudebro audience!"/buys all the ad space/  "Oops he said something stupid YOUTUBERS ARE TERRIBLE!!!1!"  

But the media is taking up the torch and attacking you with intent, because Youtube is a threat to them.  You mentioned a double standard?  It exists because you aren't under their control and profiting them, you are rising up and out competing them.  They are afraid, and they should be.
there is no ad here ‚Ä¶...I wonder why
Matpat should be CEO of the world
Whats happened next
Who were the 5k people that disliked this.
Passionate MatPat expresses passion ding sin # -299
Is there no french person  who told you about the Zevent wich raised 1 million euros for doctors without border? Not too important but still merited a small word imo
Matpat should be a lawyer
I meek tabbes
I have to say... You taking a political stance... Hurts a LOT of people. 
These days, too many YouTubers in the West wing Left n‚Äô Right for the sake of their wallets, and NOT because they care about their viewers, but rather, the profits generated from them.
My only question shall be this: What side did you take, GT?
Be it you or others that may answer this, but I can only tell this small portion of the internet ONE thing...
Your American and British politics... Have become barbarian to the eyes of the world.
(Edit: The fact that you try to bring to the table the GOOD things about YouTube is fantastic!)
Wait is that Micheal Jackson?
It's just an opinion
My opinion
YouTube has a HUGE influence.
Honestly people watch YouTube more than television nowadays. That‚Äôs why I feel advertisers care so much. Is it right? Hell no but they still think that way.
YouTube cures my headaches
MIC DROP
Other big channel should help this video to reach more people. 
@pewdiepie please
Can the couch sessions become like another section of the theory logo...? I‚Äôm dying for the other two pegs to be filled in
Dont worry Mat, I'll listen to any of your rants cause to be honest, I think they're pretty interesting.
Love ya! Yeah they are super hypocrites lol I think what they really want is control
i got tingles at the end there
No keep the Coker hair
Good message. could have titled the video better though
Disney pulled their ads?
Remember first rule of the internet is never read the comments.
Wreck it Ralph 2
Can I get an AMEN?
You know, when im older, ima do anything i can to help this kind of thing stop. I will do all i can.
Boom! Big Shaq
Mat Pat Back Patter.
Why isn‚Äôt this on the trending page... never mind, forgot it was 2019
Bro you forgot the Jingle jam, smh.
I totally agree, however you've only seen half of the iceberg.

Many smaller youtubers have way less subscribers than they deserve (not talking about me, that would be wrong) for their work.
Even though they don't take any gifts, donations or revenue by ads many of them donate their own money.


Youtube already played terrible games with smaller youtubers. Many of these small youtubers (that donate even though they don't have any kind of revenue from it) are constantly ignored by the entire community (not talking about me, again. I'm talking about smaller youtubers that are completely ignored)

Just to make some examples of games youtube started playing with smaller youtubers (some of those happened to me too)
- If a society claims your video, you can't do anything but accept it even if it's their mistake and the entire video is all your stuff (let's say a vlog without music or video pieces by others
- Many small youtubers lost subscribers without the subscribers' decision to unsubscribe
- Subscribed (with bell activated) get notified about livestreams 6 hours (or even days!) after the beginning of the livestream
- Subscribed (with bell activated) don't even get notified by youtube about new uploads
- Some youtubers don't even show up if you search for some of their videos!
- You just can't be watched by the country that has the language of your video (for example some smaller youtubers that make french videos can't be watched by french people)
üôÑ so touching
O:O:O
YouTube blame the creators for the bad reputation but they make YouTube rewind XD
Stupid double standards
Beacarefull or YouTube might take down your channel for hate speech because of political correctness because free speech doesn't exist anymore
not gonna lie, sometimes i dont like matpat but i think its safe to say we all want to defend the real youtube, the youtube that inspires people to do better things in life, the youtube that has given people who had no goals in life to  start doing something about it. and also to save youtube for aspiring content creators that want to join in the positive way of sharing and contributing to their communities
There's such a thing as bad giving.
Woah at first I thought he was about to throw shade to PewDiePie
a lot of things on yt has preveted me from commited suicide
Okay... I'll admit, this video wasn't bad.
it is simple, the old media is fighting the new, becouse the new is kill the old
Guys......I think we have our new president.
MatPat for President 2020. screw everyone else.
I think one of the biggest problems with the way advertisers see the platform is that they think that most viewers are also creators, and that when a really popular person makes a mistake then that means that those who follow him will make a similar mistake and bring the platform down. Which is stupid, but they're not getting paid to be smart and think on their own of course, they run on a collective dumb mind.

About the fairly recent charity trend : I agree with Mat. It doesn't matter if you're doing it for your image or for genuine generosity, because either way the money will help those in need, and in that case it's the action that counts, not the thought. Sure, it might works as a trend that could potentially fade out, but in the meantime it's still doing more good than most of those celebrities that don't even care about people in need. I think that this mindset is possible because a lot of Youtube gamers started with nothing but their hopes and dreams, and they know what it means to be in need of help. Once they reach a point where they don't need to keep the money to themselves, they aren't driven by the desire to become more and more rich, but by the desire to help others fulfill their dreams just like they did. I'm not of course speaking for the whole community, and there are some lone wolves that don't have the same mindset, but it's just a fragment of what the Youtube community is, and what they're capable of. 

The advertisers don't see the potential, they just look at the surface and if they see even the slightest wave they freak out, afraid of sinking, while forgetting that they basically sit in a luxurious boat that would be hard to sink. Beneath that surface, lies a whole world full of beauty, emotions and life. The sharks and the whales aren't all that bad, and if a fish disrupts the harmony they will be punished by the rest of the ocean quicker than if a fisherman caught them. Sure, the sea isn't always blue, but it doesn't mean that it's filled with monsters. 

And finally, MatPat, know that your videos helped me a lot. I may have discovered your channel after leaving school, but it helped me develop my mind to a point where I don't simply accept things as they are, but instead won't hesitate to do some research in order to understand them. I've learned about things that I didn't even know interested me and the way you enjoy games over on GTLive, sometimes getting excited like a little kid is amazing. Keep that up for as long as you wish.
14:35 nooooo not mark :(
nice job MatPat
Gamers are so oppressed smh
Proof that gamers are oppressed in our society
Keep your hair purple
Companies who pull their advertisements from a platform for social change are most likely scared of what the changes mean, and will die like telegram companies died with the spread of telephones. Or like old media, including television and print, is dying with the growth of the internet.

They‚Äôre at the end of their rope, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre making a last ditch effort to destroy this platform in hopes that it‚Äôll allow them to survive a little longer, despite technology and time not being on their sides. A common case of relics trying to be relevant against the tide of progress.
WE LOVE PAPA PAT. YES.YES. HONESTLY YOU ARE THE BEST
Gamers are oppressed rise up
What a fantastic video! Thanks for shedding light on all these positive campaigns and efforts by YouTubers around the world. I am in the "worst of the worst" position, as I'm not just a GAMING YouTuber....but a MOBILE Gaming YouTuber. (oof!). And yet, even within our community there is SO much good done for those less fortunate, global charities, and even our peers in the mobile eco-system. Thanks for continuing to carry the torch for YouTubers -- whether it be shedding light on philanthropic efforts like today, or making people aware of dangers to creators, such as MCNs. It's all very much appreciated. Cheers MatPat!
I can't believe how long it took me to actually watch this video.
Youtube: Slight Child predator scheme
Advertisers: Pulls advertisements
MatPat: Exposes literally the biggest companies for brain damage causes, domestic abuse, prostitution, trafficking, and sex tapes
Advertisers: This? This is okay.
I love the purple chunk
You know that we all have that one freind
this was in my recommended. i'm so glad i clicked.
I'd guess that the distinction between top tier influencers and gaming is because regardless of how popular a gaming channel is it isn't going to be as good at shilling products as a lifestyle channel.
3:24 more like gluegle
Daamnnn, Matpat is on a roll.
inb4 the hate for Micheal Jackson on his shirt
hey, my comment got it's first like!








wait, why is it blue?
4:15 who says you aren't at the tier where they care enough about you to tell you what they really think of you
and they said nobody cares about good stories
PREACH MatPat!
we need this to be number one on trending
Did anyone notice that there are no ad's on this video



Stupid YouTube
Meen
Matpat popped off
When Matpat said story time, I thought we have to listen to when little red riding hood met Youtube.
The real question is not now when it's here
Its crazy that I can learn so much more from a 21 minute YouTube video than a 1 and 1/2 hour school class.
Most oppressed group
Its alright matpat I love these kind of videos I want to hear these story‚Äôs it‚Äôs the only way they will get out
This is so important
This almost made me cry at the, we have saved lives, part
Matpat: "bad joke lol"
Me: clap & a half love it XD
oh honey, companies are made of hypocrisy.
is it just me or is he getting closer to the camera
Where can I buy that shirt
Couldn't of said it better  myself
Conclusion: GIVE PEWDS HIS SHOW BACK!
interesting
Am I the only one that saw matpats maichael jackson
4:58 what a society we live in.
why was this on game theory and not film theory
Matt just create another channel where u just sit on a couch and talk
üëè
YouTube is crupted
Now thats a video each of us should share
FINNALLY!
This is honestly one of the best videos I‚Äôve ever watched
Ooooooo gettem' MattPatt!
I'm starting a petition for YouTubers to stop dying strands of their hair for attention. It began with Arin Hanson, threaded to Markiplier and Jacksepticeye, AND IT MUST END WITH MATPAT.

STOP THIS
Thank you Matpat
GoldGlove #forthekids
RISE UP GAMERS, Break the shackles of oppression!
oh my god, your tone is so annoying. calm down please
Fire!
Wow...
Then what aren‚Äôt you telling me? You‚Äôre my favourite channel!
The man's wearing a Michael Jackson shirt we must trust
Same with you
mappap ANGEY
Gamers are oppressed
YouTube‚Äôs to scared to put it on trending cuz they don‚Äôt want to get EXPOSED
I need this played in every board room in the industry.
There's also the Mindcrack Marathon and KurtJMac's Far Lands or Bust!

I mean I am more disturbed and put off by the ads I get than by any of the videos I watch. Every chance I get, I stop viewing the ads for the horror, thriller, and suspense movies, but I still get them. There's nothing I can do to stop it I've tried changing the AdSense settings and try fixing things it still doesn't do anything. I still get those videos, those ads. And I want to watch ads to support people, but those ads are very messed up and...scary. Yes I'm a grown woman scared of these movies. Shush. Point is, YouTubers are sometimes seen as not being advertiser-friendly, but honestly some of the  are  they are not good to be shown. I'm ranting for no reason so I'm stopping now, sorry.
Tbh, YouTube is the place I would MOST LIKELY watch an ad and actually research a product/organization. It really irritates me that demonetization actually exists. I mean, I understand why they do it, but it still irritates so much. It's funny because this is the first time I've ever felt unrepresented despite being a minority.  You know how many times I've watched the super bowl? Never. And how many times I plan to watch it in the future? Zero. And how many times I watch YouTube? Every day. And what percentage of that is gaming? A good 60%. And how long do I plan to keep watching? FOREVER.
So... Gamers have been changing the world for the better.
I know it isn‚Äôt as big as preventing people from suicide, but sometimes when I feel like I can‚Äôt do something I think, ‚Äúif matpat calculated all of the possible playable fun levels in Mario maker, only to come up with a number bigger than infinity, then I can do math homework‚Äù
Also
He needs to get ready for when Mario maker 2 comes out
now all we need is a new channel called conspiracy Theorist.
Beautiful.
gay lol
I think the gamers are "bad" for the platform because it's mostly just one or two guys playing it with a few editors and maybe some other people. Other channels like Fine bros, Rhett and Link are big asf companies who employ a bunch of people
I like the purple hair
Get yourself a tile floor man, there's tea spilled everywhere.
11:37 you got Pat in there?! Yes!
Why do you think YouTube is investing tens of millions of dollars into the MSM? Because Mainstream Media is dying and YouTubers are taking over. Many YouTubers are independent and aren't told what to think by a hierarchy if narcissistic elitists and to the MSM thats very threatening.
Super late but, every word of what you say is true.  All these great people on YouTube who have saved lives, they should be treated with so much more respect.  At the very least though, you have the respect of everyone on here.  We stand with you MatPat!
Matpat: don't worry its not going to be a rant, but.... rants
"I'm not gonna rant..." goshdarnit Mat Pat, you fooled me once again
This one of the videos I'm now going to when I'm feeling down. It's good to be reminded of good in the world.
I believe a big motivation for people to say that gaming belongs seperated is that it's not an achieving task in real life. People see the sitting on a couch and gaming and living in fictional worlds, instead of the fun and enjoyment people get from it. Being a Twitch streamer doesn't make me a doctor or someone important in the world out there, but if I can live to be happy and make others happy, and be part of this community that I love so much, then why should I need to achieve anything else? I write that because I go through an existential crisis at the moment. I haven't been to work since November, because of psychological problems. The reason for this is that I stress myself on achieving something for people to think positively about me. People I know would shake their heads if I was really an online creator, instead of a programmer in some company with high chances of a well paid position. I don't want that position, I want to live for myself, my dogs and my happiness, while being "forced" to make this job breaks me mentally. I want people to be proud of me, but the only one who needs to be proud is myself. Yet I can't bring myself to quitting, because society would dislike that. I should not care about that, but I do, because all I ever liked was said to be "uninteresting" or "unimportant" or "stupid" even. TV-shows, games, activities I did for fun, they were never good enough to be called useful. And now I really want to become a creator, because it provides the opportunity to do what I love. Am I good at it? I don't know, yet and I feel bad for trying for no other reason than the ghosts in my head telling me that it is stupid and wont make me someone in the real world. Life isn't always fun....I get that....I don't want an excuse for sitting at home. Because I wouldn't be lazy if I were able to feel good with my decisions. I'd have time for my dogs, I'd have time for myself, my garden  and I would be able to provide fun for people who need it at the moment. But the ghosts keep telling me "your goal is not a real goal, it is childish and you should give up to become something useful". 
I didn't want to make this all about me, but thanks for reading! My point is that only we can identify what we are, we know of the value of youtube gamers, they are their own category, but they don't belong OUTSIDE of this Systzem.
I'm very grateful to be one of your subscribers, MatPat.  Whenever I watch these gaming videos online and these theories and livestreams, not only do I learn something fascinating and meaning every day, they always make me feel better about myself and help me keep my stress and angst from bringing me down.  These videos that I watch every day, they're one of the few things left in this world that comfort me -- they're one of the meaningful things left in this world where I personally feel safe from my anxiety.  Thank you very much for posting these videos; they definitely mean a lot to me.
It's ironic but I'm so HAPPY, you've made me cry.üòÇ I'm so friggin touched because of what you said that your words might as well have straight in the heart.üíìüíìüíì
And this is why people are so invested in the Pewdiepie/T Series thing. Whether you like him or not, Felix is pretty the originator of Youtube face cam Let‚Äôs Plays. Not only do people ban together because of him, we band together to support the communities we stand for that raise money, make their livings, and change lives over the platform. I‚Äôm not a diehard Pewds fan myself (absolutely no offense intended) but I still watch some of his stuff, and am subscribed because a company should not overrun YouTube families more than this place already is. I will stand behind the amazing people I‚Äôve met, whether it‚Äôs the YouTubers or fans, because of the platform. I love you guys, and I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do if people like MatPat and Steph (spilling the tea /just being themselves) went away.
The more and more that I listen to this video with more information I've heard recently, it's certainly seems to be true. From the point MatPat is making and the recent news where people are targeting YouTubers that are getting fame are getting targeted for the Vic Mignonia case..
nani
HA pull out
well u could start a theory of the same chrome casts he just talked about i mean isn't it pretty that they could hear u any where in the house??? guys srsly stay away from those...
now im not supposed to give my opinion, but..
The advertisements in this video were scared off by Triggered Mat Pat. There is only one brave ad in the end of the video.
There's something really intimidating about you when you sit in front of the camera like that and start talking seriously and determined without skipping a beat.
You my homie
What blows my mind is that older generations need charity galas where they are thrown an elite free party, with an auction where they will for SURE get something out of their donations like a prize (or at least a fancy night out) before they even CONSIDER donating money (which they  already have an abundance of). But the youtube fans don't have much to give as young adults/teens but still give out of their hearts usually with nothing in return SOLELY becauseTHEY WANT TO HELP. We're sitting at home in our pjs giving out of our shallow pockets and STILL probably make more money in a few hours on a charity stream than rich people at a charity gala that costs money to do.
The world is going to hell my friends, buckle up and enjoy the ride. Evil is winning and there seems to be nothing we can do.
u ok?
nice man you are just awesome mat pat
Loved it.
Hey Mat Pat. Not sure how often you check your comments. But thanks for the low key TFS shout out. Seeing our logo in the video put a smile on my face. Keep up the efforts pushing the envelope for new media content creators.
I like how Mat Pat doesn't even mention how he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for charity
The leader we need but don't deserve
Matt‚Äôs IQ is infinite.
You can just feel the anger from him
Roses are red 
Voliets are blue
Mat pat is gud 
And most youtubers are too üëèüèº
.-.
I‚Äôm not crying üò¢
theres no ads in this videos
MatPat should make a rant channel
Lobun
7:03
I tip my hat to ya mat pat.
Was it tables the YouTuber because she made a vid on that
"Charity is charity. There is no such thing as bad giving." Oh, really? I can think of one charity that might be bad to give to...
Good video
I cant like this enough
Stop at 6:32 and see how many logos you recognize!
I recognize game theory, DHMIS, Film theory, game grumps, Cyanide and happiness, jaiden animations, TheOdd1sOut, treesicle,  markiplier, and Jacksepticeye!
I honestly don't know why you guys care about recognition in the eyes of the news. You get more views than CNN and FOX combined. They are intimidated by the power each individual Youtube creator has. T.V is dying and the only reason people have cable is so they don't have to wait a day for the next episode of game of thrones or John Oliver.
MatPat is finally wrong at something...






PEWDIEPIE IS STILL #1
Peado tshirt
Preech MatPat
Thing is, in my opinion, people who report the news aren't just against positive stories about YouTubers, they want a few positive stories period. That's why I don't watch news broadcasts or channels with the exception of one here on YouTube. Next time anyone watches the news pay attention and I will guarantee that 80-95% of the stories are negative in one form or another. Oh, and about the NFL, our military pours tons of money into advertising there and forms of "mandatory patriotism" but no one puts a stop to that either.
Its like their trying to suppress us with what gamers can do. IdgI yet but it seems like they don't want this to happen, it's like they have been planning something long ago that should be the same as from the present future. ( I sound derpy but there's a part to it)
you can buy orcas?
Logan Paul
the ending  seems like hes sangry (sad and angry} and p* off
matt patt isn't playing much games though. here's the thing if he plays a game it's usually because of charity or new fnaf or something like that but mainly does theory's on games and films
Well Mat...most gaming channels are targeted to kids or young adults. Used by parents to distract children while mum and dad go about responsibilities. Honestly the charities have been amazing, but I think it weird out advertisers and companies in the way you guys EARN those donations. Like the ice bucket challenge or saying a word over and over again for a million times. For the viewers, it's entertainment, but to "outsiders" like companies and advertisers, it's wtf. It's sorta like a niche, and technically is pop culture.


You say your stuff is educational, and it is Mat, but it's not the kind of knowledge that's going to nail me a white-collar career or help me pass my SATs. And tbh...most people in the real world don't see Youtube as a real 'job'. That mentality stereotypes what they think of a youtuber, much less a youtube gamer. But people would look at you normally if you were to call yourself an entertainer, comedian, or online content writer. These same people see video games as an escape from real-world responsibilities regardless if they have good intentions or not. There's no 'prestige' to being a youtube gamer. A lot of people who want to be a successful youtuber aren't doing it for the intention of one day being able to donate thousands of dollars, but just a way to escape from your current job. Heck, I can't even stream a game my first time on Twitch and just wanting to have someone to talk to without them thinking I one day want to be a big Twitch streamer and earn a lot of revenue. These attitudes set the look for youtube gamers as greedy, flashy, and showy kids.


And to note it is also a generation thing. I'm sure in the next 100 years when kids growing up are nearly required to adapt to tech is that when things put youtube gamers in better light.
MatPat will be the reason YouTube changes, mark my words
*vsauce 2 and 3
youtube has helped me with my depression it helped me when i was feeling terrible like when my cat died and it gives me some form of protection of the bad things in the world. ive found lots of people on youtube who help me go through it and matt you were one of the people who helped me get out of this ball of depression that im in. the world is scary but you make it better you helped me matt so thank you.
Thanks
They can only step on you if you allow them.
This is why I hate group projects!
Well, Matthew seems to become someone more serious, more driven by justice, more determined than ever before. It seems like  He will be a new Prophet, a warrior, a new leader of the youtube community, the Whole of it! In any case, i know which side to pick, if i'd have to. Change doesn't come from comfort, therefor Sir Matthew has risen and picked up his arms, shared his mind to the world and all of it is just the beginning of the beginning.
v-=IMHO=-v
Also, just my 'IMHO' here (if we are discussing them already), but tbh i did Not care at all what kanye or the kardashians (nearly forgot about their existance as well..) have done, who else has? Also how many young people/children watch or even know/care about them compared to the gaming community of yt (again proves your point of yt being the bigger influencer in reality)? The big advertising companies might not really care about them either. The only reason celebrities are still relavent enough is becaouse the are rich and they do a lot of thing with their money that ceeps some people still interested.. maybe?
Again, that's just an IMHO right now, but i'd like to know or hear or even see what other minds might think? Maybe i missed something in the video? or i'm just that uncultured xD idk lol.
In any case, We all are with you Saint Matthew, as well as the rest of the rightful (no, i don't mean just gaming) community!
<3
Well done Mat Pat. Well done.
Jack:I know my place in this universe
Me:can you teach me mine
Headline:
Matpat attacks fellow youtuber Cancer survivor Jake of v-sauce 3.
And this is why we all LOVE you Matpat. Keeping telling the truth bro.
me almost done with the video
mat pat attacks when he gets attacked 
but the media will always find a way through this video or another
Just found your channel and love the message! Subbed
They say demons run when a good man goes to war. Our good man is strapping up!!!
Thanks for the info is appreciated
"Wow" this literally teared mine eyes
When he said bad actors i was confused
Why did matpat get highlights
When Mat sits on that couch he's gonna force our eyes open then feed us strange wholesome facts. Btw thanos hair XD.
Atta boy. EVERYONE SHARE THIS VIDEO
DAAAAAAAANG  this is LEGIT  get em boy!
MatPat for YouTube president!
Love that Captain Eo shirt.
Idk if it was but if it wasn't this should be trending I'm so happy that someone is taking a stand
Bad shirt choice lmao
#atleastigotanad
Woah he got pissed
#shared
THIS. THIS .THIS THIS. I can't believe I wasn't subbed on this account. Fixed.
YouTube is change and people hate change. They'll always fight it. Just be proud of all the good you do. :)
Some what? Ive learned more physics here than my actual physics class
Pretty sure you just called for a war throughout YouTube
Talking about charity with companies who care about profits.

Marketing is about segregation and targeting (also the marketing mix). 
The way I see it companies don‚Äôt consider people who watch gaming videos as potential buyers (they think it‚Äôs only kids and loners who have from low to no income). Thus concluding that advertising to an audience that won‚Äôt buy the product as a bad decision. Also there are other factors like company image and bad publicity. My point is that they don‚Äôt clearly understand the market and consider it risky. 

Also have you see Facebook‚Äôs annual report, those guys are doing great, since advertising seems to be moving across platforms.
When are you planning to run for office? AAA
The Johnny Depp comment did not age well damn
GAMERS ARE OPPRESSED
A regular "good YouTube news" show would be awesome =)
mat make a point
Dear MatPat. I love you and I love this channel. But I‚Äôm afraid that leaking out ,this kind of information in such a broad open and honest fashion may lead to an opposing smear campaign that will do their best to bury you. You mentioned that one day the gaming channels will have to get up and do something else. Personally I believe you would make a fantastic lawyer/ political activist. My prayers are with you MatPat .stay strong.
Journalists are basically digging themselves in a hole because the younger generation loves YouTube and once this generation gets older they will not want to support or view the news outlet or website that the articles slandering YouTubers were on
Get 'em Matt!
Is that an MJ shirt??
Man i cried..........
This video has to go viral please share it
you should make youtube theory
It's almost like modern journalism has taken a massive dive in quality and integrity to chase clicks.
Huh, weird, that.
gamers truly are the most oppressed gender
big corporations will eventually catch on to the fact that the average person trusts youtubers now days far more than the mainstream media. i'm far more willing to buy something i see one of my favorite content creators advertising than something i see on CNN or Fox News. just like news papers gave way to blogs and things like facebook or twitter...the broadcast media will give way to youtube and twitch. we just have to make it past this awkward transition phase.
Oh wow, this was really powerful. Thank you for making this‚Äîit‚Äôs refreshing to be reminded of why I love this community
It really makes me mad to know that even with a video of this quality, this truth, they won't change.
Keep up the rants. Maybe a new series.
Johnny depp was the one being abused btw
4,7k dislikes. I think they are journalists XD
Ive decided
We need to make MatPat the owner/manager/ceo of youtube
Mat your a good person you travel the truth all the time and should be in the hall of fame and this channel should be passed on your family I solute
MatPat i swear, if in one or some years there is gonna be a documentary uncovering that you're in reality a scumbag, imma unsubscribe from humanity. Keep up the amazing work.
MATPAT WENT OFF
That's it. Matpat has snapped.
1.7k dislikes are from the media hating on YouTubers
R I S E U P
Idea: All the famous YouTubers that are available can get together in ONE PLACE. Gaming would be preferred, but anyone would be awesome. There‚Äôd be a huge charity event. All the big-name people would attract their fans to donate, and that‚Äôll be Day 1. The amount of money raised- which will be HUGE- will get uploaded. People would start sharing it, and Day 2, there‚Äôd be more people, people who don‚Äôt know these YouTubers but want to donate their money to whatever good cause(s) y‚Äôall decide to donate to, and they see your essentric personalities, the fun, the laughs, but also the benefits, the education, and, most important, the influence. Maybe every hour or other hour or so, there‚Äôd be a showcase where a YouTuber would confront the audience and explain some major things either that they‚Äôve done, have witnessed another YouTuber do, or have been told about by their fans. They‚Äôd read off certain examples for that last one, and that will really get the ball rolling. Day 2 may not make as much money, but it would highly benefit the public name of YouTubers, YouTube as a whole, and the communities we live in. Day 3 could be like a repeat Day 2, a ‚Äúgaming‚Äù day, a ‚Äúfun-and-games‚Äù day, or a random/party day where everyone would go through certain challenges/events/games and do fun stuff and just entertain for the sake of entertaining.

After all three days, the press wouldn‚Äôt be able to ignore us gamers anymore. It just wouldn‚Äôt be possible. If we have to put a sticky note on the money when we donate that says ‚ÄúPAY US SOME ATTENTION DANG IT, WE‚ÄôRE DYING HERE! WE NEED PRESS. SOS‚Äù, then we will. 

Just a thought. I‚Äôd love to see that happen sometime.

Like so Mat can see!
This video makes me so much more heated about ‚Äútraditional‚Äù media and huge money hungry corporations.
Yo you want that microphone back? You threw it away so hard, it warped through my monitor.
Matt. You don‚Äôt need the press. The reason we watch YouTube is because we found a community that cares about us, that looks like us, that is curated by us. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt look at news sites or watched TV in so long. YouTubers are loved because they haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúpressed‚Äù and made ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù The people sitting in the high chairs don‚Äôt understand that, and are trying to modify things in a way that they think will bring the flow of money. It‚Äôs always been about the people we get to choose, support, and watch, not what‚Äôs fed to us on a constantly playing TV.

I hope that this all works out and they money you deserve comes back to you.
You also get a tax break for donations. So yea if your rich you should definatley be donating. Because it benefits you and other  less fortunate. Or those companies are just pilfering your money. They say how much money is going to charity or simply just get skimmed off for the top CEO.
Whooop. Someone get a mop. That‚Äôs a lot of spilled tea.
This dude used theorizing to roast every advertiser on earth...
Honestly it‚Äôs disgusting how the media looks at gaming YouTubers just because they play games for a living. The amount of time and effort it takes to do that is a struggle of its own and with the advertisers pulling away they may not get paid for their work. They all do so much good for the community and I want to thank Matpat for bringing up this issue.
Big RESPECT to MatPat!!!
More power to us Gamers!
Your our Hero!
Mat: *RANTS PASSIONATELY, FLUIDLY, AND TRUTHFULLY‚Äù
YouTube: ...
YouTube: ...
YouTube: looks for yellow button
I raised $85 for ALS research last year with a 24 hour stream, and was happy doing that. It was enough to pay for something.
this is a deep video
So I doubt I'm the first to say this and I also acknowledge there's no guarantee you'll even notice this post.  But MatPat?  You need to run for public office.
iv only seen film theory so when i see matpats mouth  moving itnmakes me feel weard.
Thank you for this video. Just... Thank you.
I will not argue, I cannot argue, I will just state we are the country of hypocrisy, so sad
Well, that Depp comment was poorly timed.
Love your shirt
I would love to write my paper about this, do any one knows the cites he used?
MiniLadd Shoutout! Woop woop!
Screw being scared of the Fan from FNAF. Be very afraid of the Couch from MatPat‚Äôs live-streamsüòÇ
THANK. YOU. MAT. PAT.
I know having this video up doesn‚Äôt change things as much as we‚Äôd like it to, but by voicing this injustice you‚Äôre doing more than I ever could. Thank you for caring enough to put this together, passionate enough to to carry it out, genuine in your opinions enough to tie this video to your name and being smart enough to do it so well. I recognise this injustice, I understand (and strongly agree with) your convictions, but what can I do about it?    to make any indentation against this at all... so thank you for doing what I can‚Äôt. For doing  I‚Äôm standing with you
If mat pat had a trigger button, advertiser  smacked it hard
MatPat people only care about money, they're just throwing us under the bus for money!
MatPat you must be the Voice of YouTube, I hate to see it fall because of this, and MatPat will be Our Battle Cry!
No leave it Like that
I feel like old media is just attacking online creators because they feel threatened by it. They don't care about "brand safety".
to the word
I did a speech in front of my science class about how dory is a fake just by remembering the video. At the end I asked the class who watches matpat and around 10 people raised their hands.
Edit: IT‚ÄôS ALWAYS LISTENING.
there should be a community where it's only purpose is to share videos like this








(there probably is and i just didn't find it yet)
ilhan omar: it's all about the benjamins
Check out the boyz of Newlegacyinc, they raise a whole hell of a lot of money for the Canadian Cancer society by doing a 24 hour wrestling game stream every couple of years called the Royaliest of Rumbles. They legit doubled their goal in 2017.
You tell them and so you know this is why I continue to watch and support your content üòÅ
YouTube is mankind's best creation.
Someone is pouring millions into google to stop gaming becoming popular and additionally someone is also paying mass media to look the other way...

However, the online community and world community is fed up wit the continued double standards and the mass media is as extinct as a T-Rex in a tar pit!

It‚Äôs only a matter of time, how many people still go to the shops to buy a newspaper?
Who rushes home to catch the news?
Conventional entertainment is changing and mass media needs to embrace that change or they will fall by the wayside.
The mediums change with the times and there will always be those that refuse to accept it.
4.7K advertisers disliked this
6:31 heyyy tear of grace is on that, that's something special......i'll show myself out
Matt patt should be on the flash
I got a theory a gay theory
3:35 I pretty much died of laughter
TIL PewDiePie gave to charity and therefor isn't a problem.
It's all about control.
"A gamer will never be on that top tier list"

Gamers are truly the  most oppressed minority
Gamers Rise Up.
4:49 is one of the many reasons that gamers are the most oppressed minority
I feel sad for MatPat, he's been very agitated/angry because of all that's happened to him. I've always thought of him as the happiest guy around, but these videos show that he's been going through a lot lately.
its OK for you to laugh at a bad joke because you're a dad.
this is beautiful... depression is my worst enemy and at 11 years old and you have given me more hope...
thank you... ; v ;
I am speechless... 
This is all accurate and I didnt notice that.
Welp, I became teary eyed listening to how amazing youtubers can be and are. Thanks Matt patty. Probably should donate some tissues to me :)
looks at video

EVERYONE SEND THIS TO EVERYONE
11:25 Sam Colby Elton Cory üòÇüòá
Great video, shame the only people who'll see this are the people who already agree with you because we're the ones on YouTube and not the mainstream.
NO DO NOT SAY THAT! I DO NOT WANT YOU QUITTING ONE DAYY!
People probably know that, but:
1- companies have 0 reasons, to be honest as money is the goal and lies work like a charm.
2- Youtubers are the enemy of traditional celebrities and journalists as in a few years they have exploded into the scene and are threatening their positions
3- GAMERS ARE THE MOST OPPRESSED GROUP! Don't @ me
When mat pat gets on the couch, you KNOW some stuff is going down.
I have became a volunteer in my school bcz of youtube and charity streams.
When MatPat has COUCH THEORY
Bruh im so dumb, im confused on whats happening
THIS IS THE VIDEO THE WORLD NEEDED
14:20 I cried just a bit damn
Hi. Got a new phone/email and subscribed again.
I am liking jaded Matt Pat
Who heck disliked this video
I thought this would be more about like... Secrets not so much... Of .... Talking about what youtubers have done
Hell na i‚Äôm going to go sit in my couch wearing my favourite Michael Jackson shirt Talking about how youtube is screwing people
That jacket is really cool. I've got one about like it except for the hood. Anyone know where I can get that one?
Youtube doesn't stand up for its creators, and the advertisers know this. Advertisers walk all over youtube because youtube lets them.
I use at least 5 tiers of adblocking starting before the router connection. I try very hard to not be served an ad. I would rather just give the people I support money directly. 

This is why i love placed like floatplane.com its growing steadily
I've been watching you over the years mat, but this one got me subscribed to you. Great work, i hope those companies you refer to, hear about this and do something about it.
4:59 
just more evidence that gamers are the most oppressed minority
Love your work man u have helped me to be more open to my nerdy self and not be ashamed of it thank you for that
The best click bait ever
While this video is great I just want to correct the comparison you made with Johnny Depp as it was allegedly found to be that his wife was the one who was abusing him and has evidence to prove it. While the case is still ongoing I believe, it's not necessarily in best form to use him as an example considering there is a good chance he is innocent and was actually the victim instead.


Don't wanna ruin the mood but just felt I'd put that out there. Especially considering this whole video centers around bad press of media stars and defamation of YouTubers. It just felt in bad form to include him.
4.7k Australians liked this.
I‚Äôm not crying üò¢ 
You‚Äôre..... you‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs crying üò¢
Actually tho that was serious
We need YouTube to explain
it seems gamers really ARE oppressed...
huh so people are actually nice
Oi take off that t-shirt
This is a gaming channel????
I teared up when you were listing all the smaller youtubers who raised money. It‚Äôs so beautiful and sad at the same time
> "this won't be a rant don't worry guys"

> the video





I'm just kidding this was really good keep it up üëç
Rise up brothers and sisters...the rebellion is upon us
Not gonna lie, I actually enjoy watching matpats rants
Did he say he wasn‚Äôt going to rant
But what if you don't have a favorite channel
puts away pitchforks
11:00 DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD BE HOW DATTO WOULD BE FEATURED ON GAME THEORY üòÇüò¨
Keep it up Mat! OG media is just fadeing away and they are doing everything to cling on to that cliff edge. They are attacking anything that threatents that hold.
Nobody:
MatPat: Wait thats illegal
Lol ur just finding this out I've been talking about double standards for years and they havnt even directly affected me
They pulling out because they don't want game youtubers pregnant, so to speek
How hard would it be to get YouTubers on strike?
how nice for this video to have a st.jude advertisement following it. good work, mat, i hope more of the press become aware of this.
Cats are liquid?
Honestly, as the owner of a charity that helps foster, at risk, and homeless youth--please feel free to make donations into a competition. That said, it would be super cool if a portion of those donations could be put into an ever growing managed account, for renewable donations. It would equally be cool to have a voting system for portioning out the interest generated each year to a list of charities we'd each Love to see donated to.
Mat pat angry couch = lots of views
i am a gaming youtuber and this makes me mad what are we doing wrong
"SHOOT, I did end up ranting! I'm sorry!..........Youtubers are great." LOL rant or not you are doing amazing work here in educating and starting good commentary here on the internet.
But hey that's  just an opinion


My opinion
The charity stream you did last year saved my life. I was suicidal and you spoke of how you wanted us to keep trying cuz we were loved by you and Steph and I stopped. Thank you matpat. And to all the gamers and youtubers in general that helped me: thank you so much.
Matpat, I've been a fan of this channel, of both your channels, for about a year or two by now, and let me tell you... thanks. This comment will surely get lost in a literal storm of more on-point, accurate, well-written comments of the same kind, but I feel like I have to say something. I don't comment often, I'm not a creator, I can't follow GTLive as much as I'd like to because of school and other stuff, and I've never donated, so I couldn't, on paper, be less interested by the themes you touched in this video. 
On paper, as you said. 
I don't know, it's just... I'm just a teenage boy who loves science, and thank goodness I approached this channel. 
You probably get tons of these every day by now, but I just want to say thank you for building such an amazing community  around Game Theory, Film Theory, and around the figure of yourself. You always manage to teach me something new, like today, and I guess I'm just overreacting to something, but I felt like this was the best place to say it. 
Thank you.
Dude you are the epitome of fake.
Youtubers are and will always be great.





But YouTube itself won't.
I do think that YouTubers do a lot of good, but I also think they need to do better to stop getting into controversy. A lot of children watch their videos and when they do things like say slurs it sends a message to children that things like that are okay. I hope that in the future the most popular of YouTubers can become better at being positive roll models for young children.
this is one of the only channels that make humanity  seem good again, didn't really think any one could do that for me again. Thank you
Johnny Depp's accusations have bin  Proven to be fake set up by his wife so she can get money out of it
Lol the Johnny depp thing is going to hurt you but I agree as a whole.
You teach us more about economics in one video than my economics teacher did in three months.
IT'S JK ROLLING!!!
6:05 YES
SOMEONE NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT CHADTRONIC. His channel is going through some bizarre things, unlike anything else I've seen, that could shed some real light on what YouTube is up to. It's too fascinating to ignore, like, they are really experimenting with this poor guy.
Man, this is something that speaks to everyone, no matter their age, skin color, or anything else that people mindlessly discriminate against. Please, for the good sake of YouTube's future, make sure this video reaches someone else.
I cried... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I LIKE THE PURPLE
and I am pretty sure that this vid is gonna get demonitezed
The ADD OF üíÄ
End gamer discrimination
So. About Johnny Depp....
Where did you get that shirt
I get why you would say that people should not hypocrites but being a African  American  I think that This is america is a good showing of what Black People are facing in America right know and that is why they keep it up, plus they could end up offending many people if they took  it down.
When MatPat does clickbait but it‚Äôs for a serious video for the good of YouTube and has no ads


Thanks, Satan.
You are the only youtuber who wants the world to know the truth... A salute for you
What's dumb is how advertisers don't realize that Online celebrities have the same if not more influence on their fans than a normal celebrity who doesn't talk to their fans on a personal level. I say we boycott ever single advertiser that starts pulling out (hehe) of YouTube and if we start a big enough movement then they would be desperate to come back to the platform. It isn't fair for you all to get treated like this.
It's Old media vs New media, and advertisers want to pay less for adverts on YouTube. They're not interested in the YouTube "scandals", they just want to save some money. That's why they're willing to make stuff up about YouTubers and usher in a new adpocalypse just to get a better deal on the platform. That's what's actually going on. This is also why I decided to pay for YouTube Premium. I'd rather give money directly to YouTube and YouTubers, to keep this whole thing going, than have the whole platform rely on the money of these terrible advertisers.
Is mat bisexual?
#ThatMicDropAtTheEndTho

You have quite the charisma for passion of injustice as well. While you were stating and laying down those facts I was mentally shouting along with ya. XD As always, an amazing video MatPat.
The Johnny Depp situation has been resolved. Its been proven that Amber Heard lied about being abused by him
Ha! I am glad for the clarification at the end. Definitely a rant video :)
we need the world to spawn more matts- skskks
NOW THATS JUST A OPINION. A GOOD STRUCTURED OPINION. Thanks for watching.
loved the vid, haven't understood anything yet
He reminds me of Schmidt from New Girl
Matpat for president tbh
Ness is actually sans guys I‚Äôm shaking
Cutest YouTuber there ever was
Yogscast is the best
YouTube gamers are consider lesser!?! Wtf I can honestly say I would not be here if it wasn't for the gaming side of YouTube. I even wanted to a gamer on YouTube for years. Still do I'm just don't have the time. The system f'd
THIS IS SO SAD (in a good way) ALEXA,  PLAY ONE OF MATPAT‚ÄôS FNAF THEORIES
"Nobody wants positive stories about YouTubers." Literally had an argument with my mom over her thinking that pewdiepie is a Nazi or something. And I kept telling her, "Big news outlets like Fox and CNN only talk about YouTubers when they have a major screw up. Thank you for always speaking the truth, you will always be an inspiration to all many views and fellow gaming creators like myself. Thank you, I hope that one-day games will get the same respect as any other type or creator in the world. If we get the most views subs and simply have the most influence on youtube, then youtube by god you better give me, mat, and all the other youtube gamers the respect we danm well deserve.  Mid-tier influencer?!? They might have well-given mat a god damn participation trophy. Youtube to quote Eminem, "step off bitch."
The thing is, YouTube is for the younger generation and YouTubers have less money than the traditional.
I mean, they could be doing to to help a small group as well, who have ptsd's stay away from youtube :/ people with fears can stay away from games to not remind them of how its like for them again, no not from wars, just ptsd from anything, my cousin talked about this with me and she explained how she has a very dark humor, I mean VERY dark humor, she doesn't have a lot of friends because of it because they get offended a lot. So maybe people like you talk about matpat who say stay away from youtube, could just be helping us stay protected instead of having people with ptsd's go crazy, and hurt people like me.. just me though I guess. I have to stay away from youtubers like you and game grumps because of this and I don't know anything anymore :/ just throwing out ideas. 
But yes you guys do "deserve" a better 'thrown', name than you guys have now for this reason üòÜ I say "deserve" because you guys already have it I guess.
But hey, that's just.... it's not a theory. It's an opinion. My opinion.
Thanks for watching.
So many numbers üôÅ
WHAT IS YOU'RE STORY
So, what happens if youtube, advertisers, and channels do something smart, you say? The fabric of the universe would tear, plunging us all into an infinite abyss of death.
I cried a little bit because youtube communities have been there for me when I was at my lowest. I've watched games that because money is tight for me, that I am never going to pick up a controller and play myself and I can rewatch them if I so choose. I get emotional because I remember the shift that happened and how freaked out I was because I didn't know who was going to stay. I hope for a better direction, but idk if that will ever happen.
I work in the advertising industry, you would be surprised by how many old school, madmen type dudes are still around. I mean, of course they were successful at some point but they refuse to adapt to the new world regardless of media trends and studies or where people get their entertainment from. I mean they keep spending $5 million+ on the Super Bowl even though only 14% people who watch the commercials retain it, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd learn their lesson at some point. 
Keep up the good work Matpat, some day we‚Äôll be the ones in charge and the world will realize how wronged they‚Äôve been about us.
17:40 matt you got that wrong buddy. Johnny is innocent, he was always innocent.
People that dislike this make me sick like gamers help lives and matpat is giving us a awesome üëè speech and people are disliking it which is not ok üëç when us gamers are doing our best but we are called NOTHING.
I do feel like the Johnny Depp thing should be expanded upon.
Witnesses and evidence are coming in droves that it was his ex-wife that was the actual abuser.
I loved the opinion and how you lead the speech, but I disagree with adding the Johnny Depp case because it isn't solved yet, and he is suing his ex-wife for home abuse and defamation.
OMG ITS PRONOUNCED SUPER CELL? OH FRICK IVE BEEN SAYING IT LIKE SOOP ERIC ELL OH FRICK OH GOD OH FRICK
Amber Heard abused Johnny Depp.
correct me if i'm wrong, but Michael Jackson shirt? too soon?
It‚Äôs all conflict of interest. The regular media attacks YouTube and others because those platforms are taking away ad money that used to go to them.
Ah yes, the most oppressed group of them all, GAMERS!
You're a Top Tier Channel to me MatPat!
Matpat is an legend in legend
Welp, this is america
I feel like these series of videos are gonna go in history as something big
ALmost cryed this is pretty deep
Matpat plz make this into a new channel: controversy theory
Great video , but you probably picked the wrong week to wear a Michael Jackson t-shirt
The leader of YouTube
In a nutshell:the advertisers do not know who they need
The mainstream media lost their platform with television, and so they hopped onto Youtube like the parasites they are and have been trying to dominate it ever since. Why do you think you see more company channels like The Late Night Show dominate the trending page more than actual youtube creators? They've been trying to get rid of us, cause we are their biggest competition.
What's a good alternative for YouTube? And why isn't that competing neck and neck against YouTube?
That's just an opinion.. love the switch on the frase. and the micdrop! <3
I honestly love it when MatPat rants cause his rants are so powerful and beautiful
I‚Äôm really inspired by your passion. Love it!!!
For sure brah...welcome to Capitalism....
matpat's salt level is through the roof and I love it
"became a bit too aggressive" H M M M M
Let's bring this down to the core of the issue: YouTube and online content creation represents a disruption of the established system: To be famous, you have to be in traditional media (sports, TV, movies, fashion, and music), and you have to live and breathe in the elitist ideals of those mediums: We're better than you, we have more money than you, we have access to nicer things than you. Now you have people who have access to basic recording equipment and a platform to broadcast (remember the original YouTube slogan? "Broadcast Yourself"), and anyone with the charisma and ability to cut even a half decent video can make money, and even become a millionaire. They're afraid of the cracks in their walls. They're afraid of these "new media" types, the SoundCloud artist, the YouTuber, the Twitch streamer, even the Instagram influencer and the Facebook page owner.

They have people who are entering their community, but they don't have to pass through the gilded gates, show their pass to the security guard, and don't show up in an exotic car. There are Camry's and F-150s in the driveways, and this upsets them. There are women that didn't sleep with executives, LGBTQ, and people who thought they were outcasts moving in. This is the old media's deepest fear: The common man has entered the arena, and has won over the crowd.
I like it when matpat gets serious, its very intriguing to me to listen what he's going to say.
Love to you to come to Argentina and start a MCN as they should be... you got my back
Get this man a shield!
When u hit the 5 min mark IS THIS JUST ABOUT SHIPPING LABELS!!
That awkward moment when you talk about child predators while wearing a micheal jackson tshirt...üòë
I can legitimately not think of a valid reason to dislike or criticize this video. Videos like this need to be seen by everyone.
Wahahahah makes this video with a straight face whilst having a pedo's face printed on his chest.
YES!
MatPat saved me. If it wasn't for him and a few other ytube gamers. I'd be dead. I thank and am so happy that they made channels make videos. They all gave me a reason. Thanks MatPat
The last adpocalipse is not even about video creators, but freaking comments.
What I have learned from MatPat:

Ads are dying 
YouTube is messed up
Google is odd
And gamer are the real heroes
#SpreadPositiveInfluenceOfYoutube
I have anxiety and epilepsy, my seizures being triggered by the anxiety. Sometimes when I feel like I might just drop to the ground, I think about your instructive theories and smile. I‚Äôm less likely to faint when being happy...so thank you üôèüèº üòá
Now you should expect demonetization because of Michael Jackson (and its recent documentary) on your shirt üòÇ
Matpat please address how Johnny Depp was not the abuser and was the victim in his marriage. Please do that to be fair and balanced. I really love your work as a content creator. Supported your videos, talked about them, I bought your merchandise cause I love game theory and film theory. However for honesty's sake and to be fair and balanced please address it.
You know I wasn't planning on crying today. But here we are. I can count myself proud to be part of the YouTube gaming community. Gaming community in general.
if you ever do a followup video and you want a ludicrous example of community engagement and charity, take a look at the Critical Role cast and their history with their fans. Absolutely. Insane.  I know they aren't primarily YouTubers, but it is a similar vein of content creation
YouTube is an army the will fight for its freedoms
Just to add another YouTuber making a difference Kendall Rae ( who makes many true crime videos) has a ‚Äúmerch‚Äù line that 100% goes to Thorn which helps create systems against human trafficking üôè
Where's the üëëKing of the Web vid?
6:53 makes me laugh every time
If you believe Depp's wife allegations over Depp you are a misandrist.
Matpat is so punk rock
The emotion was raw
good vid and all, but can we talk about how sick that shirt is? üî•
Aw... MatPat. You're just so great.
I've been Matthew Patrick. Thank You for coming to my TED Talk.
The short way of saying it is that times are changing. Actors/musicians/news outlets don't want YouTubers to be on the same level as them. They want to be the top dog. The thought is that to set a YouTuber equal to an Actor is to raise the YouTuber's standing but lower the actor's. They're the old way of doing things and they're scared of being replaced by YouTube. Actors fuel a good portion of the media and to knock them down is to hurt the media. So, the media runs a campaign to lower the standing of YouTubers. Why target the gaming community though? Well, because it's both the biggest and easiest to target. It's not hard to convince most people from older generations that watching people play video games, when they already view video games negatively, as a waste of time. After all... Why waste time watching a video on something you could do yourself? It's in their best interest for YouTubers to fail. It makes it so that they don't have to adapt. They don't have to worry about some random person with a mic and enough time to do research to be able to threaten them. As such they only share negativity about YouTube which scares away the advertisers. By scaring away the advertisers you kill revenue for your opposition. Thus ensuring the old way of doing things stays in place.

TL;DR: Media/actors/musicians are scared of YouTubers upsetting the current "fame hierarchy"
Youtubers are the American Red Cross of the internet.

MatPat is coming for traditional media's neck
Wow. Gamers are actually the most oppressed group. RISE UP!
This got me over all the bad stuff collected over the past week. #PrayForNZ
I'm not gonna lie, watching everyone's videos is always the most exciting part of my day.
Questipn why did you ignore algeria dude (the map)
Well im watching a chanel, where my russian friend play TF2. And his videos is demonetized everytime. He didnt swearing and other "not family friendly content" things. I just dont understand this.
P.s. im russian too)
Johnny Depp is innocent, and firearm channels (talking about the history of them and demonstrating how to use them responsibly) also got demobilized unfairly.
happy jingle jam was included. i am dave! yognaught and i have the balls
It's nuts how important topics only come up when Mid-Tier Matpat's ego is bruised.
I got goosebumps...I'm also drowning in spilled tea.

Basicly people are afraid of new things. Or things that are different than what they are used too. YouTube is new just like gaming. In a few decades everything will be streamed and online. Late night shows won't excist anymore on television. But they will online. 

The real reason why people are stopping advertisements on YouTube and not on the Oscars or on the NFL is because if my theory is true, alot of companies will go bankrupt thanks to the digital age.
I'm glad you made this.  I haven't seen anyone else giving this much insight.
Man this is a great channel
Do the part 2 for the last timeline video on fnaf
Is the couch comfy just wondering.
Mat Pat talking about child predators while wearing a Michael Jackson T-shirt, talk about controversial
As jackaboy would say, Let‚Äôs get this charity bread gamers!
So this is my reward for waiting.
It is just old media afraid of new media, and rightfully. I talked with my friends (we are all in our mid to end 20s) and literally no one of us is watching TV anymore. Why should you watch TV when you have Youtube, Twitch or Netflix. There is better, more fitting for you entertainment and you can decide when to watch it. While TV tries to produce something which "everyone" can enjoy, but we are all different. And then make it 50% commercial to get money out of it, and you have to change your plans to be at the right time in fron of the TV. Believe Television is dying. And "old media" knows that too, and right now they still have more power then new media so they use this power to try to keep new media small but the change is already happening.
MatPat is speaking some true facts here.
Luv his vids
Wow. Matpat haven't done this in a while. Mostly theorizing but he's still good in both
I am tired of the old legacy media's notion that the only news is bad news.  Than you for highlighting actual good news in our community.
I got an ad during the vid! (The irony)
6:08-any public school student when the teacher lets you have your phone out.

In Germany there's also an event every year called Friendly Fire (this year will be the fifth time) where YouTubers like Gronkh, PietSmiet etc. come together to play and entertain and with these four events they've gathered almost 2 million Euros by now! :D
The last event though made the most money with around 900.000 Euros
Too bad no bigger newspaper talked about this amazing event. :/
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes
Gamers are the most oppressed members of society.

EDIT: Alright, ah reckon I didn‚Äôt mean to start a war ‚Äòtween furries and gamers
This is a small one compared to the others, but a YouTuber I like called YuB has raised $1328 for charity (off-camera).
MatPat: *Mic Drop*. Everyone on YouTube: OOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!
CAN I GET AN AMAN
Now the media is going to think you're a nazi because you mentioned Pewds and doing good things in the same sentence.
This full honesty MatPat it's giving me chills, this videos are great, I salute you, man.

Was I the only person that thought of Thomas Sanders when Mat said "Storytime" ?
No?
Ok, I'll go
I don't think "no one wants to hear good stories about youtube" is necessarily restricted to youtube. There was a story about this blind guy in Turkey. He went onto this "Who wants to be a Billionare" kind of program and got every answer correct. On that show, he explained he does a lot of reading and remember precisely the things he read. Media ran a smear campaign against the guy, calling him a cheat and a liar. Sometime after, some journalists got together and went to the guys house to ask him questions. He got every one of them right. Not one of the journalists withdrew what they initially said.
My point here is that once you gain negative attention, that is all people will talk about. Because negative things have a tendency of garnering more attention than positive ones. This could be partly because negative things make better conversations arguably. But I won't get ahead of myself.
Matpad leaning a little to the camera, Holding His hand a little closer and talking agressivly about this is American is literaly the scaryest Thing i will come across

Demonetized pa tito youtube!
I so badly want to be a Youtuber because I thought of spreading some smile around the places. People say I'm the nicest person they ever met and I want to inspire people to do good in the world as well, along with it is give people the sense of comfort that you're not alone but in a family of gaming lovers or whatever. I want to build a place for people to feel comfortable in and can relate to it. I have been through so much stuff in my life that I almost end my life a couple of times until I start using Twitter and they helped me through so much that I want to say thank you to each and every single person that helped me, I want to cry and hug them. I badly want to do that. I want to be an inspiring of a person to people that we're all family and friends here! nothing can bring us down because we only get stronger every time we got knocked down to the floor since our friends will help us back up and keep trying to push forward together!
Throwin shade
To be fair I'm pretty sure that it turned out that Deep wasn't an abuser so maybe you wanna clear that so that people don't get it wrong...
2:41 let me rephrase it

no media wants positive news about ANYTHING

edit: holy cow, thank you for 150 likes
For years I've been inspired by the likes of Pewdiepie, Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, Yogscast, and even Game Theory itself during the years that I needed these channels most. They helped me through a lot of depressing times, through loss of family and hardships, and in my last year of highschool I decided that I wanted to do what they did. I wanted to build a community in order to help with mental health, to be charitable and give back for what was given to me. To help as many people as possible. As I moved into college, I took a media class to learn how to edit and to study the media to help me in the future. 


I was full of hope, prosperity, and support by my mother.


Then things changed. 


YouTube began to become more unfair towards content creators that were providing charity for many different places. Things started to shift, and the people I looked up to were now being looked down upon by other content creators and the media. I slowly learnt in my course that 'YouTube isn't a real job' when I spoke about it passionately for my portfolio. People laughed at me for wanting to do the passion that I had inside. The media was putting down so many people by taking away their revenue and being unfair with punishment distributions, via advertisements, that it drained me.


Very recently I had to write an essay on something media based, and I chose to write about how unfair the media and Youtube were being towards content creators on the platform, having been inspired by some of the things you'd talked about recently, and I earned a distinction, which here in England is the top mark for a project / essay. 


I still haven't got there yet. I haven't made my channel yet, or published my first video, but the day will come, and like you said, Markiplier may not be around in 10 or 20 years, but we will, the next generation of people wanting to give back, the next generation of inspiring people who follow in the footsteps of those who guided them. 


All I wish for, and hope for, is that by then, Youtube is recognised as a much better platform than it is now, and we aren't all smushed into one single category of bad people because of one persons mistake. That we can be individualised for our content, and how we change the world penny by penny, or video by video. Producing good stuff that will shape the next generation as we see fit.


Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you so much for making this video.

- Akira.
20:24 GO OFFF, BRO! I can feel your anger. Thank you for doing this!
Go figure literally the day I watch this video my local news covers, the south by southwest gaming expo. they talk about competitive gaming and how in 8 states schools recognize competitive gaming as a varsity sport. 
even having an interview with YouTuber drlupo and his state farm endorsement. I was floored to hear both of these on the same day. granted i am not watching this video on the day it's published day.

 if you want to see it i put my local news shaired link below. consumer report starting at time stamp  -




also found on my local news i found some stories like this :

What is eSports? - KIFI


interesting reads I don't know if they really relates but they are interesting none the less. note that they mention twitch but not YouTube.  intentional or not?
The purple hair thing, well, it's not that bad...
i definitely didnt cry at all. nope. not me.
I totally agree though!! 100%
Most honest and real thing anyone has said publicly in a while.<3
My YouTube force closed when I opened this video
WHY DOES THIS HAVE 4.7K DISLIKES!?!?!? BURN THOSE WITCHES AT THE STAKE!!!


EDIT: Irony. You know, since I'm Satan.
Awesome. I totally agree. There actually wasn't any ad on this video. Just proves a point.
MATPAT IS A HERO
I  LIKE  THIS  NEW  MAT  PAT !!!
enough  theories ...
TIME  TO  EXPOSE  THE  TRUTH !!!
I was once told that media(mostly in the older platforms of TV) hate the internet and those who are successful on the internet. And it's that jealousy and fear that leads them to do these horrible things as they desperately try to stay on top. That might be the cause for the double standard here. I'm not 100% sure of it. But it does remind me of it.
Wearing a red jacket with Michael Jackson beneath! You were straight up channeling the King of Pop.

It is nice for you to say nice things about YouTubers. Thank you for exposing the hypocrisy of the advertisers.
Omg it's like racism but with YouTubers.
Great video. I hope it gets all the attention it deserves.
Dude, The media points influencers as bad content because they are loosing ad' revenue. That's why they are not interested in covering positive stories about youtubers, they only care about spreading the bad word and keeping the ad campains away from online media. Also, trans kids is a sickening thing
THAT'S JUST A THEORY... oh wait he's not doing a theory today nvm
Further proof gamers are the most oppressed group.
Nice hairüòÅ
Negative news makes the money
I. Remember watching Matt Patt in 2010 and  now   he should be one. Of the top youtubers.   Instead of being compared to crap
TOO AGRESSIVE?

Y¬¥know what i¬¥ve realized? MATPAT IS FREAKING AWESOME!!
Johnny Depp didn't abuse his wife. She abused him.
‚Ä¶ this is just... I don't even know
FriendlyFire in Germany
Media is against gaming in general, for years, because is a DIRECT competitor to TV, when you are playing, you are not watching.

I was waiting for you to talk about PewDiePie
"People aren't interested in positive news about Youtubers." Tell that to f'ing Critical Role. They're blowing up rn.
I swear if youtube demonitizes this piece of art, I would cry.

Johnny Depp never abused his wife...

oof that Johnny Depp point could NOT have been made at a worse time
"this will not be a rant" they said
"There will be no couch sitting today" they said,

I'll show them!

<this video has been demonitised>
I pop in to watch your theories every once in a while.. But this video is what made me subscribe. The second half had me on the edge of years constantly. Thank you for this, MatPat.
this made me so emotional honestly when you were talking about the people who aren't represented in the media and turn to youtube for that representation etc. super good video, great points and i thoroughly enjoyed it
One of the greatest vids Ive seen in a long time. Thank you.
Well that's just journalists trying to jack up their readership...So that they can get more ad revenue...
Youtube has been a great community, it being a place where producers made creative ideas and of course mat pat has always inspired me with his videos.
Rewrite the script MatPat; Johnny Depps ex-wife was abusing him then playing the victim. The media grabbed her pleas of abuse and painted him a monster, but he has evidence proving that he was the one actually being abused.
#MatPatForPresident
Purple hair = purple guys gaurd
Yeah... the mainstream media is not only completely fake, but is also totally off the rails. They are just going insane.

Its not just advertiser pulling out

YouTube accounts for i think close to 51% of all the internet traffic 

Think about 

I bet if Disney bought out YouTube you wouldn‚Äôt have this problem
And now you‚Äôre words are going to be taken out of context to blame you because they refuse to accept the blame for what they do
I like your hair
This is America
Respect MatPat
You are so passionate about these topics.
I love it!
Thank you for everything.
give this man a speech award
Yeahp, totally worth watching!
I just don't understand people on the elite. They are so... disconnected. Is not like they want to use the REAL 'influencers' and acknowledge the true community of You Tube, they want to shape the influence and the community, while the community is actively refusing the status quo. And You Tube itself does not help either, because You Tube hates what it has always been: broadcast yourself.
Oh no he's on a couch!!!  I feel like I did something wrong
The world is crazy man... we are LITERALLY, as a community, begging this advertisers giants to advertise to us, to sell US their products, that we could buy them... and they refuse because they hate new media THAT much.
üòÆ oh oh! we are more on gaming and... a 9 year old trying to make videos. Good luck to us then.  Ty for this video
MatPat I would just like to say that I am doing a whole English project based on your videos about gamers not being aggressive and your videos have taught me things school can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt and I‚Äôve been able to use what I learn in your videos to support big arguments that people don‚Äôt know the actual truth or don‚Äôt know how things actually Just a warm honest thank you from a 6 year long theorist THANK YOUüòä
SHADE
Just like radio was terrified of television taking over, traditional media is terrified of new age, online social media taking over, thus they choose to lie, manipulate, and present YouTube and other forms of social media as evil. It may work for a bit short-term, but in the long run we'll prevail.
youtube is becoming a broken place and they need people like matpat to help and fix it
In 5 min this better #1 on trending. Like if u agree
This could be AKA'd as "the roast of advertisers"
your face in google stadia conference
THANK YOU!!
I needed to see this. I was really sad about the world but seeing this reminded me that there ARE still good people in it, and not everything is bad news.
And this is why I hate group projects! Some ruins it for everyone!
Never heard something more real.
The reason advertisers dont like gamers is simple
They cant advertise to us, all we see is the advertisment... not the context of it
We ignore them, and try to get rid of em, i point to any add-on for Firefox.. chrome.. edge, that gets rid of advertisements
We dont want them, they are an annoyance to us, we dont even register what the advertisement is

Thats why they dont liek gamers, becuase we see past their bullshit, they cant advertise to us (unless its game related.. in which case, we tend to Hype the thing into oblivion)
No therapist worth a damn would support transgender KIDS! i'm sorry but as someone who suffered for 22 years with gender dysmorphia it is not always the right idea to switch genders. I woke up one day at 22 and it was gone over night poof for no real reason and at nearly 28 it has never come back. A child has not experienced puberty they don't understand what gender is. And the parents don't understand how telling them it's a CHOICE messes up people's brains, gender isn't a choice it's how your brain is wired. Gender stereotypes and likes and dislikes are being misinterpreted, cross dressing and liking make up as a boy isn't being transgender watch Ru paul it's on the same level as a girl liking football. And the result is people detransitioning with more problems.
Guess what gender dysmorphia doesn't go away for most people who have transitioned it's a misconception. 
A lot of time people just have self hate that needs therapy and whatever they look like they still hate themselves. 
Some times it's an undiagnosed mental illness like mine was and with the right help it just goes away. 
It complex issue and should NEVER be considered before puberty, we don't diagnose children as psychopaths we shouldn't be saying they are trans yet either.
Let them be neutral if they are feeling uncomfortable, let them have 'they' no gender pronouns at all.
Taking someone out of one box and shoving them into another doesn't help. If they want to wear a dress fine, if they want to have a shaved head fine, it doesn't need to be gendered.
That‚Äôs a Disney shirt
Bull crap
This is what we needed. Charismatic men saying whats going on instead of biased news sources telling their side, if mat ran for president, i'd vote for him. He wouldnt let our country down with his intelligence and charisma.

The captain EO shirt turns me on
this video is so powerful, it was so empowering for about 70-80% of the video but the other 20-30% of it was so painful and it's not so much about MatPat's content is more so what he's talking about.


jeez when you talk about how BS and hypocritical it is the way gamers (in general) are treated it's kind of insane. we're talking about some people who've been bullied a lot as kids, abused by others or whatever else that made video games our escape. i imagine most gamers are selfless at heart because we don't like the feeling of being down, we wanna empower others.


Matpat, this vid was so painful to watch near the end but I can only imagine how painful it was to write it, plan it, make a vid about it and talk about it near the end. knowing full well that the people doing good on this platform aren't treated as well as those that are usually doing bad. i have great respect for you for doing this, that takes a lot of strength.
Noooo keep your hair dyed plzzzzz
Sounds like matpat needs to create a gaming video platform and move all gamers there, instead of YouTube.
That couch must ignite rants and seriousness in Matpat because when it starts like this you know it‚Äôs serious.
You‚Äôre a good man Matpat. I‚Äôm proud to have been a subscriber to this channel for the longest time. The ability to be as brave as you are to sit there and stand up for this wonderful platform and it‚Äôs creators is award worthy. Thank you for your words and thank you for all the support you give to the good people of YouTube. üêà
It's online. It's "new". They don't understand it. So it must be bad.
Why isn't this trending he's done this before and it trended youtube is trying to keep this off the media
well said MatPat.  I think I can say for most of us here is that we are tried of all this negative vibe in the air. Doesn't the world promote positivity and goodwill to all men and peace on earth? What happened to that? We didn't start the fire and I for one refuse to give in to that flame anymore. (reference to something, I will let you decide what I referenced)
Wow. I have no words. I am just shocked. thank you for opening my eyes with this topic.
I saw that molecule behind Mat and thought, I bet that's caffeine.  One google later, yep that's caffeine.
Mat pat is a gang weeder
chapeau
It really crushes me that YouTube is falling apart little by little. And most of it is because of Advertisers. I thought YouTube was a place where you can truly be you. And this is getting ruined by people who think that YouTube is a place of laziness & sloth. 
Why I am feeling down about this is because I know my favorite YouTubers are doing such a well job on doing everything they can to make the world a better place. Heck! Even better than Ad's! 
And... Like I said... A majority of people are not accepting it to the fullest. Even other companies.
I really love YouTube. I have been dreaming to be a YouTuber for years now. I feel like YouTube is the only place where you can show who you truly are... And if people & critics don't like who we are right now. All we have to do is just... Prove them wrong. YouTube can bring people together. Along with it's amazing YouTubers. And if you are planning to be a YouTuber one day... Then reach for that goal! Show the world who you really are! 
Let us be the next generation of AWESOME! Because we are.
Thank you.

Mat, you‚Äôre top-tier in my book üëèüèº
ü§î
I LOVE YOU FOR SEVERAL REASONS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM
No, this was incredible and it needs to go viral. Well done, as always, MatPat.
GET EM MATPAT. 
I'm glad you're raising awareness and exposing this stuff. I cant speak for everyone, but I'm proud of your whole team.
When I read people saying that MatPat is a huge narcissist I get really confused because he does this kind of stuff in which he passionately defends the people he cares about, and the good deeds that they've done. If you notice, there are just two times on the video that draws attention to MatPat doing good actions and he didn't even mention the $200, 000 dollars that The Game Theorists raised for Mental Health.

I mean, yes, he did mention that they did some livestreams (not only the Mental Health one but also the one for the Hurricane Relief in Texas), but when it came to the actual hard data he didn't brag about the amount of money that they raised, he specifically talked about how much others helped. A narcissist could never do that, and all of this just shows how a great example Mat is setting to us as well.

We are really proud of you, Mat. The world needs people like you, not only because you are smart and do analytical thinking, but also because you are willing to enlighten us about this kind of issues that no one else talks about, and you are definitely putting out there a lot of good that is indeed needed and that I'm sure will return back to you. You inspire us to be better people.

Also, I loved that you mentioned SuperCarlinBrothers (everyone else too, as well, but I've been following them for a while now), they do a great job and I always wanted them to be recognized or to work with you, especially since both of your channels tend to focus on theories and speculation about fiction.

Thanks for everything, MatPat. You are really someone worthy of being looked up to.
I'm very god damn sorry, this is an amazing video and oh my god finally someone is ACTUALLY talking about it, but like.....

When he said "see, that's the real problem here" I thought he was legitimately going to say "see, that's the real tea-"...... I watch too much Shane dawson and Kpop meme channels....
Wow.. Keep spilling that scorching fire brother.. Near the end it started to hit me hard on knowing that someone is finally talking about this..
I hope soon this incident or problem would resolve
let's all make that happend
A plus and I support you 100 percent.
Video: Matpat is purple üëç. And rantsüëé.
How is NO ONE noticing his Captain EO shirt. Nice shirt
You worked with LEGO a mat pat LEGO would be cooooool
Pretty fantastic analogy to minorities in the US, tbh. Focusing on the minuscule bad portion of a community  and ignoring the massive amount of work they've done to improve society.
maybe its the Captain Eo shirt...
YOU GO MATPAT!!!
When you search youtuber on google and go to news, it's really difficult to find an actually positive story.
I'm trying to learn wing dings
Get this on trending!
Emmm... Is that Michael Jackson on his shirt ://
Yay more rant theories.






This isn't sarcasm I actually enjoy his opinions and rants.
Adpocalypse translation from "made up word" English to meme:
thank you for your honesty Mat! Sometimes it is really needed to speak up for the truth, no matter how hard it is, someone really has to! I'm really happy someone like you is not afraid to speak up and use his influence to do something good, to tell about the unseen good you guys are doing. 
I'd like to think those 4k+  downvotes are all people not bothered enough to watch thought the whole video. Maybe it was a rant, but a really important one. I don't think enough people understand how important it is what you're doing or why medias and presses are doing what they are doing against you guys. It's all another topic but something that might give everyone a rough idea of what's going on is that youtubers are actually helping people with anxiety, mental disorders and such things way better than what the mental health system is doing right now - Not saying they are professionals nor that what they do is enough to avoid someone hanging himself all the time, I'm saying that they are doing more without ever visiting a patient than what an actual psychiatrist can do visiting and medicating someone via mainstream health care. Whoever like me has gone through some of that can tell you the same (to be clear, if I'm not hanging myself it's not because there are youtubers cheering me up during the day, but they create comunities where you feel like you belong, as Matpat was explaining, and that's a partial medicine itself already). 


 if you're interested about why it's so important to feel like you belong somewhere, or why it is so important for the mental health worldwide, I'd suggest you guys to check this video.  maybe you know her maybe you don't, what I ask of you is just to listen without prejudice. she speaks the truth no matter what they say about her. I'm not a fan, I've no personal (egoistic) interest in this, that's just my most honest opinion - she's probably the most truthful person on the planet, no matter the topic. Maybe you can't see it, but her mind and emotions are completely naked in every video. I REALLY suggest you to check that out.
You forgot about this French Streamer, Zerator with his Zevent that raised alone more than 1 000 000 euros in 1 week end with more than 30 streamers/youtubers participating
Dis video is really good keep up the good work but HEY that‚Äôs just a theory a GAME theory
You have such a big heart Matpat and a passion for justice. I‚Äôm glad I found your Chanel üòä
Love you Matt, but it's been proven that it was actually Depp being abused by his ex wife, the whole testimony and many images are around on google <3
This video is actually golden and should be watched by everyone!
Get work, but seriously a lot of the things you been pointing out towards the end is what us on the right been saying for years and we been called every name in the book because of it.
Man that made me emotional
You need a podcast
You just summed up the entire reason I keep watching YouTube. It seems to be the only safe and positive place to be anymore. Most of the friends I have now, I met because we liked the same channels. I have so much love for you guys as creators and feel such a debt of gratitude for the things multiple creators have helped me get though.
Thank you.
You know what who wants to start a Crusade and get all his serious videos and link them on trending?
6:34 um... do I spy with my little eye Caleb Hyles?! It‚Äôs awesome you put him on the list!!
MatPat spilling that truth tea.
This video is proof that gamers are truly the most oppressed minority on the planet
Keep it up Matpat. You're making headway bro. Keep pushing. You have the numbers.
Game Theory and Film Theory in the same room? Is this a crossover episode?
So gamers ARE the most oppressed society.
MattRant

Rant Theory

What about film theory
Matt Johnny Depp is just recently proven innocent ;;
Still doesn't change the point proven, but it would be nice to be cleared that he's also on the victim side
Thank you #MatPat for the best news I've heard on YouTube, ever.

I'm not crying... my eyes are just sweaty af.
I'm commenting because this needs more attention.
I plead you, DON'T BECOME A TOP 10 CHANNEL
Remember when you said that tseries will pass pewdiepie in a month, 5-6 months ago? Yeah, you failed!
This phenomenon you are ranting about is just one battle in a way larger struggle: It can easily be broken down to online versus traditional media. Classical media corporations against online media corporations. This fight is fought on several fronts: through legislation: take the current EU copyright reform and its infamous Article 13, for instance, which is a brilliant move by traditional media and their lobbyists to strike against their online competitors. They have the money, they have the lobbyists, they have the advertisers. So far, it looks like the traditionalists are winning every battle, at least as long as "Generation Newspaper" is still alive and a majority. My fear is that the online community will be irreparably damaged by the time "Generation Online" is taking over. At least there is hope that something completely new will rise from the ashes.

So, of course, google and all its plattforms will not get positive press (literally) as this would be friendly fire in the on-going war for publicist souvereignty.
DoN‚Äôt wOrrY GUys, WonT RANt thIs TiMe
Matt Shapiro
How am i first?






Nani?
More angry couch!
I think the truth is that the press and traditional media feel threatened by YouTubers. Traditional media is dying (Newspapers etc). I feel like they view online creators as the competition. I think it also annoys them that most of us havent spent years at University studying degrees. The media give us a bad name and I think thats why brands are scared to work with us. For fear traditional media will hold them up and try to make an example of them.
It's been a literal 9 days lololol
his shirt is gorg
Gamers are mid lvl Youtubers huh?
I mean it's not like the biggest channel on YouTube is a gaming channel.
The 1.6k dislikes on this video are from advertisers
We need to get this to 1 on trending so YouTube can see this
He should just make another channel called Rant Theory
These serious MatPat videos are gonna change the world, PERIODT.
This is wasn‚Äôt trending?
At first I thought Matpat was gonna "Expose" some famous channels
I was wrong
And BOY did that hit me like a truck holding 300 pounds of metal.
Youtuber: can I have adds 

YouTube: Yes but actually no
Shoutout to MFPT and existence appreciation day or whatever he calls it :S
No No (dieing of chring)
Preach it, MatPat!!! üôåüèæ
"the" childish gambino XD
Dam right MATPAT !!!
For some reason this reminds me of politics
Please notice me
YouTube is ironically vary discriminatory
Don't forget, Matt...bad press is the only one that people want to read!  I work at a hotel, and when people ask about how much the papers we leave out cost, I tell them they're free (because they are).  Its all the bad news they can handle...because printing GOOD news dosn't sell papers, or get people to watch TV news.  The good stories get ignored in favor of the bad, just so that they can show how horrible everything is.  If there's great things happening, they won't show it.  If its bad though...watch out, the news shows will be all over it like flies on a rotting fruit.
commenting for the algorithm

Damn.. People hate gamer huh
Yes Matt pat





Or should I say rant pat







PREACH
MatPat
Please run for president one day.
Thanks.
My English teacher used to say, The fault of one is the fall of all..
Has it been considered that the influencers mentioned in this video have a sufficient audience to put real pressure on advertisers? Imagine if the top 10 influencers on YouTube asked their audience to boycott McDonald‚Äôs or Pepsi or Starbucks...even for a set time, say for instance, one week or even just a weekend...imagine the response. Just a little shot across their bow to let them know that YouTubers and other influencers hold serious power in the minds and hearts of their fans and followers. 

Idk, I‚Äôm just sayin.
So I‚Äôm also pointing out there are a lot of veterans who watch a lot and find communities on youtube. Black rifle, gruntstyle, ranger up. All of them, hell even demolition ranch are places that honor veterans and show military people they aren‚Äôt alone and put out stuff to prevent vet homelessness and depression. Tons of money from them gets donated to vet outreach
Love your video and completely agree! apart from the johnny depp part, if you look up the case hes provided endless proof that his ex-wife has been making everything up! apart from the brilliant video!
I honestly think you and supercarlinbrothers should collab.....it would be my dream crossover episode.....I honestly think it would be fun...
Thanks for making me cry like a baby Mat Pat üòÇüò≠ YouTubers really deserve the world. You all create so much joy in our lives.
Go MatPat! It actually really gave me comfort to see him so passionate and well spoken, saying things more concisely and eloquently than anyone has been able to do yet. I hope this video gains more and more traction.
The Johnny Depp example very quickly became... not immediately wrong as I'm still waiting for a verdict on the whole thing, but the latest information muddies the waters.
You're doing good work man.  Fight the power.
No, you should keep it purple. It looks really good on you.
Funny me, I can't focus. I keep looking at the hair! Wkwk.. üòÇ
not only is the point good, he's a fantastic orator. especially given that a bunch of that seemed to be off the top of his head? you'd expect there to be a bunch of jumpcuts but nope, just him streamofconsciousnessing.
YouTubers: makes millions of dollars for charity
Media: didn't see it didn't happen
Damn I love this channel
Lego game theory set would be awesome have a little LEGO theory logo
Hey Matpat, it looks like some evidence has come out showing Amber Heard to be the abuser in the case of Johnny Depp's situation, the deal is developing, but it's very much looking like she was the one being abusive in the relationship. I don't blame you for listing him off because everyone believed he had been the abuser, but it would be a good thing to put something up regarding that.
i like your micheal jackson shirt matpat
Just saying the purple hair is kinda cute...
Never forget Mumkey.
NYAN!!!!!
Gronkh hat schon immer seinen Teil zu getragen
GAMERS, RISE UP!
A lot of people think "wtf does a gamer even do? Why are people so crazy about games?"... My own parents think "what is so special about games?" and I get scolded for watching Mark's or Jack's Let's-Plays or MatPat's theory videos....
Games are an epitome of joy and entertainment for us. They are platforms where we can be ourselves, do what we love, and YouTube gamers ARE influencers 'cause they make me not wanna give up on life!..... Who says gamers don't have a life? We choose to have many!!! And do good in each of them......
Man, MatPat is pushin hard for that ‚Äòhigh-tier influencer‚Äô title



Jk good and meaningful video
So this video has over a million views and is not on the trending page, yet there are videos with less than 500k views and trending. Interesting YouTube.... interesting.
Thanks for showing creators that are also not american. As a german, I was really happy to seeing Gronkh in the video
I feel like this time when I say this, I should say even more enthusiastically this time...
GAMERS... RISE UP!!!!!
the moment you said james charles you almost ruined the video
I was actually wondering why it's on game theory not film theory
You should try to get on Joe Rogan he will host you for sure
Wow, just wow! I don't know what I expected when I clicked on this video, and it definitely wasn't something like this, but it was so wholesome and powerful that I have to salute you. Well done, Mat Pat!
When May Pat talks be prepared to listen. What he says is very good and I wish the people with the money would pay attention. He should have big companies running to advertise on his videos!
I like a Michele Jackson shirt I think its kind of funny even if it wasn't done on purpose
I got no adds on tho video. Lol.
That Mic drop tho
u should run for the president
Matpat for president
your great
14:16 WHY IS THE CHILD LOOKING AT PLEASE ME?!?! this guys parents needa put on that bad video filter mode thingamajink
3:13
Don't worry, you're allowed to make cringy jokes since you're a dad now.
Matt is the speaker of truth.
Mark and jack are the most charitable people i know.
Dang... people hate gamers, even though they are the most giving people on youtube.
Im not finished but this proved my idea on how advertising is.
This should have been in 2018 YouTube rewind.  First it would not be cringe, and second it would have been more authentic.
IWANTMOREMATPATONCHAIR
Mayby ill go on all the trending videos and link this one.
I feel like we need ANOTHER channel specifically for sit downs like this, with regular or at least semi regular content.
It isn't narcissistic or anything. These people deserve credit not just for the dollar amount, but for the direction they go. Matpat out here shouting about Talos again, preach it theorists.
The Rant Theorists channel! 




Joking aside, i'm with you matpat
Thank you so much for doing this. We need this kind of recognition for our fellow creators, from our fellow youtubers, because the old media who fear us replacing them won't give it to us.
I love your bring to light/rant videos! The truth needs to be known!! Your amazing Matpat!
5:36 Hey @MattsWhatItIs you‚Äôre on Game Theory now
Now I'm scared of starting a  youtube channel T-T

Me RIPü§£
"I'm not gonna sit here and rant" rants :O
The day we see Gronkh in a Game Theory video has come, wonderful.
oh, how I wish the media never existed. if you think about it, they are completely irrelevant and not necessary to anyones day.
SAVE THIS VIDEO PEOPLE because it‚Äôs important to never forget how important it is to have agency!! 

Yes! Keep up the charity work and good works so the media CAN‚ÄôT ignore this form of media anymore. 

Do your part for the betterment of media and entertainment. Rich and hypocritical celebrities shouldn‚Äôt be able to have such a tight grip on controlling the news industry when it‚Äôs only to benefit them.

Keep up the good work!
Hey flip you 4.7 mil people who dislike this vid this is a gud vid that people need to see
MatPat spilling the tea, and it's piping hot.
Guys, I get no benefit, but if u get Brave browser you can avoid all ads, having a built-in ad blocker. Sorry creators, no yellow circle-blockers
Haha slick end
You know, Matpat is right! YouTube changed my life! I had little to no friends all my life! When I discovered YouTube, I felt like I belonged here! Here with Matpat and all the others I watch! It‚Äôs so sad how one of the nicest and most positive communities out there are pushed under the bus so quickly when celebs are forgiven IMMEDIATELY!! I LOVE THIS COMMUNTIY!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è And no one can take it away!!

(I fixed it now, I only just noticedüòÖü§£üòÇ)
And once again this shows that gamers is the most suppressed race
JonTron also raised 50,000 dollars for charity during a livestream a few months ago
I will never forget when someone commented on one of my videos how much better I was then them, and I looked at their art and realized that they were amazing. I told them that their art was really good and they told me that no one had ever said that to them and how people always bully them for their art. They also told me how happy they were to hear that. Even though I am a super small YouTuber, I had enough power to make someone happy, and that's what I believe that so many other channels out there are trying to do. It makes me so sad that gamers are considered the scum of the internet when they change so many lives, which is why this video needs to be publicized. Those advertisers and big name companies need to check their facts and show us, the REAL us and all the good we can do as YouTubers.
"Don't worry, no non-canon stuff like Smash Bros"
5 minutes later
"Tony Hawk"
Infinity war: This is the most ambitious crossover yet
the entire gaming industry: Hold my beer
So basically,




A gamers wet dream.
Who else click this thinking it was a purely a kingdom hearts theory
My sister was in a Tic Toc that Pewdiepie watched in his videos. Elon musk hosted meme review with Justin Roiland. He made a show on adult swim, which is a Cartoon Network subsitderary. Adventure Time is owned by CN. That had a mashup pack in Minecraft, which also had a Mario Mashup Pack. Therefore, I am connected to this, and will be called by marvel any day now to star in Avengers Endgame
MatPat go home you're drunk on diet coke
What about splatoon



YOU FORGOT SPLATOON
Edit:wuuut so many likes!?
Matpat: makes completly normal theory 
Some people: This is boring!!! It didn‚Äôt blow my mind
Matpat: makes sorta crazy idea for theory (this vid) 
Some people: this isn‚Äôt normal!!! It‚Äôs to crazy and unbelievable!!
Matpat: ?????

Edit: 43 likes!!!!! Thx so much that‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever gotten!!!!
Don't you dare say a legendary game series like Kingdom Hearts is connected to Fortnite. DON'T you EVER say that
"You don't have to heal sora if you're already dead" has me rolling on the floor XD
This video is basically mat playing with his imagination
This Quote really Hits me in every Mat's Videos
 "BUT HEY"
"IT'S JUST A THEORY"
"A GAME THEORY"
MatPat advertises Coca Cola Light for free (NOTSPON) and Jacksepticeye advertises Coca Cola Zero for free (NOTSPON). Matthew Patrick
 is Se√°n McLoughlin confirmed.
NOW THIS IS THE MOST AMBITOUS CROSSOVER OF ALL TIME
The most ambitious crossover in history: doom, dead space, and prey.
I got you Matt
PunchOut has Mike Tyson
Real Life has Mike Tyson.
Real Life has every single franchise ever.
Therefore, every franchise is connected. Can't wait to see Sans and Winnie the Pooh teaming up on the Battle Bus, while Tetris Blocks rain from the sky.
You forgot Final Fantasy XV has a Half-life pack which means the half life universe is connected in this.
Now i wanna see Doom guy getting a portal gun and helping gordon taking care of the combine.
Splinter cell also links into ghost recon which links into the division  rainbow six siege and Predator which then connects to Alien and Prometheus but Alien connects to Batman and the rest of the DC universe which then connects to Mortal Kombat which then connects to Friday the 13th which connects to Nightmare on elm street Halloween and Saw. And when you mentioned Far Cry that also links to PUBG and possibly IT! And PUBG also links to Jurassic Park/World because of the winter map. And in Jurassic Park 2 there is a person running from a T. rex in the city scene there is a guy who possibly mentions Godzilla which then goes into King Kong.
At first when doom guy went through the door, I thought it was half life... lol

I also really like these cool connected universe theories
This also means FF is connected to Forza since that Regalia car is in FH3 and 4
Honestly... don't think this is it chief.
Forgot all of the other big series like COD. Ray Gun MK2 takes down any other character. bcuz headshot dps is over 9000^2
3:35 totally thought that was Edna mode from incredibles
Imagine a game where every developer / publisher participates in making said game and literally every single video game character in existence comes together and works together for the greater good of whatever plot that game has in store. With Kingdom Hearts being the main "leader" of the game and thus Sora is the one that every "Good Karma character" and even the Neutral characters in video game history help out. With every single bad guy in video game existence helping out the Master of Masters or someone else. It'd be like Ready Player One but much more intense, longer, emotional, just everything. That game would go down in history as the best entertainment product of all time and then the video game industry could shut down on a good note IF something like that were to happen.


Crossovers would become an understatement of a word.
We all know the best conmected universe is the Arrowverse.
Um...are you OK, MatPat?  This one seemed a bit...yah.  Well.  Hmm.  Uh...OK, then.
Dang now the FBI is after me
Now link all this to the dark souls series, that would be epic!
WAIT.  if john wick is in fortnite and in payday 2 doesn't that mean all of the payday 2  collaborations  would also be cannon like enter the gungeon and goat simulator. plus goat simulator also has Easter eggs in it. soooooo this is like a new side of the theory
But Noctuis is a fighter in tekken including walking dead with negan  so the universes gets even bigger
He won't make another crossover theory. 
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.
He won't make another crossover theory.





He made a crossover theory. Darn.
OH
MY
GOD


DOOM can be linked to Final Fantasy...
Final Fantasy connects to Forza Horizon 3 by the car they drive....
And Forza connects everything to the other green marine


the one 


the only 

MASTER CHIEF AND DOOM SLAYER CAN FINALLY DESTROY ALIENS AND HELLSPAWN TOGETHER
6:08
you really did this
you did the joke
hope you're proud of yourself
OR DOES IT!? dUN DUn DuN!! Yes yes it does..
And thor plays fortnite in endgamw
Look...matpat, just make a video of you drinking diet coke...it doesn't have to be long...please just do it
Doomguy with Rico destorying just cuase
If Wreck It Ralph was canon, wouldn't that essentially connect every single game together? ü§î
GET. THAT TERRIBLE GAME FORTNITE. OUT OF HERE NOW.
Infinity wars is the most ambitious crossovers ever
Matpat theories : hold my games
What did you bring upon this cursed land
This was a real stretch but I love this
Doom Guy is also able to cross into Monster Hunter, and then the Witcher, because there‚Äôs FF characters in MH, along with Geralt from the Witcher. I want to hunt Rathalos with my double barrel Doom shotgun
7:33 so, roblox is connected to doom? They had a sponsorship with infinity war and endgame so...
you forget DARKSOULS
do hat in time theory pls i love that game
Game Theory: Into the MatPativerse
The Diet Coke box says serving size: 1 can, not 12
Sadness...just completely left Halo out of this...(someone may argue CoD relates to Halo but nah fam)
MatPat : "no non canon sources"

.
.
.
MatPat : "lol bonus characters in a skating game"


Suuuuure
Rebuttal to your theory:

Fortnite is trash.

I rest my case.

P.S. Tony Hawk is worse canonically than Smash or All-Stars.
Once you consider Soul Caliber you can go full loop... Yoda/Vader/Link/Ezio/Gerald...the list goes on.
Alternate Title:
Doomguy kills literally everyone
Do a theory on smoke‚Äôs canister from rainbow six siege
Mat: makes an entertaining video

Comments: um acTUALLY
03:37 josh dem dare some flash backs too that ohair guy
DOOM GUY VS ≈†P≈òƒÆ√ëG≈§≈ò√ÅP
Not again, MatPat! First, the Sans is Ness video, now this! I thought we talked about this!
"Commander Keen... you ARE the father!"
Sounds like somebody had a theory while taking a shower
back ground I meant back ground.  of this channel you now the picture of him with
the thought bubble of Mario,  nugget, Freddy, pikachu, and JUST MONIKA
Just saying, the Kingdom Hearts timeline is about as confusing as....





Well, there is nothing as confusing as the plot-line of Kingdom Hearts. 
I have a question. 








HOW THE HECK DOES SOAR HAVE 3 OTHER HEARTS INSIDE OF HIM?!?!?!
Is this your biggest one yet?
Never thought of this video matpat. But you forgot about something lethal in the video game timeline.





Rayman..
Not only is he ubisoft, he has had several cameos or possibly even parts in popular gaming. He has battled alongside rabbids his hometown has been in just dance. Not the best one but it‚Äôs still another  more thing, he is a MOJANG ADDED skin in MC. This can also link into every PC game. So Banjo and kazooie, prepare to battle it out with thanos. I don‚Äôt know this one, but apparently he is a playable character in soul hunters as well. Just figured this one out. Rayman also has an uno game linking into the world of cards. And believe it or not. Popcap's Solitare blitz is a card game on mobile. So this links into Popcap's universe. And PVZGW and PVZGW2 is made by Popcap and EA. This also links into the ea games as well.
Good theory, but I would MUCH prefer it if Doom had absolutely no connection to Fortnite.
I got you Matt
PunchOut has Mike Tyson
Real Life has Mike Tyson.
Real Life has every single franchise ever.
Therefore, every franchise is connected. Can't wait to see Sans and Winnie the Pooh teaming up on the Battle Bus, while Tetris Blocks rain from the sky and Purple guy gets frozen by elsa while Doom guy kills him with Charmander, Cuphead and Ballora try to stop Doom guy and Elsa
what about Shin Megami Tensei, Devil May Cry, and Resident Evil?
you could have just said that a Marvel booth appears in Ralph Breaks The Internet and then connect Ralph to kingdom hearts. instead of digging up an irrelevant game to make a half-baked theory.


just a thought.
Matpat: Does a crossover episode
Gabe Newell: Lol, Portal and Half-life are in the same universe
WAIT
DOES THAT MEAN HL3 WOULD BE A CROSSOVER GAME BETWEEN PORTAL AND HALF-LIFE??
You really need a vacation.
Monster hunter has a final fantasy crossover too
8:12
"Disney infinity"
NO WAY
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER HEAR THAT NAME AGAIN!!!
You forgot the rabids which leads to rayman
That intro, perfect representation of what gut does to our child hoods...
"Your theorists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."
Imagine doom guy wasting all his ammo trying to hit sans 



Glorious

Dota 2?
Also part of it.
Marvel vs Capcom
Same, part of it...
When MatPat wants to be in MrBeast's battle royale the vid comes out MatPat isnt in it R.I.P MatPat's dream
I'd also like to add that in FFXV Half-Life's HEV suit exists (as a bonus), that's a whole other can of worms.
Beer üç∫ is amazing
A little early for april fools
Even Reck It Ralph
Hey MatPat! Could you make a theory that deals with the Tomb Raider series? It is my COMPLETE childhood.


Unless you already have one, then...


I overlooked that one lol
I was about to write ‚Äú what about FNAF?‚Äù  
Seconds later you mentioned Fnaf
Being a big Disney infinity fan back In the day I recognised the toy box reference.
How to ruin literally anything: connect it to fortnite in stupid ways
Imagine Scott just asking the creators of Fortnite if they could make a skin for his game (like a boost in revenue and stuff/ shout-out type thing) 


THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
yet stupid
Cause I hate fortnite
Buddy, you gotta stick
to your own rules.
It is like in Wreck it Ralph 
Where he have met Bowser ,the Ghosts of Pac man and others 

Every Video game is connected 

It is Mind-blowing and more complicated than Inception
please don't forget that john wick not only appears in Fortnite, but also as a playable character in Payday 2
Rick and morty portal?






YEET
Hey.
Das enough diet coke for you buuuuddy.

I jk but lumping in Fortnight with Kingdom Hearts is a sin, and you must ask any entity in Smite for forgiveness.
It's weird how you anglicise polish surnames like 'Blazkowicz'
can you make a video on the Wolfenstein, commander keen, Doom and Quake timeline
Wow... This takes "stretching it thin" to a whole new level.
Skylanders is better than amiibo 
Change my mind, I dare you!
This will blow your mind, 
You never tought about this.. 
this question, for shure, will surprise you...
It was the most inportant game for years
And it still now, in 2019 is one of the best selling games

So...


Where is Steve? From minecraft...

Of course, you have minecraft references in the binding of isaac but what else?
...
THE BEST INTRO EVER
But we didn‚Äôt need to wait so long to link Doom to Zelda, Doomguy is already in Zelda ;)
Even better crossover. Elon Musk Hosting Meme Review...
My whole childhood. I'm crying. Thank you. grabs popcorn and plays commander keen
doomguy is 10th class of TF2 confirmed
I miss your old crossover videos!! Even that crossover series you had with I think jwittz?  It was kool.
Wait does Mario kart 8 deluxe count, because if it does, oh boy! We have 3 more worlds

Edit: 2 things 1. I just realized that he mentioned tloz. 2. By worlds, I mean Splatoon and animal crossing
You took a HUGE jump there with Spider-Man into the Spiderverse
I don‚Äôt know if all this includes Halo.
But I would love to see Master Chief fighting side bye side with the Doom Slayer.
Mario is in a boxing game. Mario is in a pinball game.
Mario is in many other games as well...


Mario is the key to everything.
I should be doing my homework now
Why not Minecraft?

Disney infinity man its been years I think now I want to play it 0-0
I don‚Äôt wanna see another video become ‚ÄúSans is Ness.‚Äù Can we all agree that this theory was just to poke fun at the Easter eggs and while it may have many stretches and plot holes, it seems like a video matpat genuinely enjoyed making? He seems so excited about the crazy speculation. Let‚Äôs let him be happy
Also Sam Fisher mentions a reference to Solid Snake in Splinter Cell. So Connect Kojima in with that too.  (Also Raiden in MGS connects cheaply to Playstation characters in All Stars Battle Royale).
‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre gonna yell at me in the comments for saying that they wouldn‚Äôt exist in a toy box , but...I intentionally wrote that to set up this twist.‚Äù
That‚Äôs not setting up a twist. That‚Äôs just lying to the viewers to get them to think that you found something actually hard-hitting and not Disney Infinity, Tony Hawk, and Mario and Sonic Olympics.
In your fake news video you criticized the art of clickbait, but that is essentially what you have done here. You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
The laungage from commander keen is in Minecraft in the enchanting table
there is a theme on some game of final fantasy that sound like gestar theme
so you another crossover
Oh man, i just woke up and am feeling a bit sore... ill need to take a big stretch. Nevermind, this was a bigger stretch than ill ever need

"The lord himself, shrek" -Mat Pat 2019
Infinity war has a cameo with Stan Lee he also cameos in Teen Titans meaning DC is technically also part of this universe
You also forgotten the monster Hunter series

Which is also connected to the Witcher which is also connected to Cyberpunk 2077
Mat has finally gone crazy 
Well just roll with it
MatPat! Your theory about the box in FNAF, Scott said that you were correct! (Dawko interview with Scott)
Hey MatPat have you considered seeing a therapist? I think it would be for the best
I still love the fact that Fortnite's Save the World mode was absolutely ignored.


I don't even think many of the characters have made it over as skins.
Well: Rick and Morty; he has a portal gun which can go to any possible timeline/universe ever.
14:04 
Matpat: Kirby could dine with ratatouille 
 
Me: ITS REMY NOT RATATOUILLE
I have a theory about undertale.
Sans stays Alive after we "kill" him in the genocide run.
Sure he fades but..





We don't hear his soul break.
*pats Goku poster*
It's only a matter of time
Didn‚Äôt include all games though...




Yes, obviously I know that would take too long. I‚Äôm just nitpicking.
Hey mattpatt i suggest you make the most important game theory!

OUR LIFE
When he said shrek I actually thought he was joking
The tones crossover would not work as 
A. Sonic and doom and Nintendo are different 
B. It would not work
And
C. Also fortnight and doom are too different
How about pubg? Aka PLAYERS unknown battlegrounds
It's fun to see you draw all these connections together. I don't believe them for a second, but it's entertaining to think about.
WAIT
SQUARE ENIX MADE ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE THAT MEANS  THAT SORA AND THE DRAGON BORN COULD BE FIGHTING DRAGONS TOGTHER
I think Mat Pat may have gone insane.
I gotta share this with LGR




Also. I wonder where limbo be
And since Mario was the original Jumpman in the original Donkey Kong,then that means Donkey Kong would be included.And Mario and Bowser was in the original Sim City.
HEV Suit in FF XV, while all Valvegames share a common universe, like L4D and even more References in other Games. BOOM! Universe got even bigger
5:45

Now connect Doom to Warhammer.

I want to believe that Kaldor Draigo is a pseudonym of Doom Guy.
They're all connected through the digital screen
DOOMGUY IN THE FINAL FANTASY XII REMAKE LEST GO BETHESDA AND SQUARE ENIX
Just add the Master Chief and things will become chaos!
Noctis battled in the king of iron fist tournament too. And tekken crossed with street fighter and bam, a bunch more connections
Well... Sonic, Pac-Man, Mario, and Ryu all showed up or were referenced in Wreck It Ralph! THEORY!
All the games you just mentioned are also connected to the Lego universe because of Lego games staring marvel characters.
once the vid ended I was thinking about what would happen if doom guy found a way into the Pokemon world let me just say...it was brutal and gruesome...
Purple guy is being tormented somewhere bye Golden freddy or cassidy also the location might be in hell
3:35 , I swear to god I thought that was going to be Edna from the incredibles

Edit: now having seen the end I mean...
If we take smash Bros into consideration,
Little Mac is in smash
Little Mac is from punch out
Mike Tyson is in punch out
Mike Tyson is real......
Put the rest together
Connecting Doomguy to FNAF:

1) The established connections from Doomguy to Into The Spiderverse.
2) Spiderman and the Marvel Universe connected to the DC Universe via the 1996 Marvel vs DC crossover event.
3) The DC Universe and thus, Teen Titans Go, connected to Steven Universe with the crossover event "Crossover Nexus", wherein Raven teams up with Garnet from Steven Universe.
4) In issue 5 of the Steven Universe comic series, plushies of Freddy, Bonnie, and Chica can be seen on Pearl's desk, which can only be manufactured by...

Fazbear Entertainment.
Boom. Doomguy to Purple Guy.
...I'm sorry, but if DoomGuy BJ Blaskowitz III and KEFKA make it to Fortnite Island, I'll actually consider playing the game.
Can I just point out Wreck it Ralph is in Kingdom Hearts universe and with the second film connecting to the internet... The possibilities are infinite!
(Degrees of Kevin bacon intensifies)
1.5 million views already? Jeez the notifications squad is huge
MatPat scares me. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs going crazy. All jokes aside, I love it when Matt goes a little bit crazy, it‚Äôs fun to hear him have fun with something like this. I just hope the Theorists don‚Äôt put a torch to this one...
Prepare a butt ton of pants purpleguy doom (literaly and figuratively)is coming
For YOU!!!
TBH I think that the Splinter Cell connection is a little too far-fetched, seeing as it's already a part of the Tom Clancy universe
These are the insane silly theories that I subbed for
If it was no lethal and just incapacitation based I'd do an irl battle Royale.
Multiverse Theory.
BOOM. Anything is connected.

Saved you precious 15 minutes.
DO A VIDEO ON HOW THE LIGHT FURY CAN CLOAK IN HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ thx
Like mixing children cartoon world with some anime-game stuff weren't enough...
>No Noncanon entries
>Including sports games and Tony Hawk
yeah no that doesn't count
If everything is connected







Kill pap and sans is gonna kill y'all
"Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover event in history"
MatPat: "gaming"
Ok....wow :D


I'm not shure what's going on here but I think my head is broken now
Smash bros ultimate is confirmed to be the actual characters by sakurai and nintendo. That means, Pokemon, Mega man, Pac man, Persona and all the other franchises in smash are also in the multiverse
Mat...are you in love whit A BADASS GUY THAT SHREADS DEMONS INTO 2 AND WILL GIVE YOU DOOM?...



Me 2
5:24

"Later in the level"
Literally like four seconds later
Now this a move from epic games that I can approve
Doom guy could also jump to monster hunter and slay behemoth there üòÇ
Yeah, Commander Keen. That was my very first computer game back in the day.  I still have a 98 VM for it.
BTW Square Enix made the Just Cause series so yeah.... have fun with that.
(my life is a crossover
Our lives is an ultimate crossover)
MatPat:"All video games are connected in the same universe."

Me, an intellectual: "Oh you mean the Omniverse."
He just went from doom to sonic huh
Good thing this is a theory because I would petition for one giant game with all of these characters
PEOPLE OF TV TROPES



HE KNOWS ABOUT THE PANTHEON ! ALERT THE MAIN HOUSE !!!
theory of everything!
nobel prize for matpat.
Isn‚Äôt hell a real place, and didn‚Äôt hell  come to doom guy. If that‚Äôs true purple guy is in hell, so then doom guy can go to hell and meet purple guy.
This was kind of a huuuuge strech in my opinion
Yesssss Disney infinity!!
Fortnite sharing universe with Kingdom Hearts and Doom is the best joke i heard
I detest you. With every fiber of my being.
in final fantasy 15 the exlusive edition you had gordon freeman as the character now doomguy could ruin city 17
When are we getting a Game Theory video on the best Battle Royale game of all time, Tetris 99?
One of my favourite games is fortnite and another is doom. Together they would be GREAT
Forgot Monster hunter:World and The Witcher 3.
You can also add the entire Rainbow 6 games to that Ubisoft list! Tons of references to Assassins Creed!
I am one of the original Spider-Verse comic book saga writers and I approve this message.
You missed one major crossover, in Doom 2016 there is a corpse with a very familiar Skyrim helmet. And this is canonically possible because one of the Daedric planes of Oblivion is described as nothing more than a thousand Realms connected to More.
Love this theory but i like the "Mind of doom slayer" theory more witch by the way the character you play as in the 2016 remake of Doom is the doom slayer not doom guy. Two different people not the same
DOOM, I LOVE IT!!!
Rip matpat‚Äôs dream of being in the 100 battle royale
Damn Templars....
Haha.
Has Matpat finally lost it..? (. _ .)
cant wait for literally every single human being, and probably several animal avatars, calling for MattPatt's head on a pike for this theory.
I don't know if it's drugs you're doing or drug you need to be doing,but Matt you need to step away for the keyboard!!! This was stretching on a level that would make stretch Armstrong  jealous.
Now that's how you begin a game theory episode
5:01-5:07 i'm glad i knew doomguy 3 years ago. Heck, even if i only justed watched the 93's gameplay, which is cool üòÉ
K Matt pat finally lost it.. trying to connect ALL games.. damn
What in the everloving fork was that 
mind blown
MENTIONS FINAL FANTASY

ME: SMASH BROS!!!
Also apparently in 2019,
According to Risk of Rain the war of Slopes happened.
PREPARE
honestly...you had me at scissorman
Hmm...what's the best crossover ever?.... Flashbacks to Jimmy Timmy Power Hour
And doom guy can move it move it with the madigascar crew along with megamind and the monsters vs Aileens  because Shrek was also in madigascar carts
Can you look at Peter griffin (from Family Guy) evil side for theory?
So doomguy can kill demons from the netherrelm from mk with the special forces
LMAO, that is one of the best intros on this channel!
Can fortnite not be used in the same sentence as kingdom hearts ever again?
so Mario is in punch out and so is mike Tyson so this expands to the real world
the only reason i liked this video is because it mentioned shrek
I could see sephiroth and ganon teaming up and using the tri force
Oh my god. They‚Äôre all connected. THEORY! DOOM AND PEACH HAD CAPTAIN KEEN
I guessing this video was originally a theory that solved the kingdom hearts story, but instead matpat went insane trying to solve it and made this theory instead,
We can have Shrek, Thanos and Waluigi in the same room.
Can we have a legit KH theory? I was thinking something about who the unknown girl is in KH3 or what exactly happened to Sora
Ummm, Matpat, you know how much Shrek can open up a new can of worms
ok so where does Dark Souls fall into this?
10/10 Theory






"More Confusing than Kingdom Hearts"
Let's not forget the Final Fantasy XV /Nier Automata crossover
Wreck-it Ralph.

That is all.
"While still remaining canon. There are no Playstation Royale or Smash Brothers cross-overs here." proceeds to use Tony Hawk Pro Skater as a linking hub.
You know a lot of these franchises have locations in our world, MEANING ITS REAL
Can‚Äôt wait to see Kirby in fortnite season 8
When your a theorist but drink lot of diet coke in a day
Holy shitballs... Commander Keen!  I've been looking for the title to that game for years and years and years! I played it as a tiny kid and could not remember the name of the game for the life of me...
The original Doom games were about Doom Guy though. The reboot in 2016, follows the Doom Slayer. They're canonically different characters I thought?
You also forgot about some other games, like Undertale, really man, also, do a terraria theory please, it is awesome.
You missed something. Final Fantasy connects to Monster Hunter World. The behemoth from final fantasy takes a visit to the New World. This also connects to The Witcher. Geralt of Rivia also took a trip to the New World to hunt down an Ancient Leshen. Monster Hunter has also had crossovers with other Nintendo and Capcom properties.
I'm starting to feel left out
I got my stitch 2.0 max level in Disney infinity
Commander Keen was (still is) one of my favourite game series
Old school DOOM! AWESOME!!!
Now I understand why it's called DOOM
My head hurts








Literately, I have a headache...
I was laughing so hard when you said Shrek üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wow! I totally understand! Every franchise is connected! 
Can't wait to see Bendy from BATIM and Isabel from ACNL meet for a crossover!
In legend of zelda ocarina of time pictures of mario appear an in breath of the wild there is a xenoblade chronicle mission
Calling it now, Kingdom Hearts 4 reveals Doomguy is the Master of Masters.
BUT WHAT IF  purple guy is thanos? #justforlolz
This is Hilarious! I love it! Amazing, just amazing! Maybe there someday will be an epic crossover of all video game franchises.
Looks to me like Wolfenstein Youngblood will be giving us the missing generation in the Blazkowics family, one of Bj‚Äôs daughters will have Billy Blaze as their son.
Small addition forza horizon 4 has the car from FF15.
13:30 see, the Doom Slayer is a reincarnation of Link.
So, everything is based on a Tony hawk's skin ?
I don't like the idea :/
MatPat: How Fortnite- 
Entire Fan-Base: 1.7 Million Views
Make a theory about season 7 and season 8 after you do the season 7 one I know it's already season 8 but can you do one in season 7 before you season 8
since we were able to connect God of War in that old episode that means Shovel Knight is also in the Universe which means Battletoads are also connected to this universe.
And, Marvel has Marvel vs Cap Com so Mega Man vs Kefka!
IMAGINE DOOMGUY AND SAMUS SLAYING ALIENS SIDE BY SIDE

AM I ALLOWED TO SHIP
Haven't watched the video, but by the title alone I think this video is another "Nes is Sans".
im sorry, tee-dus? you mean TIDUS? LIKE TAI-DUS
In the day of March 6, we have mat making a rant a day before this
this is like 6 Degrees to Kevin Bacon, Extreme Edition
Forget Doom Slayer being on Fortnite, how come almost nobody thought about DOOM x Mortal Kombat?!
# fortnite in the description for those 9 yr old clicks
That intro had me laughing myself to death.....
Welp, all the companies have to comply now.
F in the chat for my brain
Fortnite being connected to any other game is a sin
Will you be in mr beasts YouTuber Battle Royale
BRO, DISNEY INFINITY IS THE SHIZNIT!! I STILL HAVE IT AND FOECE MY SISTER I PLAY IT WITH ME üòÇüòÇ
Also yesterday a new Fortnite character was added who looks like the Doom Guy.
11:30 and Rikku in two the Chearfull one not the angsty one
You're telling me.. that nekopara is in the same universe as PewDiePie's YouTube simulator?
Super Smash Bros Ultimate Melee: Literally everybody is here, (including Doomguy, COD Guy, and Fortnite Default Skin) A new group of enemies threatens the Multiverse, and everything seems lost...

... Until Sakurai frees him from his prison. 

Waluigi is free. 


(P.S. in later Tony Hawks we also get TMNT, among other universes as well. Screw it, Throw smash in. Everything is canon. Everything is connected. Free your mind. It‚Äôs no longer a theory. It‚Äôs truth.)
Music man is just creepy robot spider man their fnaf connected
This is the most tinfoil theory I think I‚Äôve ever seen on this channel
Hey, what do ya think about a video on Rapture's location in Bioshock 1 and 2 ? :)
Hm ... Cut back on the diet coke matpat
But how is Delta Rune connected to Animal Crossing?
Sonic even connects to Angry Birds through Angry Birds Epic
This seems like it should‚Äôve been an April Fools joke
this is basically sans is ness 2
but worse
Hey... This really is a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if we can exploit the popular YouTube algorithm.‚Äù
Kratos and Doom Guy, trolling through Hades, Helheim, Hell, and Mars, leaving nothing but destruction in their wake.
Another franchise that isn't included is Team Fortress 2.
OH MY GOD!!! DISNEY INFINITY BRINGS BACK SONE OLD MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD!!! I hate that it was discontinued. It was my favorite game.
Don't Worry Mat it will come... eventually.
Kingdom Hearts is already confusing enough let alone adding a whole new series to the franchise
If mr. beast does a 100 youtuber battle royale I want in...I have 24 subs and I want in. I‚Äôm like that joke character that no one take seriously but lasts till like the last three episodes and everyone‚Äôs sad to see him go but kinda relieved that he won‚Äôt be around to mess up the climax
KEFKA IN FORTNITE? NOW THATS MONEY MAKING
PLEASE DO A SIMS THEORY (its a lot more complex and connected then youd think)
Mat don't you mean h-e-double toothpicks
Kirby, the incarnation of evil
                     VS
DoomGuy, the john wick of pc gaming

PAY $12 TODAY TO SEE, LIMITED TIME ONLY
(If you get eaten or shot, we are not to be held accountable)
1:37 I agree I‚Äôm a kid but I hate root beer it‚Äôs gross! Edit: I don‚Äôt like diet soda either I keep spitting after I drink it, so yeah
Do the Tommy westphall universe on film theory
I just made a really low-quality comic for a Fnaf Undertale fan game. Technically, FnafTale is a legit AU. Knowing that in the Fanverse, Ink Sans helps create ALL AUs, that links Don‚Äôt Forget to my AU. A version of Fnaf is now connected to the web... Even if it‚Äôs not the real Fnaf. Purple Guy is getting what he deserves.
KH: full of confusing and unexplained lore, plot twists, and symbolism ripe for theories and interpretation
Game theory: FoRtNiTe x Kh
Matt, are you saying that not only does the Doom Marine has a name to follow, but he "COULD" cross over to the FF games or take on the Gods of GoW?! Stop! You don't know what you're doing to me! You're going to... oh no... it's happening! Mind implodes as all the possibilities develop into a mental singularity, as an explosion would just could not capture the fullest effect possible

You made my childhood scream with joy like a kid that had 25 Jumbo pixie sticks in a crowded Walmart.
Wait i want to more crossovers like Hello neighbor, or minecraft, bendy, and my most favorite  GAMES OF THEM ALL CUPHEAD AND DOKI DOKI!!!!! :)
That feeling you get when he didn't mention Minecraft


Minecraft: I'm a joke to you?
Someone enjoys being crazy into a new, unfathomable level...
Oh and since the internet is connected, which means memes, that means Sonic and Sanik could meet.
Soooo Bloodhound from Apex Legends could be Doomguy
A theory about tabs cave and more 1=üëç one theory
you forgot just cause because of square enix
and just cause has a butt ton of easter eggs
Mario is the Kevin Bacon of gaming lol
14:03 did he just call remy ratatouille?
Rayman could probably be connected to considering the Mario and rabbids game and how the rabbids originated in the rayman universe
Can you do a vid on who would win in a fight, Darkside from DC or Thanos from marvel.
8:26 Ooh, don't forget UB Funkeys! They're are the really first ones since 2007. :)
Wreck-It Ralph breaks the internet, enough said. XD
I have an even better cross over; Mr. Beast hosting Meme Review
if one of the game didnt connected to this universe then that game will be poor
Could we get a Kingdom Hearts III theory??? I really would like that!!
I like how Monika is in the back of his channel just Monika forever and ever and. ever and ever
What about bendy and the ink machine or undertale?!?!?!
You misspelled ‚ÄúCrazy person rants about video game multiverses‚Äù in the title

Edit: also I LOVE MatPat don‚Äôt get me wrong and the episode was incredibly entertaining, he just REALLY went off the rails with this one
2:02
H-e DOUBLE HOCKEYSTICKS
a true Canadian
he says hell beasts but not hell
Doesn't Wreck-It Ralph explain all of this crossover stuff enough?
6 Degrees of Doomguy.  :-P
This seems like the made-up Game Theory that parody channels would make when mocking Game Theory.
Please connect 40k to Doom so we can finally have Captain Titus in Smash ultimate.
MatPat , I have a theory I was wondering about. In Animal Jam Play Wild , Jamaa is different biomes. I was thinking , where exactly is Jamaa on the World Globe?
3:40 Oh, I haven't played any of the Commander Keen games in years! The only ones I've played were the 1st (Invasion of the Vorticons) and 4th (Goodbye, Galaxy). I remember playing them for hours.
I'm surprised that I'm not the only one who know of the Commander Keen games; they're practically buried gems.
Matpat, if you a line in fnaf was featured and you met Mario on a livestream that means the you have technically crossed the two universes. Think about it
Let's see how long until Doom Guy breaks that rule at 13:34. Let's see how long Smash Ultimate will be safe from him.

And once Doom Guy enters Smash Bros, let's see how long he can be safe from Piranha Plant.
Forza Horizon 3 would be connected as well because the Quartz Regilla (The Car from FF15) is in Forza Horizon 3. Tweet this at MatPat üòÇ
OH MY GOD I WAS WATCHING THIS AND MY XBOX SUGGESTED WOLFENSTEIN AND DOOM
Forza horizon 3 has a final fantasy car it also has the warthhog from halo halo made a cameo in rocket league and bomberman rocket league has flags and accessories from games like dying light and shows like Rick and misty I could go on
DOOM Guy and Kratos stomping Nazi Templar into pulp. Make it happen, folks.
with the avengers in it that means you can add Finius and Ferb
I‚Äôm pretty sure a Final Fantasy character was in Tekken 7, which has a whole slew of crossover connected to it.
dude, your going to hell. why are you trying to connect things that are not actually connected. go home. YOUR DRUNK
Whats the intro song to this video? Its sounds awesome!
sounds like a game conspiracy.
Well, I mean, since Doom guy goes to hell which, in DOOM 2016 is established to be a universal hell for all worlds, he could always just find Purple guy and cut him up with a chainsaw... just sayin'
Doomslayer and Doomguy are two different people.
I love how you all are reading Slovian surenames, just love it
Needless to say doom can also be connected to Tamriel via Hell probably being connected to the Planes of Oblivion. Dooms pretty much confirmed as a multiverse.
For Honor had a crossover with Assassin's Creed earlier last year as well.
He doesn't include smash bros but does count all the sports games.
Haven't seen someone connect so many dots than when my mate became schizophrenic
Whos in season 9 üòÑ
dude I already can't wait until Sora goes into final fantasy worlds
Do a doom timeline theory
Matpat don‚Äôt you dare ruin Kingdom Hearts with Fortnite
And Tetris crosses over with PuyoPuyo.... And there's a Drum Rhythm game with Kirby, Dedede,... and Reimu from Touhou...




....GENSOKYO CONFIRMED FOR KHIV
"I know what men can do when they're angry."
You can tell someone‚Äôs a sweat in fortnite when their rocking Donald duck
Who is Doomguy's grandfather?
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
I want Doomguy to slay the Ender Dragon
I READ THE TITLE AND WAS LIKE,FORTNITE IS CONNECTED!
Shrek doing the default in fortnite best meme ever
To quote Rolf from Ed Edd n Eddy, ‚ÄúYou crazy‚Äù.
3:35
Crowd: Who‚Äôs that Pok√©mon?!
Me: It‚Äôs Edna Mode!
Crowd: It‚Äôs commander Keen!
Me: FUUUUUUUUUU!!!!
Doom guy can't even mess with ice king
there is a disney game trilogy for the ds and the wii  called "Spectrobes". where would that fit in since its never mentioned in any of the other main nintendo games or disney related games. at least not that ive seen but i could be wrong about that since i cant afford to go about buying every disney and nintendo related game just to make sure that a ds and wii trilogy from 2007-2009 is ever mentioned. also neveer played doom and haven't seen infinity war yet but thanks for the fun little theory, guys.
It‚Äôs season 8 
If time was running out in season 5 what is it now ?
Hey MatPat, do a theory on which is the strongest Angry bird! Thanks!
...Did Matpat just try weed for the first time in his life?
mat i have a question:can u explane why botw isnt in any timeline?parralel timeline?
Screw thanos green doom guy is gonna beat him up
in the older verison their face looks simillair
oh god this is sans is nest again
Ok this is going WAY to far mat
Um Matpat you forgotten the MvsC series witch makes the crossover HUGE especially Resident Evil,Ace Attorney,Megaman and Megaman X also Dead Rising,Street fighter,and since Street Fighter √ó Tekken was a thing and then Tekken had a Walking Dead Character and final fantasy Character's and I can go on but you get the point

But that's just my theory
Mat...love you dude but WHAT?
Should definitely have a game where he warps into each and every mentioned universe.
One word "platipus"
When you need those clicks so you make a theory so you can use ALL OF THE TAGS
I know you just made this for more of a fun theory, but theories that are built about pure easter eggs and cameos are a real stretch and not enjoyable to watch honestly.
If u didn't do one on ghost recon wildlands u have not done ALL the ubisoft games
there has been a little crossover between infinity and kingdom hearts
Also to fit in with Kingdom Hearts. In Kingdom Hearts 3 Ralph from Wreck it Ralph appears  in-game. Which obviously connects with Ralph breaks the internet, which has the whole internet which connects not only all online connected game but the whole internet itself. Also the whole arcade has arcade games which would connect it to those. Short story it's literally all connected.
"Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover event in history"
MatPat: takes their diet coke, drinks it, gets a refill and makes them hold it
Kingdom Hearts already gave us Plot Twist within Plot Twist, we don't need a Crossover within Crossover.
So many crossovers I got comfused :}
Tell me doom guy can go to the dark soul universe 90 percent of the things there look like there from hell anyway
Too bad you did find away to cross Devil May Cry universe of the Mortal Kombat Universe, especially with Kronika doing her thing(which I will keep purposely vague due too spoilers.)
Wow... Only Canon huh.

You know like hidden characters in Tony Hawk.
Remember that time where Pikachu and Spongebob where in Silent Hill?...
But imagine it even with Smash Bros! Capcom is NOT safe.
how about no fortnite? I don't enjoy this game since season 1
assassins creed cant be shared with far cry because they dont have the same people that came before.
there is a fan theory I believe in that states that the world was destroid in blood dragon and then restarted to devalop into the world of far cry.
it explains why you can find a skeleton of a blood dragon in primal.
but in assassins creed there are also a race that came before humans and they are nothing like the cyber commandos.
so though you can find a abstergo sign in far cry 3.
you can eather believe in an assassins creed crossover or a blood dragon crossover.
not both.
Shrek vs Thanos despacito battle is canon now
Okay the KH3 link was like crack theory stuff, but dang it works
Boi this is ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù
Sonic and kingdom hearts crossover
Technically wouldn‚Äôt every universe be connected because Monsters Inc. just have a door that connects to it?
So you've discovered the "Oasis" from "Ready Player One" go ahead and invent it so we can all enjoy.
We're you looking for MrBeast commentaries?
I feel like people are getting ruder to matpat
JUST LOOK AT TYE COMMENTS ;(
This is all Tony Hawks fault
wtf








and.......






somehow i want this to connect to undrtale








you know why
Legit thought the commander keen shadow was Edna from the incredibles
But isn't William Afton in hell right nowü§îü§îü§îü§îüëåüëåü§£
Peach is dead in your Rosalina theory and she is either in heaven or hell,hell is where Cassidy is torturing purple guy/willam afton
If all the video games are connected, then...




 I want Kass and his children + the Squid Sisters IMMEDIATELY!
This would be a good episode for April 1.
Craziest theory since you thought Sans was Ness
if sans is Ness well undertale is in this too
HELL YEAH!! DOOM !!!!!!!
i... prefer the old intro
Do a game theory on why it's never morning in the Arkham series
What fresh hell have you awoken this time, Mattew Patrick...?
best. intro. ever.
Ok this is a cross over episode
final fantasy 15 had gordon freeman in it on pc/steam so that opens up the half life and portal universe
Who remembers Kingdom of Hearts on the DS
Honestly I‚Äôm kinda surprised HALO isn‚Äôt somehow connected
Unibrow matpat vs doom guy
Theory: ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!!!!!!
Wait drift is from real life........ PLOT TWIST
First few seconds I‚Äôm
like: Matt are you getting enough sleep?
Hey Matpat! I just went to Stop and Shop and when I was walking out I saw a. Old lady on  motorized  Cart with over 20 Diet Coke Party sized bottles in it. It reminded me of you :)
14:50
Epic
Mat‚Äôs officially cracked
You didn't say this, and i don't know if this was said before, but that would also link both Monster Hunter, and Witcher if you count the behemoth going to MH:W, and Geralt of Rivia also going to MH:W (Monster Hunter: World)
Violets are violet, matpats on drugs, violets aren‚Äôt blue, Diet Coke is enough

EDIT-Also, just checked days later... whoever the hell liked this is a reasonable man. Or woman.
This is now my favorite episode
Sees Disney Infinity cutscene, nostalgia takes over
People are roasting you in the comments but I'm genuinely entertained by this lmao MatPat you really are something. This video is just filled with chaotic goodness and I"m here for it.
I love it holy mother of pearl this is so cool.
Woah
Kingdom hearts is a crossover. Now it's a crossover with fortnite apparently. Two crosses make an X. Which means fortnite started organisation 13!
did april fools come early?
might as well say games scenarios exist in other far infinite dimensions parallel universe
U forgot EA, blizzard, Activision and valve
I want doom to be the season 8 secret skin
This video might be a good spot to find some ingredients
Koff
Koff
Undertale and reddit
Koff
Koff



What?
Do a theory on if the phantom ruby from Sonic Forces is possible I really want to know and it will give you a chance to appease the Sonic fans.
That intro tho lol
We already know that everything in Nintendo is connected (super smash bros)
it's not April yet, is it?
HALF LIFE 3, CONFIRMED. Our Lord and Saviour Gaben, will now make all the trip a's come together, and make HL3-the omniverse.
3:37 I thought it was Edna from incredibles
Half the things you mentioned aren‚Äôt anywhere near canon lol
Tbh this isn't that impressive when you realize that Kevin Bacon theory exist
Actually Doomguy is confirmed to have fought the forces of hell for, and I quote ‚Äòeons‚Äô of years, aka billions of years.
I legit thought it was Edna mode
Make a part 2!
Totally thought Billy Blaze his silhouette was Edna Mode
Doom Slayer confirmed for Smash.
With this theory we can get Doomguy vs Kratos
Does that mean mafia city is connected to smash bros? LEVEL 1000 BOSS AS A FIGHTER
Please do a DEVOTION theory!
I used to play wolfstien-3D when i was younger....i am currently 14 years old and yes i have a time machine at my house
i thought the thumbnail said one word: "sharded"
If you think matpat is drunk, say aye
You should take a break MatPat
doomguy is the most badass man to ever badass in the history of badassery
I bet you would just want Doomguy to be in FNAF so you can get revenge for when you tried to solve the timeline of FNAF. But seriously my mind is blown.
When I first read the title I thought to myself how can Okami be related all to fortnite?
>says this will be in canon
>connects Disney infinity to fortnite

Go home your drunk
This episode feels very lazy theory-wise. No stars.
READY PLAYER TWO COMFIRMED
Uh oh
It‚Äôs h e double double chopsticks
How was the Wreck it Ralph movie never mentioned?  It basically implied that all video game universes were connected.
Imagine if there was a game you are doom guy and travell to all These universes and cause chaos. 10/10 would buy game again.
Darth Vader fights in soul caliber and infinity
OK I BELIEVE YOU
Someone het Scott to include a Easter egg of doomsayer tearing purple guy limb form limb.
wait if doom man is connected to final fantasy is he connected to yo kai watch
Friendly reminder that the events in Kingdom Hearts 3 are canon in the Toy Story universe
He double hockey sticks




Bootiful
the only connection I see with FNAF is in Deltaruin where near the end of the game if you talk to Burgerpants one of the things he mentions is about a Purple Guy who he doesn't believe he works here
so if we can find away to crossover Undertale/Deltaruin we can say FNAF is connected
At 4:20 they correct the generations to claim that Keen was BJ's grandson, but the numbers don't line up. If Doom Guy is BJ Blazkowicz III, he's the grandson of BJ Blazkowicz I. You don't do the numbered naming thing if you're naming your son after his grandfather.
ah yes, how doom guy can go from game to game and kill everyone, the best theory
"...the most popular game"
*shows Fortnite*

*Apex Legends cries*
you can put angry birds cuz sonic dash event
I think you missed another crossover point with Disney where it intersects many games and even real social mediate companies, Wreck It Ralph and its sequel.
and what does this have to do with Doom guy
wow wow WOW Now my mind is exploding
14:04 his name is not ratatouille its REMY
Do a theory about Ghost from Antman and wasp
I can't tell if this is a troll theory or not XD
Says he isn't going to include non-canon cameo games like Smash Bros.  Immediately includes non-canon cameos in games like Tony Hawk.

Just because there's a Darth Vader unlock in some random video game that got included for the memez doesn't mean that it's canon.  Nobody's standing around on the Death Star going "Hey remember that one time Lord Vader went to 20th century Earth and played skateboards?"
I thought the shadowy figure at 3:35 was Edna Mode from the incredibles...üòê
I am in the year 2137 T-series has taken over I‚Äôm currently living inside a burrito
Did you notice the editor buttons on the thumbnail
10:55 it‚Äôs definitely glorious
1 month later - FNAF 7 confirmed
Any Doom guy to be seen?
Well, at least slime rancher is untouched by fortnite.
Master Chief (Worried): Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
I have another link. 

In the Tony Hawk Pro Skater link, let‚Äôs look at an old comic from 1996, which had a brief crossover of Marvel and DC. This adds DC into the mix. 

Now look at Image Comics. They had a character named Angela in the Spawn universe. I don‚Äôt follow it, but I like to connect as many things as possible, so I took interest in this character. You see, Angela was made by Neil Gaiman, who went to court for rights for her against Image and won. He then continued to sell the rights to Angela to Marvel, who proceeded to make Angela Thor‚Äôs sister. 

Now, through obscure comic history, you have canon links to both DC and Image games. Knock yourself out. I‚Äôm sure you can make the whole web of connections stretch farther.
Top 1 anime crossovers
14:30 oh hey I've seen that meme before
Love your Mr beast plug
amazing bro
since cloud is in super smash bros and that means that we could get Donald Duck get into smash
This theory is almost as crazy as when Matpat said Sans is Ness
I can't think of anything other than doom guy ripping ganon in half now
So, at the start of the video, you said that things like smash don't count. But then you go on to say that doomguy's connected to everything through unlockable characters in Tony hawk's pro skater? This seems less like a theory, and more like a list of references that games make to each other.
this sounds like a bad fanfiction
THE OMEGA INTRO
14:27 that's right I'm sick and tired of purple guy and his kill count it's about time doom guy makes one more crossover and give Will Afton what's coming to him once and for all
I think the matpat  is making the Tommy westphall universe theory on the film theory
Mickey Mouse confirmed to be the next doom guy



Jesus Christ...why do I even bother (to try and figure out what sort of sorcery exists here in this channel)?
Connecting this theory to Final Fantasy and Kindom Hearts will make this theory 100000000000 times more complicated
Uh there is also my icon hmmm I mean monster hunter from ff14
what about skyrim and rainbow six seige
When fortnite crosses over with minecraft and no DOOM
Actually I like the 14:55
"The MatPatta verse" much more than the other ones
Well if you're going to use (apparently canonical) Basketball games and Movies, dumping NBA Jam:TE into the mix adds in a connection to Space Jam, so now you have the whole Loony Tunes universe to play with which is more soild than Final Fantasy XV theories.
NBA Jam:TE also brings in The Fresh Prince which puts into the NBC Network cross-overs, which puts you into the Saint Elsewhere connection theory. So, yeah, using basketball games connects everything to everything and I did it in fewer steps.
THA MUTHAFUCKIN' DOOMGUY!
hey mat pat i'm thinking of making ultimate custom night 2 with scott cawthon and it has sonic bendy heck it even has baldi one game that you did,nt make a gane theory on yet.
I just noctic first and jarred are Freddy and boinne
What about Cloud's appearance in the original Kingdom Hearts? COME ON MATPAT!
I think only nintendo share the universe with Sega. Because we all know that sonic was in one of the famous nintendo game. And its super smash bros
Prepare to be overwhelmed. 
Elements from Gravity Falls (also Phineas and Ferb, which connects it to Milo Murphy‚Äôs Law) are included in Disney Infinity, therefore is included in this universe. Through Future-Worm!‚Äôs season finale, Gravity Falls is connected to many other Disney XD shows, the only one I remember being Wander Over Yonder, but there were about four or five more. Gravity Falls also has its connections to the portals in Rick And Morty, which only leads to craziness. 

Try to imagine one of these characters in KH! Wow!
City of insomnia. Wait, no one can sleep in this city?
1:36 cherry coke is better
What if it happened. buys the crossover game
I‚Äôve seen rubber bands stretch less than this
Wait... but what about persona 5??
The hellbeasts of doom vs the Eldritch Abominations of Kirby
If someone could animate doomguy systematically going through each of these games and murdering everything, I would pay you my soul
May I mention that since Kingdom Hearts is part of this, that means Wreck-It-Ralph is included in this as well. That means the massive world connecting the video games is open, and now the whole internet is too. 

Since the internet is open, YouTube is as well. Which means he can beat T series for Pewdiepie, beat you up, and... yeah.

Pretty big deal. Also, Shrek memes are a part of this.
You‚Äôre forgetting one game,Metal Gear Solid 4.
Solid snake wore a Assassin‚Äôs Creed outfit in some instances of the game.
Which means,Snake Is Also hopping over to Bomb people along with Big Boss,Although,Konami probably wouldn‚Äôt agree.
BoJack Horseman reference? Instant thumbs up
matpat can jump higher than shaggy
Summoing up this video, everything is basically connected and crossovers can happen canonnically. doom guy driving the battle bus with pikachu and sonic can't wait
This show has been helping me with losing my dog and I just want to say thank you matpat you really help
And splinter cell has a reffrence to mgs in "some guy in a bandana" so yea
#Notification squad
You should do a YouTube channels crossover theory.
I think your stretching with those DLC and BONUS CHARACTERS matpat
Taking "Stretching" to a whole new level
I really hope your wrong about aaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllll of this  matpat
Since final fantasy now links to the kingdom hearts universe, this means everything is now connected to super smash bros and thus, pretty much every nintendo game AND all the 3rd party character‚Äôs universes.  You also linked to ubisoft later which also links back round to mario with mario+ rabbids
Scoot Coffens new Game: Five nights at dooms 
      you play as droom guy and try to kill purple guy
Sans is Ness 2: Electric Boogaloo
RIP Matpat 


Didn't get to play in sr. beast's 100 battle royal


can we get some f's in the chat?
IS UNDERTALE A JOKE TO YOU!!!!
What about the skyrim reference in hell?
You Should Do A Warframe Theory
Again for everyone, even matpat, the movie is called Ratatouille, the actual rat is named Remy

Edit: no hate to matpat or anything cause he‚Äôs awesome. But yeah it‚Äôs Remy
You just single handed destroyed the universe
My Doom clone was Duke Nukem 3D :D
Also, Shrek exists in modern canon? Makes sense given Far Far Away's modern style which includes actual cameras.
10:41 This means Ranger X has been unleashed. And his 400 damage potions are coming for you.
Not three decades, four ages, In doom 2016 the following is said: ''In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.'' The game takes place in the fourth age.
The only reason I clicked was because doom was in the title
I really hope this is a joke
You don't have to heal sora if he's already dead
You mentioned cloud in there and cloud is in smash bros which means doom guy could enter metal gear sonic mario zelda kirby metroid pac-man wii fit and countless other game series's. Eh?
All games shared a universe, or rather, multiverse ever since Half-Life's Resonance Cascade
uhhhh sorry Matt but this is a new low point
what have you done?
Monster hunter world also had a cross over with final fantasy lately
I love just being blown out of my mind and then coming back just to be blown out again
what about Overwatch, Starcraft, and PETA
Or Sora going get in Smash
I mean its technically how tony hawks pro skater connects all games
YEEEEEEESSS! DOOOM !
You gotta do a Skylanders theory!!!
Cool story, bro. 
Needs more No Man's Sky and Ratchet & Clank.
Fun fact, final fantasy made a crossover with final fantasy, with it starring behemoth, and final fantasy having rathalos. So that's one extra universe. Furthermore, then there was the witcher crossover with monster hunter. Meaning, we can have doom guy hunting dragons and wyverns alike.  Just something i noticed.
Still not better than the Tetris 99 x Kingdom Hearts crossover
DOOMGUY: DEMONS !!!!!!!!
GOBLIN SLAYER: GOBLINS !!!!!!
For all of those were saying that matpat is making huge logical leaves based on non-canon appearances in his first ever crossover episode he said that if characters are physically present it‚Äôs undeniable so checkmate naysayers
I can't not like this theory XD
Theres a theory that in the recent Marvel movie Captain Marvel theres is a certain item that links the marvel universe to Pulp Fiction so if the game theory holds up Doom can show up in Pulp Fiction?
MatPat... Too Much Diet Coke? I Can See It By The Last 3 Videos
Literally the best game theorists video ever
Mario's best friend is john wick
Ah!..OF COURSE IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF THE WAS AN ACTUAL GAME OUT THERE WITH every GAME!!!!!
matpat we need a final fantasy theory
Oh and also MatPat, Spiderman had a crossover with Transformers in the comics so technically Doom is also part of the same universe as Optimus Prime :D
Animal crossing and Zelda oh also splatoon so doom guy can ink it up with the squid kids
Also monster hunter world had a final fantasy crossover so that means the doom slayer can fight anything in that game aswell and metal gear peace walker had a crossover with monster hunter as well as the witcher
Also The halo universe isnt connected or is it?
I'm soooooo confused
So Smash isn't canon, but a PC exclusive character allusion IS? uHUuuuuuH
Clearly it‚Äôs the Cosmere that‚Äôs the most ambitious crossover. Book theory!
MatPat...

I'm genuinely worried now.  Are you eating right?  Sleeping well?  Doing any illicit drugs?  How's your love life - wait, no, don't answer that one, we probably don't need to know.

Seriously bro, you seem to be working way too hard here.  I know a good shrink...  But I also know a lovely beach resort with free mini-bars that's way cheaper.  Give it some thought, get back to me.  In the meantime, no more videos for at least, like, a week!  Seriously, take a damn break before you blow a fuse, bro!  This is getting scary.
Wait......I thought Afton already got what he deserved. He's in eternal hell and death
the botw game has a xenoblade chronicles 2 sidequest so thats also connected
This video and the Sans is Ness video have the same energy
Basically ,all video games are somehow linked
Nice to see waybackmachine get a shoutout
MatPat, you missed Monster Hunter when you were talking about Square-Enix. Behemoth and Moogle both are featured in Monster Hunter World. Even Geralt from the Witcher franchise was seen in the world of Monster Hunter. All three characters showed up via some kind of portal. Now imagine a Doom crossover in Monster Hunter World (Iceborne).
That was one hell of a ride o_O
All companies: am i a joke to you
Do video on doom guy
HEY!!! Coca Cola give this poor man a Diet Coke sponsorship
Make a video on OFF please :3
Don't mention Donald constantly  dying I hate him soo much for it
Don't forget, Monster Hunter World has the Behemoth from Final Fantasy XV, and all the monster hunter worlds are all connected, which means any and every crossover in Monster Hunter games is connected, including Hello Kitty, Metal Gear, Lost Planet, Dead Rising, Inuyasha, Darkstalkers, Attack on Titan, Asura's Wrath, Dragon's Dogma, Fate/Stay Night, Onimusha, Sengoku Basara, Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, Fire Emblem, One Piece, Madoka Magica, Sonic, Megaman, Animal Crossing, Breath of Fire 6, Resident Evil, Strider, Okami, Evangelion, Ghosts n Goblins, Neir:Automata, Sailor Moon, Horizon Zero Dawn, Fairy Tail, Phantasy Star, and most recently The Witcher. I'm sure that within those games are more and more crossovers as well.
Hey everyone REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Does not even mention Wreck It Ralph after link with disney
Teacup mechanic hitter was that in your script
Ok MatPat, season 8 just launch and we need answer, the discord and reddit failed and now we need your help to solve it, launch an another video, recap or some sort of stuff to get the community back to it, please
most ambitious cross over
so does anyone else remember that time that Garfield appeared on ninja turtles
yeah no answer as expected
Matthew Patrick my brain hurts dude this channel has done so much to me
How is FNaF the ONLY ONE not in it 
also whos your dealer matpat
FYI it is 2137 and we‚Äôre watching this in history class
youre drunk early this cant amount to toys in a box but disney infiniry
"Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover event in history"
MatPat: "gaming"
That's 15 minutes wasted
All worlds are connected. One Sky. One Destiny, after all.
Hey is just me or he never did a little nightmare episode or he probably did and I didn‚Äôt find it
2319!
WE GOT A 2319!!!!!
To anyone watching in 2137, TheGameTheorists were being rhetorical when they gave you a shout out. That being said, if you are actually are watching this in 2137, I have to ask you: did EA ever stop being a bad company, is it still existent?
I like the bojack horseman reference
With the Mario series being connected, this connects to the WarioWare series, which in turn connects to the Game and Watch series.
What if every game(except FNAF) had crossover game, I'd call it " the unearthly final battle"
Were the undertale
That intro tho
Dead space is also in tony hawk
MASS EFFECT PART 2 WHERE IS IT?
So basically it‚Äôs just doom guy destroying everything
Wouldn‚Äôt the Doomguy think that demons were controlling the suits in FNaF?
ahhahah i ama get httyd in this universe
Overwatch?
If you accept any crossover as Canon, all things are Canon.
and it all connects DDLC
I hope your happy knowing that just reading the title gave me a seizure...
Have you seen the new fnaf 8 trailer yet because I can't wait for you too restart fnaf theory again üòÅ‚úåÔ∏è
oh god mat pat has officially spent too much time in his closet and is crazy EVERYONE RUN NEXT HES GONNA MAKE A CROSSOVER BETWEEN ALL GAMES AND ALL MOVIES!


too late.
This Is the pinnacle of stupidity.
Matpat, How Fast can Steve from Minecraft actually run?
Now that's A LOT of CROSS-OVERS!!!üòÜ
and the final fantasy connection means that doom guy could cross over to yo-kai watch, then to taiko no tatsujin, then to puzzle & dragons as well as the mario universe, which means he could go to the world of kirby and the world of zelda......
Dope intro
Tony Hawks potater 1 2 and 3
14:09 Robotnik is a nazi sympathizer
I mean... it's not really crossover and more like... refferences
Don't forget the chocobo in yokai watch 3 that allows you to get chocobonyan
I can see sora hanging with assassin creed trilogy would be awesome for sora to have an assassin outfit.
Lazarbeam will be in that video in mr beast he says in his latest video
BFG 9000 IN FORTNITE
So it‚Äôs all connected because the tony hawk game decided to add characters from other games seriously
He didn't mentioned elder scrolls series
wait, so you saying that disney universe is connected with the just cause universe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wait, so you saying that disney universe is connected with the just cause universe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The most ambitious crossover is super and super villain bowl
Where‚Äôs Pok√©mon?????????



Matthew this is crucial you forgot Pok√©mon Eevee is sad now
Well.... You can also connect Megaman and Devil May Cry as well. There was a Sonic the Hedgehog/Megaman crossover in the comics by Archie Comics (unfortunately I don't know if there is a video game crossover you can reference here, but let's just go with it for a sec...), Megaman and Dante from Devil May Cry stared in a game together. Which one you ask? Project X Zone. This also adds other games as well including dotHack, Resident Evil, Tekken, and even Dead Rising.
Sonic crossed over with angry birds
Matt looks like a kid trying to connect all games he like into a world
oh snap matpat, fnaf 8 is coming!
I can't wait for people to get incredibly mad at this.
mat pat can u make a game pls
mat pat if u inclod disney you get ralph breaks the internet witch means you can littarly get to every video game ever
Purple guy would kill Doom guy. Wait...THE GUY-VERSE!
Overwatch wouldn‚Äôt be in that
Don‚Äôt forget Animal Crossing and Splatoon bc they‚Äôre in Mario kart 8 deluxe.
2:40 "Woofenstein"
Hey matpat, I've been watching for a few years now and I am growing concerned about your mental state. I don't think all these diet cokes are doing you any favors. Please drink some water to flush all those chemicals out of your system.
MATT PATT MENTIONED FINAL FANTASY IM DYING YAY
Sooooooo....basically every video game in existence is connected...is that about right?
Someone in the comments should totally find that one connection to FNAF that he missed so he has to make a whole new video on it.
Lol the Mr. Beast reference
I think you gone too far
Mat pat the future is really cool you should build a time machine and vist see your children‚Äôs children do the same thing game theorists
Eyyy this is bit of a stretch nay?
Normal person : infinity war was the biggest crossover ev-
MatPat : hahahahahaAHAHAHAHA
I WANT THIS TO BE AN ACTUAL GAME AND THEN WE THROW FNAF IN
Also Halo isn't in this universe.  Not just fnaf.
what about monster hunter?
Is it me or would wrench and doom guy get along well
I dont like fortnite and it is dying...

Change my mind
This is really crazy!
Isn‚Äôt there a theory that Link is Doom Guy?
thump Challenge... accepted.
I think MatPat is Hallucinating.
If the marvel universe is part of it, then you could add marvel vs Capcom. Adding every single Capcom character including street fighter which will bring in mortal kombat which brings multiple horror movies and action movies(Freddie Kruger, Leatherface, alien, predator), then brings in injustice and injustice 2 through netherealm, which because of the multiverse system, gives the whole dc universe. netherealm also made a WWE game giving us wrestling. Punch-Out has Mike Tyson which was a boxer giving us Mayweather who played in the UFC giving us all ea games. Back to the superheroes, they each have respective lego games, giving us all lego games(Disney also has one). Now we have franchises like Jurassic Park, star wars, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. Literally, almost every game in existence is connected through a multiverse. We can finally see Thanos in a battle with Ryu while The rock beats up goofy in the background.
what about minecraft
1:40 everyone is talking about thisüòÇ
What about undertale
Now there is a doom VR
Only Tony Hawk is gnarly enough to defeat Thanos
You had me until Fortnite.
Twenty-three Nineteen means 'W S':- White Sock.
Y‚Äôknow... um... most characters in random games AREN‚ÄôT cannon, like Mario basketball, or that skating boarding game.
If only god of war was connected
I admit, organization 13 and the Templars working together does sound like an awesome plot. üòç
what about halo? or warframe? or prototype?
Monster Hunter world features a crossover with ffIV, I want to watch doom guy obliterate a Rathalos. Not to mention the Witcher 3 crossover.
I don't know about this one chief...
Wait, since Doom happens in hell, which Micheal Afton now resides in, doesn‚Äôt that mean that the FNAF universe is connected too?
What kinda wacky tabacky have you guys been smoking?!
Make lbp theories!!!
Now Doom is connected to persona 5
Thier is a mario refens in fnaf so soon guy can beat up purple guy
you forgot yo kai watch
Of course doom has to unite everything because it‚Äôs awesome
Where does Just Shapes & Beats fit in?
This is a good no-thinky theory.
IS THAT A 23-19?
Well Doom fights in he tooth picks and purple guy is in he tooth picks so Doom can beat up purple guy
I don‚Äôt even know what the hell is going on what were you thinking when writing this
And if u think about it, with the spider-verse connected it connects the marvel-dc crossover universe so dc is apart of this now and then it can all lead to other things, and there's the marvel transformers crossover universe, And cause that exists therefore the Ghostbusters is connected due to all that due to that crossover which therefore connects all of Gi Joe and other Hasbro propertys to this multiverse, and this logic can apply to all other enterprises so eventually probably every single enterprise can be connected to each other, I can't wait for Doom Guy to start rampaging on the little  ponies
Hey matpat I had been working on a similar theory using your previous videos and focusing on mapping the connected verse (I called it the ultra verse),  but I started off with marvel and Dc since they have a lot of crossovers with different things. and sorry I barely saw your theory I‚Äôve been really busy.
but it did blow my mind
If i could describe this video in one word it would be ‚ÄúCRIKEY‚Äù
sees thumb nail
alright mat, this time YOUVE GONE TO FAR!!!
Im pretty sure Disney Infinity counts as canon about as much as Smash Brothers but I digress
Good beer > Diet Coke.  Change my mind.  I dare you!
That opening.
I yust hope i ken be the doom Guy or a fortnite character beating up the robots
When I wanted a KH theory this was the literal last thing I asked...
Mattpat





MY DIET COKE LOVING MAN
I think Matpat has finally lost it
You lost a like Matpat
Right so he's lost it.
it's even bigger than you think now it's since you're connected to your first video now it's connected to YouTube since you connected YouTube is basically connected to everything ever
Wait a minute...in the latest Henry Stickman game you can find Freddy Fazbear in a dark room. In earlier games in the series, you can use items such as Kirby‚Äôs warp star, and use Boos. Therefore, Mario is connected to FNAF and then connected to Doom. DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN
Doom guy is doom guy no matter how many bullets or traps or anything doom guy is going to kill all the fortnit players no matter what
The Disney infinity part my nastogla meter went so far
MatPat find a way to fit fnaf  There probably is someway to fit it


btw you missed pokemon
game developers and publishers: marketing deals and fun collaborations
matpat: EPIC SHARED UNIVERSE THEORY!!!
So this is basically Crossover
Awwww oh how I miss Disney infinity. Who else used to play it?
Lesson here: Dont let Doom Guy out of his game.
Alice angle joining organization 13
I laughed way more than I really should have during this video
And Undertale and Deltarune too are missing and Minecraft
And bendy
then sans appeared out of nowhere.....
That blown my mind
Mr. Mat Pat, Will you particpate on Mr Beast airsoft battle royale?
I actually enjoyed the vid though, you guys need to take your negativity someplace else.
The teen mat pat shall be named, "matchne"!!!!!
yes, please give me a doom game where i can gun down disney characters
This was insane and hilarious.
I don't know if its just a coincedence but at 6:08 when you read the editor note on the top of the screen, its written you may watch the video in 2137... this year refers to 21 : 37 which is the exact hour and minute of John Paul II's death, which is widely a joke in Poland
6:25 excuse me wtf? wa the hell?, wen? how? wtf again?
S-s-sans?!?!?!?!?!?!
Umm wouldn't this be a wreak it Ralph since wreak it Ralph did have almost all retro video games in it that every video game is just one big great universe not only that but make our universe and the video game universe as one?
14:06 omg so true
So you're saying EVERY single game (except fnaf) is connected
final fantasy and teken 7 are linked
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO not....fnafüò≠
The only time the introduction is different.
looks like doomguy just stopped every bad guy ever
>Title and thumbnail about fortnite and kingdom hearts
>spends most of video talking about doom guy and briefly mentions both the title franchises

I'm sorry but while the title is technically true it does not represent the actual content of the video. It just looks exactly like you are desperate to use marketable games in the title for views. YouTube is a harder game then it used to be but you don't need to stoop to click bait

Edit: I believe the title and thumbnail was changed to be more representative of the content in the video. Thanks for listening to feedback and making an appropriate change
So that means Capcom in there too Capcom vs marvel.
Think-doom marine in metroid.          *music intensifies to air shattering levels *
Tony Hawk.. really.......
"Ahem" I know this may sound a bit crazy, or that it doesn't make sense, but what about a couple of games that were big, or popular, not too long ago? Actually just last year, at least one of them became huge for a short bit. I'm talking about Subnautica, and Ark Survival Evolved.
looks at title
Is this what you wanted?
3:37. Could have sworn that was the lady from the incredibles who makes the suits lmao
Don't worry guys Mat just drank too much diet coke for this theory.
I like to see if the Game Theorists can crack a game that has been been on my mind for a few months.  Has anyone remembered the .hack//Games and the bosses known as the 8 Epitaths of Twilight?  I like to know their meaning, what big role they play, the meaning behind their names and what significance do they all play!
this was just the gaming version of the bacon number...
GUYS WERE NOT GONNA USE NON CANON GAMES, but TONY HAWK SCATER 2
Wait wait wait I need to take a Breath
Matpat, the doom guy was in drtc so the zombo apocalypse is canon in all these franchises.
I want to see a theory on Payday 2
Just dance in final fantasy confirmed
Fun challenge: take a shot every time Matt says cross
make bojack theory on film theory!
I wanna see doom guy taer Eden's Gate apart
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Wait this means mario nintendo in minecraft the world and skin pack are conected with halo and adventure time too
Average person: infinity war is the biggest crossover ever

Matpat: Hold my diet coke
Tbh matpat if doom did go to fnaf he would beat the ever living fluff out if the amintronics then possibly purple guy if he sees him
but  wolfestien guy has 2 twins  ...girls
I might actually try to see if there are any other connections here, because some sort of truly ultimate crossover story would be really cool.
I have not play it in weeks
In Kingdom Hearts Battle Royale, 100 people fight to win the grand prize, an explanation of the story
Pikmin fnaf animal crossing pacman wii fit pokemon star fox and kid icarus not included
Halo?
6:41 James charles? ‚Äúanyway‚Äù
I'm so excited to see Crono and gang take on the legions of hell.
Ok matpat
Can you PLEASE stop craming random memes into your videos-

MatPat: inaudible screeching
Lol what about forza horizon with the final fantasy car being in there? (Horizon 3 and 4) and that'll be funny if Halo was part of this too and call of duty and so on üòÇ
2319!!!!
I was with you until you got to tony hawk and Shrek.
0:24 did you see the sign behind game theory
literally came  to  the video because I wanted to see if fnaf was related
can you do another theory on hello neighbor using the new books that came out and also hide and seek
You have gone insane!!! Take a chill pill!!!
good start, but here's the natural extension: we know mario is in this connected universe, and that means donkey and diddy kong are as well. diddy kong had his own spin off, diddy kong racing. this contained characters such as Banjo and Conker. Conker, in his own game Conker's bad fur day, fought a boss that was unmistakably a xenomorph.  due to alien vs predator, we know predator also exists in this universe. Thus, it is canonically possible to have a matchup between doomguy and the predator.
I feel someone is stretching it a bit
Hmm matpat isn't doing any fnaf theorys...lets fix that with a controlled shock
Now I need to play Undertale over and over until I can make Undertale become part of this universe.
Congrats, your the first person to make $10,000 off of Kevin Bacon. Love u Mat Pat. No Homo
3:35 = Edna mode from incredibles 1 and 2
EVERY GAME CREATOR NEEDS TO SEE THIS
People:Infinity war is the most ambitious crossover ever




God:platypus





Edit:what about halo 
I WANT TO SEE MASTER CHEIF AND DOOM GUY BATTLE/WORK TOGETHER
I my god you watch Mr beast
And then we found the end of infinity.
Wait...
Where is undertale in this video?
I actually want a full doom theory video.
This is ridiculous.  I love it.
What if theres a universe out there that has life just like ours but full of game planets instead?
3:36 Edna
my brain hurts
You are forgetting that monster hunter made a crossover with final fantasy
This is fabulous
And yo kai  watch
Matpat your brain is your greatest weapon and it scares me.
Did he write this in a shower?
I think Doom Slayer would better fit in Apex Legends better than Fortnite
I love doom I have all of the games expet the third one
When he showed commander keen I thought it was Edna mode
My brain hurts
Next video : every video game character is dead
Sports cross overs are cheating
Um u forgot Roblox Minecraft the pvz series and others games
honestly, this is interesting to consider but I also have one problem with this.
1. even if doom guy wanted to get the highest K/D to ever exist, he wouldn't try to go after these different people because doom guy only goes after demons, so at most he would probably go to the god of war universe, and that's even going a little too far because cratos is a god and not a demon
It's 3031, futures the same.

DAMMIT. I wish there was a FNAF crossover.
Umm.... Mat.... I think you need some sleep
And you know who else appears in the MCU? That's right, Elon Musk, who recently appeared in Meme Review. That's right, PewDiePie is canon to the MCU, and by extension, to Doom and Fortnite.

Hi Matt,


I am big fan of you and I wish you would make a video on the current Poodeepee v/s T Series. I expect that you would notice that while you and other Youtubers are making relevant content and not just reviewing memes but researching and analyzing millions of things to make a video, someone else is continuously gaining subscribers not by making good content, but by begging for subscribers and it is rather shameful and demotivating that other top Youtubers are supporting this unnecessary competition and please also take up on the issue of RACISM behind this situation and the RACIST face of that top Youtuber. I really have high hopes from you Matt. Only if the top Youtubers would have given competition to T Series by coming together to make even more awesome and intellectual content, this situation would have been truly won by content creators even if the numbers did not support them. Remember ROCKY, it's not the numbers that count and not the award a win is when you are people's winner. You are the only one who can take a brave stand on this situation and present honest unbiased and practical review of the current situation.
Matpat needs to visit a doctor, he's not mentally stable
BARNEY MEETS ELMO AND BARRY B. BENSON.
I agree with you MatPat
Forgot the FF/Monster Hunter crossover :P
Disney Infinity is my favorite game!!!!!
This is honestly just a contrived way of saying that Sans is Ness...
Don‚Äôt worry mat you still cringe
Yaaaaay doom guy!
hey dis meet mie tink waay not de game theorits game
Matt. Enough is Enough
This confirms that Doomguy is for smash DLC
Mat  gone off the deep end and down the rabbit hole
I love Disney infinity so much
Where does Hollow Knight fit in?
This was just an excuse to make Doom Guy assault as much people as possible.
This theory is like saying that movies and actors connected by the Six Degrees of Bacon are canonically within the same universe.
Wot..
I loved infinity
What would happen if fortnite was real life
Are you ok?
Sora is ness confirmed
Did you know that the Toy Box world in Kingdom Hearts is cannon to the actual Toy Story Universe? It takes place in between Toy Story 2 and 3. Let‚Äôs pray for some Kingdom Hearts Easter eggs in Toy Story 4!!!
This. Is. Epic.
3:35 the first thing that came to my head was keen star
Let‚Äôs just not
I can connect another game into this, Minecraft


Minecraft has a Super Mario skin pack and world in the bedrock versions of the game. If we count this as canon, There is nothing stopping the Doom Slayer ripping creepers to a bloody pulp.
AND Minecraft has a Halo skin pack, so that is  neat.
good job hitting 500 videos and 11 millon subs
This is so absurd holy
MattPat checkout the Rusty Lake game series, they are escape games for mobile devices but the story is really intricate and i'd love to have a definite timeline or something !
RIP AND TEAR
Ness is in super smash bros, so that means SANS UNDERTALE can join this theory
there are a lot more videogames that are not connected like warhammer 40k , remmeber me, dead space, lost planet, Bioshock, dark souls and if am right even resident evil and they re probably even more than this games that are not connected to this universe your talking about.
Lol  who is a final fantasy fan
I thought the commander kean silhouette was Edna Mode... it wasnt
Ready Player One anyone!
Your non-canonical rule should have ruled out the Tony Hawk game essentially rendering the entire second half of your video and most of the universes mentioned invalid. I usually like your videos but this one was pretty weak.
My head hurts
This is it
You forgot Halo
Getting a general vibe here that you think doom guy would be some sort of unstoppable force of destruction. But if literally every game is joined, especially other lesser known games from mentioned franchises, then I feel that characters like Rico Rodriguez would be the unstoppable ones, considering he can take a nuke to the face in jc3 and survive numerous strikes of lightning in jc4
Because there are mods in Minecraft where it adds things from other games, that means that almost every game in the world is linked through Minecraft
What about the infamous franchise, are they connected too?
What would doom guy some how be in metroid or metroid be in doom that a good game theory just think about it
You gotta find a crossover with red dead 2
villianously laughing
This was alright until you mention kingdom hearts, THAT was a stretch
You should look towards monster hunter you could spread it out a little further
Some comment lost in time
Well if doomguy DID come to fortnite, then he would be literally invincible. (he already is though) because only demons can penetrate the praetor suit, plus, "not even death can stop the doom slayer", as doom eternal says.
No. No Epic collab! You want DOOM to become an Epic exclusive? Because that's how games end up kidnapped as Epic exclusives... and as poetic as it would be for DOOM's social commentary on capitalism to bleed into the real world... NO. Just no.
This video felt kinda like one of those old illuminati confirmed memes
You need a break
It is not purple cube it is Kevin
I love this video! I don‚Äôt understand why so many people hate it.
How would Dark Cloud connect to all of that?

Like FFs 1-5, it has elemental crystals as well (well Dark Cloud 2 does, but still) called "gems", so it could be possible that Dark Cloud, Final Fantasy 1 and 3 are set in the same world (totally is at least for my story ha ha) and may even connect to FF4 too.

But that my idea on a connection. 

So would a game like Dark Cloud, one that not really known about, connect to all of that??

Well anyone with better theory making could try to think of something. 

Most of my own Theories relate to Dark Cloud as a whole, and a good majority are related to Toan's father Aga *[‚öô <---- lol his sun symbol]*, but yeah, mew.

=}

‚òÄÔ∏èüëÅüî∑Ô∏èüíõ‚ö™
the Tony Hawk connection that this whole thing hinges on via Spider-Man is a big stretch due to unlockable characters not being cannon.
This is a pot theory .
what about halo :(
Sooo Kirby can eat Freddy while punching daisy
Rabbids...
I love game theory but this was really hard to watch...I hate to see great franchises put in the same universe as fortnite, not to mention he made a toy story mistake
Don't forget the Behemoth from ff in mhw.
here I‚Äôll save you 15 minutes of your life: licenses
What about gears of war3
'Beer is gross' -Mat Patt
Matpat this sounds more like a fanfiction than a theory and its a theory that is making my heart ache from thinking tbat doom is connected to fortnite through a shitton of loose strings
It is tie-dust with no t sound
Assassins creed is connected to Final Fantasy
Minecraft?
By the way Mario crew is also in a little gem on the wii called fortune street and in that game you can also play as dragon quest characters plus a Mario figurine can be found in a metal gear game if it makes it canon I don‚Äôt know and by the way rabbids are also allowed from Mario+rabbids kingdom battle which brings in rayman from the party games which also brings I Mario from the costumes from rayman legends
‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs most popular game‚Äù
Apex: hold my Diet Coke
We have a 2319!!!
Metal gear is on its own because it only has a crossover in smash bros
What about cuphead
Claims it‚Äôs all canon and that there won‚Äôt be any smash bros team ups, then uses pro skater as a connection.
So does that mean that Nazis conquering the world is in the same universe as Disney?
Matpat! If you put the points for fnaf 1 costom on 1987 you get golden freddy jumpscare
Greg.
Hey it's like there was a show for this....called crossover
I would have to say U.B. Funkies were the first type of physical world action figures that you can use to play digitally , not Skylanders.
This is really dumb. next theory: every franchise is connected cuz ready player one.
do a httyd theory
7:13 that spooderman
What's the song in the background? at 12:10 xD
If the final fantasy universe is connected you can‚Äôt forget about ivalice final fantasy 12‚Äôs world which is connected to the FF tactics games, and vagrant story a little known RPG from the ps1 era (it deserves more recognition cuz it‚Äôs a great game) anyways with this there could be even more connections but I‚Äôm not sure
Trying to connect games to shrek
Oh Dr odd1sout
Okay this is it he has gone insane
Who played FINAL FANTASY 3 and beat the toy box world? i did,
YEEEEEEESSSSSS DOOOOOM GUYYYYYYYYYYY
This could be way easier..
Thanos in fortnite
Marvle v capcom
Ryu in smash
Cloud in smash
Cloud in kingdom heartsüò¥
I have a theory that they the doom guy is connected to halo and more because of xbox game pass and in one of the trailers we see them all together as the heroes of xbox game pass so that means xbox game pass is connected to the doom guy so now I can see master chief and doom guy having a epic battle or teaming up and kicking everyone's butts but hey that's just a theory
A new fnaf game is coming out!!
if the mat pativerse is real then YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ETN MATT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok you are wrong doom 2016 is a reboot
Inb4 this becomes the new "Sans is Ness"
world's most popular? you know that usa is not entire world, right?
Now we have to find a way to link pokemon
Can Mario say ni
5:00 that's almost deadpool-level material there
Can we make a theory that Robotnik and MecaHitler are the same person?
So basically half the movie universe and the whole gaming universe is basically connected
I want this ultimate game.
imagine what would happen if all these games and series were put together inside a single game, like and rpg, or multiplayer battler. literally everything would turn into some sort of battle between good and bad, and could make a true ending to all series. (plus what person wouldn't want to milk old series to get more money out of them while also allowing them to market new ones)
Mc is connected to terraria (idk how to say it) since they basically held an ad and mc is also connected to adventure time cuz of a texture pack and then adventure time has some toys made by mimoco and mimoco made many things for cartoons and games so that means mc and terraria are connected to real life things and games leading to this theory which brings alot of things.
Dont forget the skyrim referance found in Doom 2016 in the kadingur sanctum.
Cats are liquid?
NOPE NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP
Can we have a fire emblem theorh please im a very big fan of fire emblem and game theory please
Lol , anyone remember Disney Infinity
its about time he did a theory on DOOM
its about time...
Didn't he say the last fnaf is in purgatory
But... Tommy Westphall
Is Minecraft included
Funny enough, Pixar has stated that whatever happens in "Toy Box" is canon in the Pixar universe.

But, I don't think this theory holds any water.
There's references, and then there's actual creators joining their creations together, to make connections to their products.

I like crazy theories, but I think I'm going to back out of this one.
2:24 Doomiverse
Were does undertale fit?
Matt weres minecraft
Connect fnaf using the Mario is in fnaf memes
my god... do you realize you just unleashed the apocalypse on nearly every game ever made... and aqua just got back to her friends too... though I will give you props for this. it is believable to me at least. I don't think the creators know exactly what they've done. would be cool for conformation though.
I know what Disney Infinity is.
This was a mistake
kevin the cube is a tetric block! because they are related
I Love The Quiet.
Hey anyone realize they forgot monster hunter world which had crossovers with assasian creed final fantasy megaman  witcher 3 and street fighter and ext i think
Where is Roblox
Dear mat pat, I think one theory that might be worth some time Is seeing how cold sub zero in mortal combat can get or how hot scorpion can get. Thank you if you do or if you have done it thank you
Most ambitious crossover is pokemon
im sorry i loved the video but i got a head ache after this because it is all so plosiable
4:54 .....did you just put in a character from "a hat in time"? That doesn't count,right?! (Only ahit fans can know this reference)
Mat, you forgot smash flash!!!üëéüëé
matpat. your drunk.
from doom to fortnite to kingdom harts to mario to sonic whats next alix kid i bet somehow espio is connected to ratchet in somway idk
lmao yall still playin fortnite? tetris 99 is where it's at now
Me beast is about to make everyone else hold is 2 beers.
Is love to see Donald destroying everybody in fortnite
Why is mr beast in here
Well here's a true infinite crossover theory (Hold on to your butts) since doom is related to Marvel through Spider-Man and Fortnite he is also related to the DC universe because Hellboy (which is a marvel comic/movie) causeing him too be related to the TMNT universe,the capcom universes, and the Mortal Kombat universe, because it's linked to street fighter through marvel vs Calvin it becomes linked to Monster Hunter linking with pokemon, the Witcher, RWBY, Samus's game i forgot the name of,and the Sonic universe linking you to Mario and the gang, because it's linked to Mortal Kombat it then becomes linked God of War (very important), Alien vs Predator, Nightmare on Elm Street (semi important), and Friday the 13th, now because it's linked to Freddy it's linked to Dead by Daylight linking it to Saw, Halloween, Leatherface (also a mortal kombat connection), and Payday (due to the exclusive steam payday 2 and Dead by Daylight crossover) linking it to John Wick, Scarface, and other things I can't care to name (this really doesn't matter much), now for the most important link because we are linked to God of War we are linked to Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Japanese mythology linking us to things like the gorgon ( essentially medusa's species not all of them are able to turn you to stone though) because of this we are linked to all of Rick Roots books, literally anything that has to do we those mythologies, and my coup de gra Dugeons and Dragons which with the infinite exsistances that happen in that game links you to everything. Matt pat please see this.
the best crossover ever is jimmy neutron and Timmy turner ;)  fight me
"BUT HEY...IT'S JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEORY"Every time I hear that after having my mind blown to hell by science and connections and crossovers and secret code and just amazing nerd stuff I'm forced to remember its a theory a speculation, so to fix this In just click off the video before he can say jack sh-. BUT HEY THATS JUST AN OPINION , A VEIWERS OPINION. THANKS FOR READING
Okay but DOOM is LITERALLY Wolfenstein because american parents were outraged of the fact that there are Nazis on their kids screens
Everything is not cannon
A new fnaf game is coming out
They're all connected because they all exist in this reality
Oof, this theory will be perfect for my game. üòà
Roblox and Minecraft share da same universe as the other games
Ok I believe you
6:19 is where it begins to hurt
Those two toy boxes aren‚Äôt the same though... the one in kingdom hearts is a replica of the real world meaning it‚Äôs still not the toy box world you‚Äôre thinking of. A better connection would be that there is a limited edition Mickey Mouse that wields a Keyblade playable in Disney infinity meaning that Mickey can also travel to the toy box infinity version, but can canonically not mention it as that would break the world border (order). Then the video can continue as normal :-)

Where's the merch at
2137 widzƒô, ≈ºe edytor chyba  z Polski
I have all the disney infinitys 1.0 2.0 and 3.0
my crap is connected to this universe.

 i saw crap in a video game so they are connected
what about fallout 4
Sorry but Matpat I think ya missed a few the mention of Marvel connects all of ace atorny,  Megaman, and street fighter. You did mention skylanders but you forgot to mention that it connects to Mario which therefore connects not only skylanders but also Crash and Spyro. Mario also connect ( If you count the skin and template) Minecraft and scribblenauts. Again if you count the skins it opens the universes of Halo,  Faultout, and Super Meatboy and more .Also, scribblenauts opens up the DC universe which means we could be seeing Master Chief and Crash help out Sora and Mario take out Thanos and Joker while helping link find the Triforce.


But Sonic would have opened up the DC universe anyway by being in the lego dimensons game. he opened all of ninjago, lord of the rings, lego movie,  and scooby doo. The list goes on but I think you get my point.  and thats all I thought of but please notice this cause it took alot of time to write.
What is the opening song tittle??
The f is this theory
Dear Matpat, 
Please don't do this again
Sincerely, O
P.S. I puked
doom guy dies in infinity war üòîüëä
yeah but can doomguy 1v1 minecraft steve?
Watch as Fortnite adds in a FNAF set
Take apart his what?
Matpat you have now lost your ability to do theories on Kindgom hearts.
Is Mat aware of the whole diet soda dementia thing? Oh he is. Oh that explains a lot!
I‚Äôm so confused
You should do terraria next.
What about fifa, gta ,
You should do a theory episode on Pathfinders origins from Apex legends
Matpat u need to play When darkness comes it's such an interesting game on steam and it's free!
All I want to see is Iron-Man, Spider-man, the other Avengers, And Doom guy eating shawarma for two hours of film and a Doom game.


HELL YEA I AM EXCITED BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Captain America: LANGUAGE!
Pok√©mon crystal, ghost girl of glitch city.
You should do a theory on weather you should save vi or Louis In twdg
Hi The Game Theorists. I am your fan. I love watching your video.I've got a new game.Steam „ÄäDevotion„Äã Look forward to your video
@The Game Theorists You should seriously do a Game Theory on the true identity of Q, from Street Fight 3. He's such a mysterious and stand out character, the game and a lot of the material provided  by the creators give you practically no information about him. I figured you may enjoy driving yourself mad finding the identity of such an odd, underrated character.
Fuck,i love the spider-man:into the spider-verse the movie is amazing and is that the milky way in that box
You should do a vid about redeye in octopath traveler
Matpat i know were the mushrooms come from in super mario they grow in peach`s garden look at super mario oddesy (rip my spelling)
What about FNAF INTO MADNESS GONNA LOSE UR MIND AGAIN MATPAT
MatPat: Beer is Gross!!!

1,000,567 unsubscribed from Game theory channel.
NFL IS RELATED TO FORTNITE SO DOOM GUY IS RELATED TO THE NFL!!!!
Hey matpat can you make a theory about how much metal can Sonic take to the head?
You forgot club penguin
There's a called straned isle and it is very interesting
Matpat see pg 143 hyrule historia character comparision chart and tell me the height of Link by the way I am a boy
I have a theory.   

After the events of OOT as we know Link goes into the lost woods to look for Navi. But when he fall down the hole he gets knocked out and found, then put in the shrine of resurrection for 100 years until he wakes up and the events of BOTW happen. All of the other Zelda games were dreams. 

Feel free to add on to theory. And like so MatPat can see.
Matpat the binding of isaac has something called the antibirth can you see what it is about
I wonder... Will you make a game theory about the cube escape game series, or the submachine ones? They aren't that well known, and it would be great if you discussed their lore.
is it me? or MatPat looks like Brandon Flowers?
He probably wont see this but he should do a game theory on Toontown Rewritten , Wizard101, or Franbow(Recommended)
yeah Sonic and his gang can be in fortnite and kirby in Tetris heck even kirby and literally every single game ever in the entire world is connected. Spider-Man and Mario in fortnite.

(This is a joke)
you forgot undertale and deltarune





‚ÄúAh AcTullY tHey sHoUld oNly iNclUde foRkKnife aS oNE uNiVERs‚Äù
Matpat one theory has yet to come 
One theory that you need to overcome 
If you are looking for theory about a tale 
Look again in Tattletail 
In this story has a tragic death
This theory leads to a tragic story
One that only Matpat can solve 
Matpat make this video once you think   you have this riddle  resolved 
.....
In other words do a theory about Tattletail and try to answer  the things above 
Like if he should
Doom guy vs cap com characters. Thanos in marvel vs cap com
Thank you mat pat now I am interested in playing the 2016 Doom that I have on my Xbox that I never played
But 2319 means white sock
23rd letter = W = White
19th letter = S = Sock
Intro was sick
Let me give you a hint, look back on your first fnaf 4 theory.
duuuude this would be so cool I could detroy every one with link and samus
Do a theory on "here they lie" it's a VR game. I play it on the ps4. It's a very weird and creepy game. It has a lot of symbolism and is more like a psychological horror. Really fun and I would hate it if you guy's never know about it.
Matpat read this,, FNAF SERIES"
So are undertale and heart bound connected
Zombie catchers theory
Wait so nintendo is connected to disney wow
Is gta5 involved ?
can u do a scp-containment breach theory maybe on how the scp's were made or somthing
Mega Man?üò•
So exciting
6:07, 2137 its like it was back then, but now we eat bananas with spoons.
I can't believe that you missed the link with the Dragon Quest games and Final Fantasy with them being both Square Enix titles and with the fortune street games.
It‚Äôs currently 12:00 am and I was just about to go to sleep
Here's a good theory if anyone wants to try...




The connection between all the twisted metal games how are they connect I know that people say their all mostly different variations but I feel like there more than meets the üëÄ
KINGDOM HEARTS 3.1
You know the 100 Youtubers BATTLE ROYAL that elrubiusomg did a year ago???
jesus, you made me laugh in this.
The MatPativerce.... YES!!
23-19, WE HAVE A 23-19!!!!!
Well season 8 is already out so request denied. Try again for s9 I wouldnt mind this cross over
MAT PAT!!! I Have a question  you know if a human goes into a animal suit they are furries , so is purple guy is a furry!? ü§î btw i like the video
if your doing more cross overs i personally would love to see how all the indy games are connected
There's also a "king mickey" in infinity if you wanna cross that over with kingdom hearts

And we can skip fortnite by just using the Spiderman figure from 2.0
You forgot Gears of War
The world ends with you could be connected and since final fantasy 15 was in Minecraft, minecraft could be added too
Hope this video was him trolling.
Am I the only one who would play a DOOM game where you tear through the Disney universe?
Do a video on how much is pac man eating on all of his games and levels
Wanking wenesdays
You know matpat, the Disney Infinity is a stretch, so here my way to fix that problem. We can start with marvel since you mention thanos in Fortnite. We can use the Marvel vs dc since the multiverses are cannon. After that, we can connect that with Mortal Kombat. Using that, we can connect that with Kratos from god of war.This can also connect with link for the Nintendo crossovers. We can use that to connect that to the Ubisoft game connection since that game also has Ezio. With that, we can use the Ubisoft connection to connect this with final fantasy and connect it to Kingdom hearts. This is my way to fix this crossover without having too much stretches. Anyone can improve this, so if anyone wants to correct me, please comment below.

Edit: I also noticed that KOS MOS is a playable character in the Soul Calibur games, which connects them to Xenoblade Chronicles. I can imagine Sora Teaming up with Shulk and Link to fight against Inferno with the Soul Calibur in knowhere. Imagine if that became a thing.

Edit 2: OMG. I found out that because I connected Kratos, I also connected Shovel Knight. Because of this, I have not only connected with Runbow, which has Shantae and Lilac from freedom planet, but I also connected with a game called Cook, Serve, Delicious in which in Battle Kitchen, there are 24 cameos there. I am not going to say all characters are there, but one of them is CUPHEAD. I just made more connections than I thought. If anyone want to figure out these cameos, just search ‚ÄúCook, Serve, Delicious Battle Kitchen‚Äù. You won‚Äôt regret it.
Hey matpat, Do a theory on who is the strongest angry bird in angry birds
you posted this aound the same time  i became obsessed with doom  that was some great timing            also doom taking place in 2019 is not true since you said all doom guys are the same person but in doom 3 it says its somewhere in the 2100 i forgot what spisific date but yeah alsooooo doom guy was fighting in hell for billions of years not just 3 decades
You should make a theory about the Sims! Like maybe Bella Goth or something like that.
So the doom guy could take the infinity blade from ib (or fortnite) and meet the worker of secrets?
What is next Doom is connected to Doki Doki!
Could you do a video explaining what the hell Deathclaws from Fallout used to be?
I got a theory that would be cool for y'all to cover is Rachel amber from life is strange pyrokinetic
Matpat have you noticed that when Mario dies time stops
You mean multi verse, not universe right?
I really haven't watched a video you have made that I haven't liked....but when it comes to this one, I did not like it....don't worry I didn't smash the dislike, and Ill still watch your vids.....but did not like this one.
Its starting to feel like there's too much reaching in these videos now. At this point I'm only subscribed for Austin's videos.
I think matpat hit his head too hard
..and sans is ness
just because a game lets you play as characters from other games doesn‚Äôt mean those characters are canon to that game
We need another petscop episode
Fanf VR coming Soon...
So doom guy can now come and squash koopas with Mario, because this legitimately makes sense. Why
At this point games just implement his theories into the actually game
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD SPOT TO FIND SOME INGREDIENTS
Kingdom Hearts has Wreck it Ralph as a link, Fortnite had a Wreck it Ralph cameo on a movie screen. 15 minutes saved.
Let's just put this one into the bin of theories we can ignore
You could cross anything with anything. That's just how life works.
...And since Nintendo made Earthbound that also means that Undertale is connected.
Please do a pt.2 of this connecting FANF
Do you have a place I can submit stuff because there's a cool new series called the umbrella academy on Netflix. It's a short one I binged it for 2 days. Just wondering if there's anything to theorize in that series on 
netflix. EDIT: Just an idea and thought that came to my mind...
MattPat your arms must be 100 feet long because of how much you're reaching on this theory.
This theory proves all these games a Real because KH3‚Äôs secret movie shows Tokyo
You forgot the Monster Hunter universe because of the recent crossovers.
Doesn‚Äôt ‚ÄúNo smash allowed‚Äù mean that half of his theory is knocked out, idk lol?
Have you seen the RE2 mode in pubg too
Has anyone seen the new fortnite letter in it it says "The new powerful Prisoner has brought fire and flame to fortnite and its Islands," This shows that there are more islands and we might be able to go to them and in the opening scene of season 8 the pirates had to have been coming from somewhere other than the main island. Idk but if you see this and think it might be a good theory like it so matpat can see it.
WTF ????????????
I‚Äôm extremely happy you finally did a theory involving kingdom hearts in some way, I‚Äôve been waiting for it for a long time
watch out Disney, doom guy is coming for you.
when matpat doesn't mention Little Big Planet ;c
Extension

If we go off of what you said with Toy Story and how weapons work as they should, we can include Lego dimensions as well. This opens a whole new 'web' or whatever. This brings in DC, Ninjago, and a ton of other people. This also brings in characters from  . This means Shaggy is in this universe as well. Don't mind me asking, but do you really believe that Shaggy and Shrek would lose to Doom Guy? Doubt it.

Okay but in full seriousness this opens up a large spectrum of other universes, we could see Harry Potter duking it out with Darth Vader, Batman and Spiderman sipping tea together, the Simpsons going in the Olympics against gremlins, and the Power Puff Girls chilling with the cast of Final Fantasy.

But wait, THERES MORE
Since we've connected this to Batman, we can also look at some of the people in the Lego Batman Movie too! This brings in SO many people. King Kong, Medusa, Sauron! This connects us to the Godzilla universe and The LOTR universe, and even connects to GREEK MYTHOLOGY. 

And I'm not even done yet. Because RICHARD CHEESE played HIMSELF in an archive recording of The Lego Batman Movie.

Wow for once Fnaf isn't in something
Link is basically doomguy anyway so add that
(Luke from outsidextra, i got u)
Maybe Fortnite and KH but Doom?


DOOM?
Wh-What. I am so confused yet happy yet I understand. I‚Äôm in a crossover of confusion
Master Chief vs Doomguy
Bendy and the ink by scene is actually in the matrix make it happen
Could you make theory about the fierce diarys mask in the legend of zelda majoras mask
This is the most confusing and most unbelievable theory I have heard.
Now they're going to have to add everyone in Super Smash Brothers

I don't believe it. Matpat just shitposted. Nice.
So kerbal space program is in the same universe as Fortnite stw

Stw save the world
noctis, and Negan is already in Tekken 7 as playable characters.
You know I'm split
He is finally insane
Or
Seems legit
When you have time a game recently released called "When the Darkness comes"
super mario rpg is a connection to square enix as well.
Pubg is sharing an universe with pugs
Make sense
If it dpnt work






M a k e i t
4:15 that makes lots of sense since William blazkowicz had  his girlfriend or wife pregnant and maybe there kid was the billy blaze because in one of the missions in Wolfenstein 2 William had a flash back and in the flash back a girl used to call him billy 
so that's why maybe the name of Willam J blazkowicz's son in billy blaze and his kid is BJ Blazkowicz.
please don't mix Doom with that Fortnite trash
Hey matpat can you do a slender man theory now that your "done" with fnaf?
First Diet Coke reference in forever!
Do a Terraria theory, like who was the guide
In fnaf world its somone(you figure put who) playing with the plush aminitronics to     make himself or herself nor be as scared of the aminitronics in tjeir nightmares
nothing better than watching game theory on a sunday
Do a DOOM guy is link episode but really overthink it
C.O.D. Soldier? Bullcrap! I recognize Captain Folly when I see him!
14:03 he called Remy "Ratatoullie"
So therfore sans is connected to the hollow knight‚ÄΩ
This is like the Pixar Theory of video games
So Doom guy is everywhere and everything so....... is he god too
So your telling me that even "undertale" characters can crossover with disney characters
Hi MattPat, I was wondering if your next video could be about you explaining the Mo Mo Challenge. A lot of people confuse this challenge with the Blue Whale challenge and I think if you made a video about it, more people would watch and listen to see what it really is about. If you need help gathering research then just reply to this comment because I have done a lot of research on this topic.
So if square Enix games are connected two. Does that mean Blazkowiz can fight with Rico Rodriguez.
mispronouncing blazkowicz like a pro xdddd
Matpat can you do a video on 5 minute crafts and who they are? They‚Äôre right behind t series!
Make a video on were Nico Billik Is from gta 4
Mat I want to start to thank you... Those videos that you and the team are creating are awesome and I am probably not the only one who thinks about it this way.. I just want to thank you all that you try your best to bring up some videos even if it would be 1 single video in a month or two or three I don't care... They are full of love and passion and the fact that you all are here on Youtube to share whatever you have in your mind with the world is fantastic.. Thank you all for being the once we love..

And I am sorry for misspellings.. I am from Germany and I try my best..
At least know i know whats in the box now
Subgap!!!!
Damn...
It isn‚Äôt April 1st  yet
So much theory worthy content in Kingdom Hearts, and we get a crossover episode. Not mad, just wish we had a full blown theory
That's just a pitch, an elevator pitch
Us Final Fantasy fans over here are still trying to sort out the contained multiverse of Final Fantasy, let alone other franchises.
This doesn‚Äôt make sense
Non-cannon events and limited time fourth wall breaks mat.
Monster hunter has had a Final Fantasy quest line. As well as dmc, street fighter, witcher, horizon zero dawn, fairy tail, animal crossing, legend of zelda, metroid. So i guess those connect too
SQUARE ENIX wants your current location.
I guess you though today was April Fool's day...
Tetris 99 is the most ambitious cross over actually...
I wish you did anime theory I'm kind of curious as to the strength of the explosion of Vegeta's self-sacrifice during the Majin Buu saga maybe somebody else has it I don't know but I do remember when Vegeta blew his self up the crater was really big
Can you do a Danganronpa one
Of all three games
At the end of Kingdom Hearts 3, there is a secret cutscene if you get a certain amount of hidden mickey (lucky emblem) pictures. The cutscence is titled Yoroza and it shows Riku and Sora in a Final Fantasy World with Sephiroth present.
Everything is connected.
Zelda and Skyrim are connected to
I think you need to slow down there buddy
They just used the same engine
Lol what's a final fantasy character in KH3.
And you forgot to point out the fact that far cry new dawn has a spiller cell moments when you find Sam Fisher‚Äôs suit
Matpat do littleBigPlanet please the toy box is a rip off of the imagisfere! connect littlebigplanet!
wilt so how is it conncoted with fortnite
Halo?
Matt is a slave to YouTube algorithm
He covered pokemon in the first episode, along with earthbound.  Also, even though actual theory of sans is ness is wrong, most of the evidence is still there that their worlds are connected.  Deltarune is connected to undertale for obvious reasons, and in the ending burger pants mentions how he doesn't know if the purple guy works here, being a jab at fnaf.  I connected fnaf
who wants deadlock back?
this is so far fetched and I love it
I didnt anderstood a thing
Yikes dude
That's when Sora gets announced for Smash and this whole connecting the dots thing becomes a whole lot easier
Ummm I just came here for kingdom heart's
We must start a riot

MASS EFFECT PART 2!
MASS EFFECT PART 2!
MASS EFFECT PART 2!
The ultimate crossover amazing
Make a midnightevil(game) theory the first part of the puzzle is in coryxkenshin's channel
Mat pat! Did you know that a post you made was seen on text 2meme?
Connected Universe Theory ?
More like how Doom guy is going to Stop PewDiePie v T-Series by killing youtube next.
Hey mat pat. How good are you at escape games...

There is a game series of escape games. It is called cube escape by rusty lake. You are a detective going to the town of Rusty Lake to investigate the murder of Laura. But there is something horribly wrong with the town. I'll let you find out the rest. Please figure this series out for me Mat Pat! Love you vids BTW!
Hey can you do midnight evil theory
Hey mat i got a question. Scarecrow is a Batman villain who uses fear and the brain as a weapon...is it possible? I mean...its based on science and psychology so...
Can you do a video on Night in the Woods
Matpattttt please solve the phenomenon known as the momo challenge
This ain't it Cheif
Might be a miss
Where's metal Gear?
fartnut season 8 came out not long ago.
Mr. beast I oh that guyüòØüòØüòØüòØüòØ
more like king-dumb farts amiright lmao gotem.




Alright, here‚Äôs the gun.
You know what to do.
Just make it quick.
Sorry MatPat, but KH III Toybox is not the same the same as Infinity's Toy Box. The Toy Box of KH III is explicitly stated to be a clone of Andy's world, one created by Xehanort.
You claim to pick only canon connections. But unless Thanos being killed in multiple Fortnite matches is canon in Marvel. I think it's way less canon then Smash.He was just a game mechanic, nothing more.
7:08 normies are usually so late, acting like that‚Äôs a new thing.
IMAGINE DOOMGUY IN UNDERTALE HE WOULD GO CRAZZZY
Hmmmm another theory... Ya
If you created a game, and you get a CrossOver request and you have a rival, you need to risk having to share the same universe as your rival.
Eva unit 01 could fight doom guy
Since thanos is in fortnite this connects marvel which connects evangalion because of the spider verse comics which is connected to a lot of other Mecca shows through super robot wars
But, what about Minecraft?
Mat pat remember when you made that theory about all might having a secret quirk well in my hero academia chapter 214 midorya got to use the previous one for all owner quirk so all might might have been using the previous owners quirk as well
Also we‚Äôre does the doomslayer keep all his Ammo and doesn‚Äôt need to reload
Jeez, thought you guys finally taken my theory in.....
Also the doom guy and the doomslayer are two different people
My brain wasn‚Äôt prepared for this
William afton, a god at robotics.  Doom guy, can smash anything that can be thrown at him. If william afton made a suit like his......................... said to much.
Doom, kingdom hearts and fortnite....
when did this channel become a fanfic?!
Can you do a my hero academia theroy
I actually thought about you doing an episode similar to this awhile ago, so it‚Äôs cool to see this happen, But there‚Äôs still a few franchises you missed, like LittleBigPlanet.. Part 2 maybe?
Matpat please please please complete your doki doki literature club
Really Matpat? Is This What You Go To?
oh no, I thought we sealed all the monsters in the underworld. Guess this one escaped.
Kingdom Hearts: Battle Royale
"Kirby could dine with Ratatouille" Matpat my guy
Radical dude
Thought the sillhouette at 3:36 was the short girl from incredibles
finaly a doom theory
thank you
But what about Star Wars- Garry's Mod- Portal- Half-Life
"Or like my family said H-E double toothpicks because we valued proper punctuation"


Comment if you know what I'm referencing
Watching BoJack horseman as I watched this and the clip on this video played exactly when it did on the episode I think I‚Äôm cursed
Doom guy shooting up the project at Edens gate. Need I say more?
OKAY! Why is it that every single one of these videos makes me want too talk about it with someone. MATT STAHP I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS ;O;
Are you going to play kindergarten number two what on gtlive it was supposed to come out 2019 in the spring
I got an idea for a vid, the identity of the judge of far cry new dawn
Matpat, I know you did the Thor vs hulk strength video but I‚Äôm curious as to how hard Thor would have to throw his hammer to fly assuming he throws his hammer to fly.
Do a theory on BoJack horseman
I am now thinking of kirby in doom
rip subnautica
Oh you know odd1out and mr beast
6:08 yeah it‚Äôs lit in the future
Then we're are the marvel characters at in kh3 how do you know that toy box and disney infinite toy box are connected. How do you know if it's not just a parallel universe where everybody else aka people from Disney are owned by different people or just aren't even in that universe so it's either there has to be 3 different dimensions or they simple don't exist in the same universe well at least they all don't know that there are other disney characters like was Tina from princess and the frog in disney infinite no THEORY PROVINE WRONG AGAIN
beer is better :3
you mean elsa and todoroki
That ain‚Äôt it chief
minecraft is connected to all the anime games ;))))
Sorry, most of these go to extreme lengths to justify a connection.
Omg! I want to see some kind of giant universe connection poster where it's just doom guy jumping through interdimensonal portals linking one universe after another! If you agree like this video and comment! XP
Ubisoft owns spore and that was not in the Ubisoft vid
"Skylanders was first"
I suppose no one remembers the U.B.Funkeys.
Don't you dare ever disrespect kingdom hearts like that ever again
You missed Capcom and Namco I‚Äôm so angry
All the Ubisoft games???



For honor
Finally! Skylanders gets credit!
That A big loop
So are we going to gloss over the fact that dc and marvel characters along with Disney have all been in Lego games before? And PlayStation all stars also ties in a lot of other franchises along with soul calibur guest characters cameos including enzio from assassins creed, link, Yoda, devil jin from tekken and mortal kombat? (mortal kombat  vs dc universe) and the 3 marvel vs capcom games... Smh mattpatt
So did everyone just silently forget about Game Theory's series 'Crossover' with TrailerDrake? Because this is basically a summary of Crossover.
WHO LOVES KINGDOM HEARTSüñ§üóùüóù
Wait, but the fake world in KH3 was created by Young Xehanort. And it was only by splitting that world in two. The connection between KH3 and Disney Infinity seems a bit off.
Hey matpat not to be that guy but uhhh


Spoiler Alert


There are 0 FF Characters in KH3
Though only in KH3
This is it huh. Theory rock bottom.
Put down the pipe Matt
So because a character or two, or even the slightest reference to another series exists, that means they are inter-connected in the same universe that also is the main aspect of an outdated sky landers copy takes place in...

This is sans= ness 2.0

With and extra 10 billion iq
well if all of it is in toy boxes then fnf do have a link there as well or you say if its all fits together or to a computer or the internet its a all one big thing  think abut it if it has a link to a game that has a link to the internet Doom can go anywhere  and will you look at that ralph breaks the internet do have that they even have other games that look like doom there so yarh... youre welcome
MatPat, my man, I am 99% sure that videogame references do not mean "shared universe". By that logic, Steven Universe is canonically related to Sonic, Final Fantasy VII and Sailor Moon, and Yu-Gi-Oh!! is related to The Simpsons.
Am I gonna see the Doom guy fighting Thanos in Avengers Endgame
Hey matpat you were right about fortnite it is on venus my evidence is that i got a survivor in save the world and it is an astronaut his bio is "the first man to walk on venus" and in your theory you compared fortnite to venus so there guys like this so mat can see
Wait, if Doomguy was in quake, then that means it‚Äôs also connected to Tf2, since Team Fortress was originally a mod for quake, also meaning that any of the characters in the connected universe could just be spy
Wait what about just cause. rico and doom guy, the ultimate team or rivalry.
if you count mispakman in grnul 3 and smash bros and Rick to Ford theory Rick can clash with D.K. and the unicorn seed whut the hay then Discord will fight with Footer Strange. and tf2 reprint map and dokter who who papers in Lego Dimenchons sow Bat man vs doom guy vs pit.
Starlight jupsaered ever pony and the sons wud spring trap's.
Add yokai watch 3 as well since chocobonyan exists and checkbox and moogles too
No Ubisoft powered up heroes? For xbox 360?   No? OK...
hay matpat get around to yume nikki wanna hear ur thoughts about the gaem
All those games are doomed
but halo is safe right?







Right?
And in reality this whole video is just a secret riddle or a test to the community...
ITS JUST A  G A M E   T H E O R Y
First game theories ok
Then he is in a musical of fear the musical 
Then back to game theories...
This is the next sans is ness theory
What about transformers
Do a theory on little nightmares. please!
And why has there never been a transformers movie that was set on Cybertron for the whole movie
Are u gonna make a fnaf vid where u tell the whole story
And if Isabelle and Villager were in Mario Kart, doesn't that mean that Animal Crossing is connected too?
Yall, Mat wasnt trying to say that all the games are cannon related. Hes just looking for tiny pieces that links them together because, well, that's just what he does.
11:05 name of the music pls? (yea, yea darude sandstorm would be a funny comment for sure)
Nobody:

OMG I WAS JUST WATCHING MR. BEAST
I just got a theroy for you but its a bit shakey. In final fantasy XIIIII, when noctis looks at insomnia afther it has ben destroyed, everyone but promto calls someone to tell them they are not dead. What if promto has nobody that loves him or he loves?
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ
Do a vid over the momo thing cause people are going crazy cause it was a meme at one point pls debunk the thing
I see no StarCraft. Thank god
You realise apex legends is killing fortnite
Who else would love to see Doomguy walking around with a jigglypuff
And then there's the (wild) theory that link is the doomguy
What about doki doki
Hey Matpat? I haven't experienced this Mo mo bull crap but I kind of wanna know what's going on. Can you help me out?
this makes me happy
1:35 I am a Czech and everbody around me (Kids too) drink Beer sooooo HOW COULD U (P. S do not take it seriosly)
The future is great
so basically all games series are the biggest crossover you can get? i think you could do better games that only had one or two games like saints row. or batman
TBH You. Forgot. UNDERTALE/deltarune. Omg matpat we needed this.
I hit myself in confusion
Matpat. Make a video on we happy few. Thanks
Couldn't you then use Tekken and soul caliber?
Tekken:  Noctis Lucis Caelum to Negan(Walking dead), Akuma ( Street Fighter), or Geese Howard(KOF)

Soul Calibur: Link or Ezio Auditore to  Spawn( image comics), Geralt of Rivia (witcher), 2B(Nier series), Kratos  (GOW), or  Lloyd Irving(Tales series). 
and then Kratos leads to Mortal Kombat and PlayStation Allstars which 
Line 1: Mortal Kombat: Kratos leads to Aliens and Predator series, Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, and Freddy Krueger.
And that leads Dead by Daylight with Freddy Krueger:
Dead by Daylight:  Freddy leads to  adding in the SAW and Halloween series 
.....And I'm Done!
This is the most coincidental theory I've ever seen.
Please make a video on "When the Darkness comes".
That would also mean that Papyruss could be dropping out the battle bus! Flowey could appear in the toy box! And Sans could appear in Smash Ultimate! Like if you want Sans in Smash.
The intro looks like YTP
This video convinced me to buy the next doom game.
danget fanf wasn't in the crossover now im sad ;c
Um, thanks to the existance of Creepy Castle (by Dopterra),
Five Nights at Freddy's is connected to Shovel Knight, The Binding of Isaac, Cave Story, 1000 Knives and Super Meat Boy.
(And IIRC, Shovel Knight is then connected to God of War and so on.)
Also, if you like making theories, I believe the many scenarios of Creepy Castle will give you enough material for that. :)
I love your videos but i dont even know what I just watched lol was this just a massive six degrees of separation challenge?
This is such a massive stretch. Also doom guy in fortnite? Really? I just have no words for that
So your saying that every game character ever created lives in the same multiverse




Seems convincing
OMFG... He's lost it.
There's a possibility that Void Termina and the Ender Dragon teamed up to conquer the planet Mars while trying to avoid Shrek with a gold scar carrying Solid Snake inside a ? block on his back in case he needs backup in battle.
By including final fantasy you can include monster hunter. With that all the crossovers from Monster hunter over the years
Do a theory about the words and ending scene of minecraft
that opening was awesome
I WANT One MORE FIVE Nights AT Freddys
make a theory about  the new gen 8 in pokemon
Even war and peace isn‚Äôt gonna be safe
Oh. So now I understand why this crazy doom guy is pointing a gun at me...
Minecraft tho
Hey try a borderlands theory
The intro confused me i had
To double check who i was watching
holds a pump shotgun battle royal SIGN ME UP
Stop it...get some help... Pls 
We care about you... 
This is not ok
Hey Mat!,I have question!,What breed is Isabelle from Animal Crossing,and what age is the villager in Animal Crossing?
Final fantasy had a united universe game, it's called Dissidia. Maybe they should make a Dissidia 2 for the ps vita with the newer characters.
Matpat: Smash bros and PLayStation battle royal

Heroes of the storm: ‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù
Doom guy vs master chief
Just Noticed The Doom Guy Looks like xisuma
technically FNAF could be joined, because the PC Game universe is accessible
Oh god I want to see an animation of the doom guy going everywhere and beating up absolutely EVERYTHING
Of all the kingdom heart theories this is what you make?!
Seems like Matpat had too much caffeine again...
What the f have you brought upon this cursed land.
U SHOULD DO A THEORY ABOUT MIDNIGHT EVIL
14:20 WHAT ABOUT POK√âMON!!!!
Do u mean the fnafs box alltho there is only ded amy or who ever was it omg the box is actually the toybox all is in rhe saem place infinite realities woah :) we aint goin to die if the universe of ours explodes there is always a n uneverse where a super volcano dosent exist XD neeeeeeeeeeeerd is a me maruo hehe
Mat you just made the Super Smash Bros Ultimate but with games
so i googled thematpativerse and google told me it wasn‚Äôt a thing
I had no idea what he was saying most of the episodeüòÖ

But I still really liked it and that‚Äôs probably my fault because I‚Äôd never heard of most of those games. It‚Äôs just funny he talks to fast and gets so excited about the crossovers it‚Äôs a amazing to see someone so enthusiastic about something.
I don't think Fortnite can go with any game
Explain to me how DJ Marshmello from our world went to mars to meet Fortnite characters
Video idea: 
Super Mario Sunshine: Can the Hover Nozzle actually make mario Hover?
Remember that Noctis is in tekken 7? And tekken share universe's with street fighter, KOF, FFXV, and the walking dead.
THEORY: C.O. Of doom guy is MASTER CHIEF
Uh theres a level with cloud in kh2
Sorry, could you repeat the part where you said the stuff about all the things cuz I wasn't following.
What battle in this universe would be the most powerful and coolest
FF XIV had a crossover with MHW so that means...
matpat is wub confirmed
Matpat first you're wrong about the Ness is sans theory
no angry birds? 0/10
I wish fnaf was included because if it was I would love to see enard,nightmare and the one you should not have killed team up to fight doom guy
This is to much for me and im a 13
Really love the doom intro
Check out this game  MIDNIGHT EVIL(the game coryxkenshin played, number two on trending at the moment)  theres some hidden lore i cant seem to get my hands on it would really help like if you agree
A theory on Hollow Knight would be awesome! There's so much to work with and the new game with Hornet was just revealed so it'd be nice to know what the heck the whole story is before that releases
You should do a we happy few theory
But if the smash bros franchise is allowed then the universes of metal gear solid, shin megami tensei (persona), bayonetta etc would be opened and by the way minecraft too would be included as super mario mashup pack exists, and halo would join too as there is a halo skin pack.
Do a theory on midnight evil it has many things in it mainly when you beat it but still
Yeah no thanks, i dont want to see mario running around in apex legends.
Can you make game theory about black water in Red Dead Redemptionüî¥üíÄ
In crackdown 3 is the agency still evil
Matpat could you make a video about could we build a motherbase from MGSV
just look at a miror thats reflecting s mirror
You can also connect to monster hunter worlds from final fantasy  and then to witcher 3
U should include smash bros Mat come on
doom guy went to hell and so did purple guy and the animatronics do you think he hit freddy with a left hook
LOL Derp Spider-Man
we don't need to hear about fortcraft
I hope Fortnite won't be connected with any game or I will commit not breathe air
You‚Äôre talking about the doors right?üòÜ
I dont play fortnite but I would if fnaf characters were added.
Do anthem therory
This ain't it chief
Actually you can connect FNAF because minecraft have an official map of the mushroom kingdom and a mario costume and in stealing the diamond (henry stickman games) their is a creeper blowing the museum and in fleeing the complex their is freddy trying to scare you.
AMAZING!
Their is to much theory in this theory
My head hurts
Who else re-read the title mid way after watching the video
they hated jesus because he told them the truth
Marvel: We have the most ambitious crossover ever.

Cartoon Network: Hold my beer makes fusion fall
Luckily, Halo is not connected.
Master Chief would be turned into titanium spiced mince meat by the Doom Slayer.
you know, legend of zelda: link's awakening is getting a rework, it was my favorite game but one of the darkest ones (acording to de  complex zelda lore), can you make a video about that? PLEASE??
Square Enix huh? Doom Guy vs Rico Rodriguez :D
you know! you are right i have done much much MUCH research and all of my res
earch points to your theory
Also square cinx help with the just cause series and that would open up lots more
Please like so he can see
MATPAT MAKE A SLIME RANCHER THEORY NOOOOW
We almost got through a gt episode without hearing about fnaf
It‚Äôs connected to Mario witch conects it to yoshi and there‚Äôs the yoshi Easter egg in deltarune witch conects it to undertale and the amount of Easter eggs in undertale conects everything to everything!
PUT THAT THING BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM, OR SO HELP ME!!!
they arent in the same universe dumdum
how about backtrack?
Oh god not this again
I WANT TO DO MY PART... BUT I NEED YOUR HELP (PEWDIEPIE)
Hmm.. now the shadows have passage but missing is one link to set them free......
Hey Matpat, so I've been wondering about this ever since the new nerf on Fortnite, the Deagle used to be able to destroy a single whole wooden structure mainly made of sticks and small logs which can support a human's body weight, how strong would it have to be to cut through every log?
what about the secret zoo level? when will we hear more about it?
Yeah...
Sometimes I just feel MatPat forgets to sleep and has basically diet coke for blood when he comes up with these theories. Continue what you're doing. Love you.
"all games are connected" I KNEW IT! I KNEW Poyo poyo Tetris and Dark souls shared the same universe!
Apex suffocates fortnite, Doom guy confirms the kill. No more flossing kindergarteners, theyre too busy annihilating demons.
Remember Steve can easily destroy and hold a universe oh wait...
I think you should have released this on April 1st
DOOM GUY V SPRINGTRAP ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
I believe Half Life, Portal and Splatoon are all in the same universe.
He obviously didn't play Kingdom Hearts, so many assumptions XD
Really scrapping the bottom of the barrel here MatPat
Do midnight evil I feel like you got a challenge her approaching for the midnight evil
Hmmm... this one is just a bitttt of a stretch...
Shrek can be in smash
Doom guy vs John wick.  Discuss...
This theory is really far fetched
How many times are you going to make this video?
That opening though.
Doom guy is Link, didn‚Äôt you know?
ahem.... where is Undertale and Deltarune?
Film Theory: How old is Spongebob?
This is worse then the ‚ÄúuNDerTaLe iS EaRtHBOunD‚Äù theory
So what I got is Pro Skater using a bunch of popular characters accidentally connected most of the video games in existence (and some movies,books, and shows)
Can you make at theory on We Happy Few. Preferably anything you can find.
6:07 in respond to the Editors note cus i am from the year 2137 i'm here to say what its like...






it actually kinda sucks :P
In Kirby the amazing mirror there was a power up called smash and to get it u had to fight master hand
You should do one on midnight evil the game cory played
Honestly, doom should only have crossovers with ID games
Finally you did it you actually did it you talked about DOOM thank you
I couldnt help but smile at that intro
This is cool and all, but I won't be impressed until you put doom guy in zork. Or at least pong.
DO A THEORY OF MIDNIGHT EVIL
PLEASE
if doom guy went to the halo universe......lets just say somebody's got some nice green body armor
Matpat. Out of curiosity, I went and searched your name into Wattpad, and boy was I surprised
make plants vs zombies
 video
Square enix... Rico rodrigez in fortnite and disney?
Please do a Blackout club theory some time.
Here is a random question. Does anyone know who payed Muffet to kill Frisk in Undertale? Other than Gaster. According to the text box this mysterious person stayed in the shadows and appeared to change shape. It was on the Switch version so maybe it's different than other versions of the game? Well other than Mad Mew Mew.
The most desperate attempt to connect worlds. I call major bs.
0:17 missed opportunity to post this on the 23rd.
Fnaf can be put in.......Look at Easter eggs MattPatt some mini games point at mario style games we all know how cheap the people who own the pizzarias are meaning they changed the game
Maybe they don't want Nintendo sewing them after all the parents that have XD
if Final Fantasy is part of this big mush of franchises living within the same existence wouldn't Yo-Kai watch be here as well you can literally get a version of the mascot character riding a chocobo
Do a theory on midnight evil
Are we not addressing the fact that his taxi ride into every other game from Doom was literally skins from Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater game?
Please don't ruin doom by putting doom guy on fortnite
I think he meant a different kind of coke there in the beggining


But I think the point here is to say how if you count tiny references, basically all media is in the same universe: The Media Universe. 
All is one. 
One is all.
This is literally one of those "Half Life 3 confirmed" theories but unironic.

How do you do it, Mat?
matpat may have lost his mind in this theory making 

take a rest mat
14:30 my Kingdom Hearts experiences (I and II) in a nutshell.
You forgot  monster hunter Wolrd because FFXIV(Fourtheen) did a collab with MHW
There is a Kingdom Hearts/Silent Hill crossover fan fic.
If Ubisoft is connected into this...that means the South Park gang is in there too!  Enjoy.
Matpat just told us all every movie and video game are basically combined I LOVE IT
Doomguy in Smash anyone
Decode the Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield video
Now do deldarune,undertale,and cave story
Final fantasy has a skin pack in Minecraft and from that you can rope in Steven universe, doctor who, halo, and from halo you rope in destiny
Disney connects to Pixar witch conects to Ralph breaks the internet need I say more
Does anyone remember these games having Ghostbusters references? If so, then ho boy.
what about momo challenge is that true or not?
what about 2k titles
My brain hurts
You lost me in the first 5 minutes.
I mean... you aren't wrong. Of course probably 3/4 of these games will never have a cross over but it's fun thought. I want to see doom fight Mario to the DEATH NOW.
Is it odd that the weirdest part of this theory video, to me at least, is finding out Comander Keene is related to Doom guy?
on the windows version of Final Fantasy XV, Gordon Freeman appears which means Half-Life and Portal are also in this universe.
James Halliday has entered the chat
Hi matpat can you do a theory on black panther's plant that gives you the power of the Black Panther
First time Matpat said the word Skylanders....(btw I like that game)
Quake 3 on ps2 was f**** amazing
Jesus Christ this is actually pretty amazing
this became meta
We need a video where Matt just lists out everything he ever thinks like some random üí≠ on weird theories or links.
Confused Screaming
Sans is ness 2.0
I've seen this game and it called midnight evil and I was wondering if you could chek that out
Shoulda been a cross over episode
Jesus finally! So many years and you only do one video on one of the biggest, most successful and longest running franchises in video game history: Final Fantasy. You did one video on it many years ago and never touched it again. I LOVED that video! It's nice to see you finally mention it for once. Would love to see more theory videos on the series!
Wishing for a midnightevil theory
mat please do an episode on midnight evil
This is just a big Crossoverception.
Do a theory about midnight evil
Do a Pacman theory on why the ghosts are out to get him, possibly Pacman killed the ghosts in Thier past life like this so he can see
I thought the commander Keen shadow was Edna mode
MatPat, I think you need to sit down and take your meds, and by meds I of course mean Diet Coke. :)
2:02 you mean H-E-double-TOOTHPICKS!!!!!!
I‚Äôve been looking through the comments and not a lot of people like the Kingdom Hearts Series besides me... 
rip xc
Look deeper mat there are way more crossovers then that.

Ps sonic with a keyblade that would rock!
Final fantasy is also connected to monster hunter(collaboration)
And monster hunter is connected to the witcher (another colab)
Hmmmm, I smell salty commentors. It wasn't a big deal when he did this exact same thing six years ago. You'll live now.
so becasue shrek is in tony hawk everything fits.
Can you explain midnight evil it confusing plz
To all you destiny fans, what if the taken King was never really dead and he had a plan to cause forsaken. Think about it, he killed the queen and that lead uldren to  seek the barens. Like if you want this to be a video!
Monster Hunter has crossovers to a few of these games
I‚Äôm just going to ask what where all thinking: doom guy vs thanoss
copyright in 3. 2. 1
Heard of the six link rule üòè? All things can be linked with only six actions
Is this some kind of off season aprils fools joke?
couldve gone without the fortnite link but interesting to know how the original doom links so well with other games
Matpat, next time you do one of these you should look up the game Namco X Capcom and it's subsequent games Project X Zone 1&2. Even if you aren't counting stuff like Smash or PSASBR as just games with a lot of characters thrown in, these crossover games are more in the vein of Kingdom Hearts in that there is an active plot that the crossover characters are participants as well as an original set of main characters the game follows.

If you play your cards right, you could probably extend this Game Theory into Film Theory since this franchise connects to the Super Robot Wars universe (which is a canon multiverse in itself already) so you already have a huge bunch of Anime as a jumping off point.
This is a weird video
Even for someone who's been watching you for three years
stop giving fortnite attention. I want it to die.
you forgot that in final Fantasy 15 you can get the HEV Suit from Half Life
So in conclusion, Half life 3 confrimdz?
I would love to see this real.
U didn't talk about wreck it relph
I've been waiting for years for a Commander Keen reference from... Literally anyone
when you‚Äôre in space Vietnam and the trees start speaking teddy bear
The blaskowuts is German so it would be pronounced blazcovitz
why are there 3 quick audio stops starting from 11:10?
Matt please make an undertale video I am begging my mom is dying
Do cube escape paradox
Crooooooooosoveeeeeeer!!
Do a video on lethal league blaze. It‚Äôs my favorite game and I want it to be scienced?
Just cause 1 2 and 3?
Yee Yee Yee Yee Yee Yee yee
put the tinfoil hat back on XD
You forgot HALO
Good and cheesy intro
This is how I can rewrite that one fanfic! But we need a DC link! Wait, we do! DC has crossed over with Marvel, and Spiderbat's a thing! Now to prove that Sora is actually Superman's son!
If Final Fantasy is crosse over with Mario and doom guy is in Final Fantasy then shouldn‚Äôt Doom guy be super smash bros ultimate
Don‚Äôt forget the just cause franchise because there was a final fantasy sword in a mountain
Sora, donald and goofy (in this order)
So it's infinity war but for games.
Doom guy coming to Earthbound and defeating Sans before it becomes a Skeleton
Sans Is Ness / Smash Refrence In Deltarune. Undertale And Nintendo In The Same Universe. Fnaf Refrence In Undertale = PurpleGuy In Fortnite
You left like fallout and skyrim and there is and easter egg in doom 2016 that shows skyrim protagonist`s helmet.
Nice one matpat, having a subtle don't drink alchohol PSA
6:08 I don't think anyone would be watching a video from a century ago.
This has to be a april fools joke right?
Matpat is my spirit animal. Spirit YouTuber? Whatever
Can you make a video explaining how pokeballs work?
Aren't there a lot of mario references in one of the zelda games?
Xisumavoid would love this theory.
It would be could I f call of duty was in there he only talked about the cod soider in tony hawk
Can‚Äôt wait to see doom guy fight Steve from Minecraft
OK, I'M DONE WITH MATPAT, THIS IS THE FINAL STRAW.
How big is the fortnite map
Can we connect it to big Chungus, though? Can Doomguy find de wey to him.
Mr beast...... Mr beast Mrbeast
Is there any connection to looney toons so my boi big chungus can fight thanos
You forgot minecraft, roblox... literally any game with customizeable characters.
So if Minecraft bedrock has the mario skin pack, and a halo skin pack, and if that's cannon, that would mean that the Doomslayer could go to the Halo universe and fight the flood.
You aren't taking any more victims like me this time Matpat, no more crossover theories!
If the final fantasy connection is true, than we can say that doom guy is able to interfere in tekken due to Noctis being in tekken 7.
Who else is watching in 2137?




I know me neither üòÇ
Forza Horizon 3 and 4 have the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV
I have seen monsters Inc.
And there was no video games
Minecraft mods. Litrly everything is conected
HA.
His name is BJ.
Did somebody say, CROSSOVER??!!
Ffxiv also connects yokai watch and monster hunter world
If all game universes are connected then where's halo in all of this? Sure, there's a connection to be made with DOA since Nicole 458 is a combatant but i don't think it goes much farther than that. And yes, this is a direct challenge, MattPat.
What was Matpat smoking cause I need it rn.
I used to play dinsy infinity with my best friend but I don't see him any more
I can't help but wonder if there's a way to connect mega man with this...then a very very old game could be real.
Matpat kinda looks like an even more geeky version of sam winchester....
What ze fa^& did i see?
I don't think that was diet Coke you just drank....
...okay but like doom and fortnite would actually be pretty cool lol
0:48 wait what??üòÇ
y did thay call hi BJ
Actually the doom guy in doom2016 is not the doom guy in the original doom, if you actually properly researched, doom guy original is a human who just so happened to stopes hell 4 times but The Doom Slayer (doom guy 2016) is a demigod/deity who is an immortal being unlike humans, doom guy original is not the doom slayer because the doom slayer has been fighting in hell for as long has hell existed but doom guy is just a soldier 
Still a great video
Spooooder man
And they say Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover attempt ent in history

Also KEEP THAT FORTNITE FILTH AWAY.
Okay, this isn‚Äôt related to the video but you need to find out Bloodhound‚Äôs (Apex legends) gender like you did with Pyro from TF2
There's a Creeper custome on Terraria.
Minecraft shares universe with the Re-Logic Metaverse
Actually it is implied Wolfenstein (Not the reboot series but Wolfenstein 3D) DOOM (1 and 2), and Commander Keen all share the same universe.
"dine with ratatouille"

His name is Remy you uncultured swine!
Even though this is a stupid Theory idea, can you do a theory on how much a ‚ÄúBell‚Äù From Animal Crossing is?

I mean, c‚Äômon. You did a game theory on how much a single Ruppee is from Legend of Zelda! üòÇ
"Doomguy has been kickin interdemensional butt for over three decades" Actually over tons of eons.
what about roblox? on roblox every game is a different universe.
So happy to see Commander Keen show up in this video! I love that game series! More people need to play them, especially Commander Keen: Secret of the Oracle, Armageddon Machine, and Aliens Ate My Babysitter! Much love <3
Fun fact: transformers made a canonical crossover with Spider-Man in one of the comics. Btw, said comics were made by marvel. So let‚Äôs get Optimus prime playing go fish with buzz light year
cmon guys
he's just trying to have Fun
its not a serious video
stop being jerks
Can you make a crossover web
halo?
Psst. MattPat, PG is in hell, doom guy fights in hell.
Yo I love your theory‚Äôs  but this is just one of those ones that just such a stretch it‚Äôs just annoying
Calm down
Everybody is here !!Super Smash Brothers all characters of the gaming-universe confirmed!!!!üòè
So... maybe Mario will be coming to Fortnite!? Honestly though, that'll be sick seeing Mario running around with a Pump, or with a Barret heavy sniper!
Watch them release a monsters inc. Battle Royale
You could say it was a Doom-iverse
stop
Ill give humans a little longer, before they go extinct
The human species:

A-Austin..I don't feel so good..
The game theorists + kurtzgesagt... THE MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER
Dying is easy, young man, but living is harder ~George Washington, Hamilton The Musical
"Life is impermanent and dying is easy" -Austin

THE one thing I tell myself everyday
"Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying."

-Arthur C. Clarke
I liked him better screaming, but I like him silent too.
Omg they missed the opportunity to call the expansion ‚ÄúSubzero‚Äù
On the topic of Subnautica, how hot would the thermal knife have to be, since it instantly cooks any small fish it hits
um,, the Precursors in subnautica are still alive, they are downloaded into the cores of their structures.
You didn't need to make this video. Anti-Vaxxers have already proven your point.
They should make a channel called "The life theory"
Life is hard and death is easy 
Ok got it.
I guess we are just going to ignore the possibility that we might be in the first 5% of alien civilizations? Okay...

Not like alien civilizations can kill themselves before establishing a significant presence...
At 3:08 why was Austin's cigarette producing bubbles instead of smoke?
ü§ö     R*FpNeF1FiFcL

üëç     Drake
I‚Äôm waiting on your awesome piano music and screaming Austin. 

C‚Äômon dude, SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When you started talking about the fermi paradox kurzgesagt came un mundo and then the great filter 
It is a great Channel 
BuT iT dOesNT CoVeR gAmE pHysICs
Anyone knows what's the song at the end that Austin used in this video? Please
I feel like I just watched a science fiction movie but the twist at the end of the movie was that it was a nature documentary.
Dying is easy if you have an unhealthy lifestyle.
May the odds be ever in your favor
You could say that we have limited resources which equals limited existence time.
humans: WE NEED HELP!!!
Gene Roddenberry: I know only one man who will help...








 THIS CONVERSATION IS ILLOGICAL!
Anyone else thinks that both Mat and Austin would make great lawyers?

Edit: that‚Äôs a crap ton of likes
I'm gonna be honest that fecked me up because it sounded like you were leading up to a pleasant resolution and you just cut it off damb üòÇ
Where's the intro!?
When you were explaining some of the most deadly diseases you forgot. LUMBAGO!!!
Missed a quote, Arthur C. Clarke said, "Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying."
"Neat" -Me, watching a video about the extinction of the human race
Anyone know the outro song, i would really like to find out. Thank you
Austin: ‚Äúshows Drake equation‚Äù who knew you could learn the formula to calculate the end of the world when you are in 6th grade

Me, in 6th grade: umm. Wtf does that mean.
0:42 Calm, evil, counting Austin is actually terrifying.
I learned that from Smart Banana
And fermi paradox from KuRzGeSaGt birds
This is why Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars. A world killer only matters as a great filter if your species only exists on one world. The more we spread out across the solar system, the less likely we have extinction in our future
I have tried everything trying to find the outro song, Shazam, Siri, google, the comment section, my roommates. Does anyone recognize it?! It's driving me crazy.
Anyone want an ark Theory i would personally love to see one
Just by looking at explorer notes can show so much lore and there out on the internet
Voice crack on "early AcCesS" 0:13
HOW DO YOU KNOW IM IN 6TH GRADE
I think humans proved humans are going extinct. Example: global warming being a political issue rather than being a scientific fact.
What happened to Habanera in the intro?!?!
Enrico Fermi: Where are the aliens?
Possibilities: They probably died after the Great Filter
THANK YOU!!!!!! I have wanted a subnautica theory forever
FINALLY!!! SUBNAUTICA!!! THANK YOU!!!!
3:11 - Paused.

I used to be good at Math...

Until the Alphabet had to get involved.
we haven‚Äôt found any from the Drake equation because it wasn‚Äôt
God‚Äôs plan
Curtz-cezat

Also austin we dont know if the precursors are extinct since they came from other planets and quarantined the Khraa bacterium on 4546B
Seriously Austin? I wanted a video about the science in game?...not something that makes people depressed....
Bad idea........bad. idea.....
Game theory I hope you read this can you check about the series song:Benzene series I need an explanation about the meaning of all the song because the song was too too deep and I think u also will don't understand what happen at the song I think the series had 6-7 song and it is from 7 years ago
Please I need ur help if you feel interested please make a vid about it
Still waiting on MatPat and Austin crossover
scientist:evolution is real
Also scientist:life can be only on planets like ours
Me:fk science
Welp we need that master chief tier luck then :)
Can you make an dark souls 3 occelotte video
Our filter? Overpopulation, we don‚Äôt leave earth on time and different opinions lead to world war three, a mass extinction event
Me at the beginning of Austin vids: what.....?
Me at the end of Austin vids: Wowie. That makes.....sense?
But that‚Äôs just a theory! A game theor-

FBI OPEN UP
You just put me in a existential crisis üòÇ good video tho keep It up üòä
YOUR ON #48 TRENDING GAMING AUSTIN!!!
AUSTIN!! that was a beautiful phrase, "walk with me down the dark path of infinite"
Do a theory on the physics of yoshi's toungue
I'm in 7th grade, and I have never even heard of the Drake Equation. idk what you're talking about.
At Least let me say my Prayer's. 






Before a Video Game entity comes to devour us all....
Listening to Austin talk about the possibility of life on other planets makes me want to watch videos on that rather than subnautica now üòÇüòÇ
I don't know how much havy minecraft is?
We have all seeds amount in minecraft....
But how much havy minecraft is when we have all the seeds and fully world loaded?
I'm intrested to know how much fully loaded minecraft havy is?
Austin I think you might need to work on a better bedtime story...
okay I‚Äôm going to cut this video down to a few words

WE ARE F***ED!!!!
Show as a ghost leviathan in a vid about subnautica BELOW ZERO
Nice you make a video about a theme "Kurzgesagt" made a video about three years ago... just to talk about Subnautica. ^^
>estimated 154-6300 potential alien civilizations
>250 billion stars in the galaxy
>where is everybody?
We're looking at a glass of sea water for evidence of fish, my dude. There is no paradox. To assume there's a paradox is to greatly underestimate the scale of the universe.


At least that's my outlook on the whole thing.
My braincells are already extinct
This made me contemplate my existence. Thanks :)

Sincerely, Austin
Can you do one about the strength of links shield in smash ultimate just look at the trailer where those beams of light were able to disintegrate Bowser who withstood a black hole but links shield deflected the beams like 3 times
The Drake equation releü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è drake must us this a lot
how to survive subnautica 
You cant even tho its just a game and that game you cant play multiplayer from other friends
The Drake Equation? So God‚Äôs Plan was God‚Äôs plan all along
An overall calming episode. Not too much yelling, information that I didn't know before I watched, interesting subject, kept my attention, gave me something to resurch. Solid 9.5 out of 10
A subnautica-Theory? uuuh^^
The last letter is an L


Coincidence? I think NOT!
Starts up episode wh wh WHERES THE MUSIC
Who thought that this was going to be matpat's video
Hello i am starting a game do you aprove 
Vallients is a open world RPG set in the waste lands of North America (New America) 3 years after the bombs dropped in America's Desperate attempt to decrease population in 2037. The waste land‚Äôs radiation has caused many mutations to the environment and the remaining inhabitants of the wasteland.
On supply runs you encounter enemies such as  mutants and bandits. The player is also suffering from amnesia with flashbacks. These flashbacks slowly reveal the lore of the game and the true natures of the player‚Äôs past.
Pray for me guys because I'm watching this right now and didn't finish the game cuz I'm lazy
random question - how strong do super smash bros. characters have to be to launch others at speeds up to 1500km/h? (smash ultimate)
I need to play through mass effect again, not andromeda though.
Subnautica Below Zero is actually the prequel to the Ice Age movie.
I knew the Fermi paradox already.
Game theory should really do a video on hollow knight.
Please can you do Biotics of the Mass Effect universe.
Also the zoo cartridge has a sequence of letters on top of MADE IN GERMANY
Anybody else feel like this theory didn't really need the subnautica tie in so much as just using it as an excuse for  doing the theory video?
Wow, listening to Austin talk about our inevitable doom gave me goosebumps, that's a first.
I know what our great filter is




ANTI-VAXXERS
Oh you‚Äôve done a video about subnatica great because I love this gameüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòéüòéüòéüòéüòäüëçüèª!!!
Hey austin would the dragon from shrek be capible of flight
Edgy 13 year olds: "Humans are going extinct? Sounds amazing."
Say it with me:
Kurzgesagt
kerz-ge-saut.
Idk, tho. :>
Don't warpers count?
They were made by the aliens
Joke's on you, I always experience existential dread.
me 50% of the video: "oh yeah this is a subnautica video"
I miss the AUSTIN who couldn't stop YELLING!üì¢üì¢üì¢
The Fermi Paradox sounds like the perfect example of the Problem of Induction
Our great filter? Climate change. Scientists have already been estimating our extinction by 2030 if we don't start reducing carbon emissions by a serious amount.
People: oh ok Subnautica was fun 
Subnautica below zero: * exists *
People: OH MY GOD-
One day your Child is going to watch those Videos.
So why not write a Comment for the future-Child to read?
Anti- Vaxxers, start taking notes
What is the song at the end of the episode?  It rocks!
When he mentioned Fermi paradox I got really excited because, YEAH, Austin! I AM a fan of Kurzgesagt and that was a really cool video!
i legit thought that Drake (the musician) made equationsüòÇ
For a second there I thought Lovecraft possessed you on making this video


I guess he did, huh?
THANK YOU. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!
Dear Austin,
Your videos just aren't the same without that warbling lady and can can in the background. It really gives you that mad-scientist-running-around-the-room-with-his-hair-on-fire kinda vibe.
Sincerely,
My Ears
I didn't know how someone could make your show any better than it already was, but great Scott you've done it.
It's like 200% Austin.
I love you finnaly a video on subnautica
5:47 You know, turning off airplane mode might work...
Ahh, Invader Zim... body 2:32
You forgot one major THREAT




THANOS * snaps *
MR. MATPAT! I have ONE thing to state that you DIDN'T do! You did a game theory on Doki Doki Literature game the "first dating game to actually have an amazing story" - Which this is wrong! Mystic Messenger was the first dating Sim game to actually have an AMAZING story! And it indeed had creepy vibes just like Monika, in fact now that I think about it, Mystic messenger might've influenced Doki Doki a lot from the two stories.
CAN WE PLEASE LIKE THIS SO MISTA MAT PAT CAN SEE!
You know this whole Great Filter thing and there not being anyone else just kinda proves that there might be a creator or a designer. You know, like an Almighty God...
We are goin extinct???

takes out violin
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight
* Looks at recommended *
Me: Oh sweet another game theory about my favorite game again
Y‚Äôall should watch the end of the world podcast by Josh Clark
This is SCIENCE!!!!!!
Science is ART!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish you wouldn't scream. Your video is fine without playing side show Barker.
Glad to see even Austin knows of the great Kurzgesagt
I did the Drake equation once, and got 9/500 of the galaxy.
You: WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE HAHAHA
Also you: PLAY THE HAPPY MUSIC
"Where is everyone?" Anyone who believes in a divine creator: "um it's just us for a reason"

Austin it‚Äôs all because of one multiplication problem 

me its going to be another big number video 

Austin R* Fp Ne Fl Fi Fc L 

Me oh $#!¬•
It wasn't bad, but...it wasn't as amazing as usual. No screaming about how Terrifying something is. Barely any over the top excitement. This just...doesn't feel NEARLY as exciting as your usual work.
You channel tittle justify "made up" things. 1:09 "come up with something cool" followed by words of common sense.
Has anyone made this joke yet?
"one simple multiplication problem...*speaks in greek*"
My goodness AUSTIN! I LOVE IT! I LOVED THIS EPISODE!!!!!!
Its pronounced Kurz-ge-zat
they all say that the human generation will last forever....




MAYBE................. you are scaring me dude
The one I use whenever anyone brings up global warming.
Noticed something. Look at the writing on the thumbnails.
Green = MatPat
Blue = Austin
... We're all going to die.

No really, no one lives forever ;)
We still would have a 50% chance of making it through the next filter... each filter is independant, there is just a .1% cumulative chance of making it that far (when assuming that each filter is 50/50).
I learned a lot and I love it thanks Austin. Great work.
not through the video yet (11:30) but i gotta throw out the question: what if there is not only one great filter - but several? Two? Three? Five?
I see fourteen million six hundred and five possibilities, and in only one do we succeed...
I completed the main game and played through the whole story line in sub zero
Now i believe stephen hawking's final words
THE MOST INTENSE MATH PROBLEM EVER. TO SOLVE THE REASON WHY WE EXIST. ON GAME THEORY DUN DUN DUNNN
You know I hear a lot of people complaining 'if there are aliens why haven't we met them yet?'. I propose a simple solution, for every one thing that exists there is 'the first', think Leviathan from Mass Effect, Iconians from Star Trek or Precursors from Halo, now what IF and I say if we are 'the first', what we are trailblazing the path for all intelligent life to follow. It puts things in a certain perspective for me and gives us as a spiecies a role greater than most do. #humanitywanking
Ahh now I remember why I‚Äôm still subscribed to game theory
You should do an episode on the most deadly power in avatar
I think you need more hurdles for communication; what if the civilization only talks with underground signals, what if they cannot decode our signals, if they have decoded them, what if they haven't translated them?
Drake Equation 
he he
Thank you Austin for making my thoughts about life even more depressing
Next Video: 

How Tik Tok proves we stray farther from god everyday
I would like to ask for a theory about who is rex's parent's exactly from xenoblade chronicles 2 because I've been looking everywhere for a video on this but no one has made one that makes sense so I came to you.
humanity:watches this video


humanity:*chuckles* im in danger
"making the rounds on youtube" just shows jacksepticeye's channel page
Matpat. Can you do more undertale / deltarune theories?
Silently throws Austin in an asylum
Combining Austin and subnautica my 2 favorite things

‚ÄúA math problem you learned in sixth grade.‚Äù
Me: um excuse me, but I DEFINITELY did not learn that math problem in sixth grade. As a mater of fact, I STILL haven‚Äôt even seen it.
Do how many Pok√©mon live in the world
Finally subnautica theories!!
2:45 who the hell are you and what have you done with AUSTIN?!?!!?
Nothing but scare tactics and fear hype.
"Neat" -Me, watching a video about the extinction of the human race
Never thought about the fact that People who watch game theory would also watch kurzgesagt
Can't you do this on your OWN channel
I knew fermi paradox through kurzgesagt too lol im asian.
Oh my exterstensial crisis is here I must have played for express shipping
The one thing I always think about when hearing about the Drake Equation, the Fermi paradox and great filters is this.

What if we are the precursors?

Maybe we're the first. Maybe in 10 million years it will be our ruins that other races crawl over, looking for relics of the past. Maybe we're the ones that emerged first, will pass among the stars first, will colonize and cover the stars first, and will die off or move on first.

I see all these sci-fi universes where there is vast old races that came before us, where other races have been around far longer than us, but what if it's not that way around?

Just my 5 cents. If anyone knows of any good series based around humans being the precursors, let me know?
@ShoddyCast@The Game Theorists.
Austin you should make a video about how tough the structure of Rapture " Bioshock" or how the vigors make no sense and how it's impossible to change someones genetics like in the game.
That‚Äôs what I tell my child before putting them down




To bed
This is beautifully edited üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
I am somewhat convinced that we passed our great filter. The day a single cell species ate another species, and that species started to coexist with its former prey - the mitochondria was born. 

Seriously without that Union life as we know it wouldn't have evolved. I like to think that is a rare event.
there are no spoilers for sub-zero. just some visuals so you fine.
or bc the telegenic got out because of a endanger
What if we aren‚Äôt the only life but the life that is supposed to go to another planet and teach the other life froms like the aliens the Egyptians talked about
Thanks to happy wheels on happywheelsunblockedd I made many friends online and in reality, too.
Ok ok give me all the space ship builders and lots of money and you will have a space battle ship

Overwatch ARG pls
2:34 you are not my master!




Only invader zim fans will understand this
Voice crack... must be puberty
5:26 i actually forgot this video was about Subniatica, Austin your maths and astronomy really zones me out of everything and makes me forget everything
Thank you for making a video on this Game! I really appreciate it
Heh is it an interesting coincidence that Austin the guy who owns a fallout channel has the last name  hourigan like frank horrigan from fallout?
Who are you...I watched game theory and film theory before....I feel like I have missed too much
This video started And I'm thinkin, "You better watch yourself Austin"
I did not learn any of this in six grade
Matt's channel fills you with determination!
Existential crisis.......fun for every 14 y/o like me....... Yay
The only scary part of this video was the intro XD
I freaked out when I heard a different voice.
Well, we are working towards a arsenal capable of killing us all. Not there yet.
So you say only 0.1% chance of life passes through the great filter huh... Well, we could just create 1000 different human factions and at least one will make it through üëç
Humans will always be guaranteed to be extinct, no need of concrete evidence
One of the last places I expected a reference to Robin Hanson; just goes to show that the field of X-Risk is way too small.
wow he guessed my younger cousins grade wow great job bud
Best intro ever
‚ÄúNever tell me the odds‚Äù
-Han Solo being optimistic
Be like Han
I think it's more likely we will destroy ourselves with war or greedy businessmen sucking all the resources from our planet than asteroids or disease.
Also; cats are very intelligent, they may not know how to science bro, but they know how to psychology!
Finally, you've made one theory on Subnautica.
How do you know where exactly subnaticas galaxy and if its not another timeline
Do an kingdom hearts 3 ending explained
Any one else think that this wasn‚Äôt really a subnautica theory?
I love the game theorists and kurzgesagt
when i saw a leviathan in thumbnail I didnt have time to think nor react of clickin the vid
hey, just a quick question, Austin ma boi. HOW DO YOU USE THE DAMN DRAKE EQUATION??? It's for my fictional universe i'm writing
.1% chance of survival? at least we have it.
The Great Filter Could Also Be Behind Us
Maybe We're The Only Ones?
Hey Austin. What if you did an overwatch video on why Mai is the deadliest or somthing like that. With her ault snowball. Thought it might be interesting.
the thumbnail looks like a shitpost and I love it
@matpat could you string together a rainbow six siege theory with all the new stuff they‚Äôre releasing like the shorts üò≠
Tis video was amazingly well produced, it was a lot like a documentary!
when will this video get copyright strike as well as the others
lol
They were wiped out by the flood.
Reminds me: MAKE A DAMN FLOOD VIDEO!
The Precursurs aren't extinct, they fled the planet.
Keep in mind, .1% is a lot more than a 0%.
5,4,3,2,1, Below zero you missed a great joke
Dear Austin, 
Please make more videos! It makes me feel smarter. ‚òª But I guess that‚Äôs overrated.  

Sincerely, A B
I love Austin is vids üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
I like matt's voice better ._.
The kharar diden't obliderate the pre qursers, the pre qursers just transfered there mind's into there version of the univere-wide-web!!  (Ps: cute kitty cat :3)
Where is the screaming? YOU ARE NOT AUSTIN
Saw the Google Drive screen, got excited 'cus Austin always makes great videos
Hey Austin, if you're so desperate for a video about Subnautica, how about biology of the Leviathans?
wow i really like your videos, but i have to say, this is really really well written. congrats :)
Austin you are dumb
Everyone knows that Thanos will be the end of humanity
(edit: i know he wiped out only half of it but idgaf)
At least we know why Austin hasn't been making any videos in a while
Kurzegarst is my favorite science channel on YouTube!
Goddamn those perfect voice cracks.
no, obviously, our great filter is a meteor hitting earth, giving rise to Edmundium and the corruption it brings, aswell as a huge lizard.
Dear Austin, 

There is one thing I do not agree 100% on about the great filters. If it is true that there are a filter still to come for us, it doesn't mean we are going to go extinct. Like the many filters before us, they don't guarantee an extinction. Like how you mentioned that your cat doesn't have higher intelligence like we do, but she is still alive. There still are single-cellular life forms even though it also is a filter. We might never surpass the next filter or reach it but that should not mean we will die because of it. We might just bump into that filter and we might just not figure out how to go past it but we could still live in the "place" we are in right now.

Sincerely,
Me
"Intelligence is overrated" Somebody hasn't watched TierZoo
This video really helped my depression üóø
You should put a link to Shoddycast in the description
5:51 I don't know if we will or when we will contact aliens but you could at least turn off flight mode to increase your chances
Yes


      -me
Austin, I need to make a small point my friend BUT it does NOT discredit your theory. If anything it makes it even BETTER.
Although the Emperor Leviathan DID evolve on the subnautica planet, the PRECURSORS did not. They are sentient aliens from another planet who were dying from a disease and came to the planet to research it's life and a potential cure for the bacterium.
Y'all need to do a theory on The Forest.
"Fuzzy wittle happy face" was all I needed to hear today
Me:I don‚Äôt want rule the universe it too much work
30 years later becomes space president And sends 1,000,000,000,000,000 Warships to attack an hostile alien race and successfully make them extinct
I find this version of Happy Room on Freegames66 very interesting, I‚Äôll stick with it.
When I heard you say the Drake Equation, I got really excited.
Oh man, it's such a simple problem 2:51
The aliens message is on airplane mode just turn it off and they will answer
Can you do another theory on Destiny 2
This falls apart when you realize we have yet to truly discover our own oceans so thus have loads to discover on our own planet..
Austin the only person who can go from taking a video game to saying are world is gonna end
Matt looks like Barry allen from CW
Your voice has drastically changed since the last time i saw one of your videos. you sound much younger and far less stressed/tired/sick now. good for you!
Im on 6 grade yay i will know the end of earth
0/10 no mentions of naming a seamoth bubbles
Austin you don't need to tell me that humanity will fade away and die. I already knew that.
Ahh, i needed my weekly dose of existentialism
To all you destiny fans, what if the taken King was never really dead. Think about it, he killed the queen and that lead uldren to seek the barens. Like if you want this to be a video!
Austin:I fear no man but that Dritten 25207 It scares me
Watching your vids makes me wanna oof myself irl
I think a common filter many people don't think about is fire. You cannot create a controllable flame without a special atmosphere. Without fire you cannot proceed into making metal tools. That is assuming metals are even common on the planet where intelligent life evolves. The aliens we meet in Subnautica will never be space faring because of their aquatic limitations. There might be tons of intelligent life out there, trapped under ice caps, floating in gas giants, even farming on land. But we will never hear from them.
When the drake equation came up I started having a seizure
I had a random thought today and since science is done here I thought I could get an answer, I was wondering, how many g's of force would traveling at the speed of light inflict on you, and what kind of damage would it cause?
DO A TF2 VIDEO PLZ
you should do a theori on yandere sim
As soon as you said ‚Äúgreat filter‚Äù my mind went instantly to kursgesagts video
Will you ever make a video on hollow knight?
This was actually one of his best episode
Elon Musket will save was right?



Right?
0:14 I like that sound you make xD
Subnautica didn't doom humanity. Humanity in subnautica was doomed. Just wanted to say
plz do the dmc timeline
8:06 on the left its dende from dbz what a lad
I want more subnautica vids
Hey, mat pat (and Probably Austin) when hytale Will be released will you do an episode of it on GT live?
Millions of years from now, another species will unearth the fossilized remains of humans that depict them with vape pens in their mouths and cheeseburger stains on their t-shirts
Well subnautica is on a different planet
AUSTIN'S BACK MOTHAFUKAS IT'S PARTY TIME
Yandere simulator who is fun girl
Austism. Austin and Autism...
What is wrong with me?
Yea but hopefully the new shrek movie comes out first
In clash royale there's a new vid with the mini pekka. and WHAT IN THE WORLD DOSE IT TAKE?
If Austin was a teacher and sounded this energetic, school would be WAY better.
Could you stop making my anxiety worse, thanks (jokes, jokes all the way. My overthinking is what‚Äôs making my anxiety worse)
Yeeeesssss! Kurtz... kurk... kurgsa... I know them too!
The Fermi Paradox, as it is represented today (or in this video), was not actually posed in this way by Enrico Fermi, nor was it a paradox. Fermi actually took the absence of signs that aliens have visited Earth as a sign that interstellar travel is not possible/desirable, not that alien civilizations are rare. The Fermi Paradox and Great Filters are also not concepts that are taken too seriously by astrobiologists, as SETI has so far only surveyed 0.00000000000000006% of the observable universe, so it is incredibly premature to make any conclusions from that that alien civilizations are absent, as we have barely begun looking.
I won't lie, I had to click away. ;~;
come at me bro, i live in Denmark and as a programmer, coffee is what i run on...  :)
We're stuffy behind two great filters. Colonizing our solar system (which is probably only 50-300 years away) and colonizing our galaxy.
Thanks for the nightmares. üò∂
Humans are going extinct 




Better Subnautica theory how can you walk through floor
when he said Drake Equation I stated saying kiki do you love out of nowhere
I feel pretty confident humans will get through it.
Honeslty I think people want aliens to exist simply becuase they feel humans are alone, and in an ever expanding galaxy that can be terrifying
2:52
To quote Hannibal, ‚ÄúWe will either find a way, or make one.‚Äù
I love you you smart screaming bastard
FINALLY SUBNAUTICA THEORY
Wellp I need some therapy now but good vid
And this is why we had people claiming the end of the world on cardboard signs.
why do we assume that other races would have better tech/be older??  Couldn't life have formed after us or with us??
That background music tho
Gunna just say it. This new editing is fantastic
8:50 heyyyy 








Sorry personal bias
Dear Austin, The Precursor Race is not from planet 4546B. They came to the planet looking for a cure for the Kharaa Bacterium. And the Precursors did not evolve form some creature on the planet. Sincerely sfo PS I love the videos.
FINALLY, A SUBNAUTICA VIDEO
Highly mathematical, but isn't this all just supposition?
WEE SNAW
I am so glad my favourite theory youtube channel made a video about my favourite game
2:15
.....Uhhh? Did I click on Game Theory or Lovecraftian Horror?
Austin you're the only thing keeping me subscribed to this channel
Yes i like kurtzgesagt
What is the song playing during the video?
What happened to: But hey it's just a theory!? A Game Theory!?!
Im too early....






Who here drinks water?
Did he just make extinction sad but fun
Make a game theory about geometry dash
But-... But-... But speed of light!
This is also a variable.  (biohistory.org).
Just because it doesn‚Äôt exactly match our idea of intelligence doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt intelligent life.
So... what happens when shaggy uses 100% power. nice.
Kurzgesagt is the reason I understand any of this nerdy stuff
Thanks to Austin, I‚Äôm starting to believe mad scientist means neither crazy nor evil. But instead just constantly angry. Mad scientist.
time 420 i seen that
I think the other great 'filter' that isn't considered enough is time. I mean, in the time of the existence of our universe, humanity has only been here, and evolved enough to not only send, but receive and interpret signals for an infinitesimal period.  There might be upwards of 6300 alien societies able to reach out in the manner we do.  But how many live simultaneously?  And considering the sheer length of time it would take for a signal to arrive, how can we be sure that we are in the window of arrival? Or vice versa?  If it takes even 1000 years for a signal to reach some distant society, even in a perfect world where they are listening at the right time, it would be 2000 years for a return message.  

But we don't send every message to every corner of the known universe at all times. There might be a society that is 10,000,000 years old but if they sent messages to us that arrived in 2000 years ago, we might not have known.  They might have been sending messages to us for a few millions years, all of which were too early.  To reach every possible planet in all directions, we might have to send a signal from (let's say) every possible sq km to cover all the angles.  There's over 510 MILLION sqkm on earth's surface, and we can't ignore water in this case.  Even if they sent out enough messages to cover all the points tangential to a million sqkm, that's half a millennium to reach everywhere. And then repeat.  Any particular point might get a message every few hundred years, if there isn't interference from planets or a space that slips between the cracks.  And even if one of our satellites or spacecraft going out sends constant messages, we've barely been in space 50 years. Any planet we can't reach from Earth will not have had time to get and reply to a message from us.  

tl;dr  We have to consider the variable of time, how long it takes us to send messages, how long to cover all possible directions, and how long a society is willing to wait for a response before giving up.  If in a few millennia we still haven't gotten alien signals, then we can assume we haven't hit our great filter.
This, honestly, is pretty scary thinking about the possibility that we haven't reached our great filter yet.
Bro theory black hole are actually universes
Thx i showed this to my teacher and she said u ha mve an A now go away (Just a joke,love this vid)
I feel like u didn't talk about the topic at hand enough
When Google drive is open....





You know who it is
yo austin the photoshop image of your beautiful face uh... i know its probably snow but it looks like some mad dandruff
You should do a game theory about if the XO suit‚Äôs in anthem are possible
From a living stand point,the brain is useless,it needs a lot of energy, very delicate,easyly to damage.
it seems like Austin's theories are becoming much darker since he stopped screaming. Coincidence?
Can you do a subnautica video that‚Äôs actually about the science of subnautica?
I know this was Kinnnddaaaa about it but not really about Subnautica 
Do a video on something like the science of warpers and how they work (you would be good at this cuz of the portal episode) or the size of the subnautica planet or something about the entire planet
Best Place to kindle the Curious Human Being inside you.
YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE






YES IT IS A MICROWAVE
Mr. Austin... I don't feel so good...
When I was watching Austin went 5 4 3 2 and then the vid stoped to load
2:53 WHAT KIND OF 6 GRADE DID YOU GO TO
So basically.. We're doomed.. I thought SJWs are going to be the end of us..
We should always be cautious of the unknown, but the chances humans will be wiped out by some alien disease is really low. The "bacteria" never would have evolved to deal with human physiology, and our immune system would simply treat it as foreign, regardless of what it is.
Likewise, we probably won't infect other planets, since all the diseases we carry with us won't be familiar with alien physiology.

But we should always be careful.
im 6:46 in and i can tell you that the theory is we are the first intelligent life to be brought into existence in this current iteration of the universe. thats what i believe is correct anyway
Robots would not stop life from expanding if a population is killed by AI the AI will be just as expansionist if not more.
Wait. So how is this about Subnautica? All I got out of that was we are going to die.
Your videos stopped being good a while ago. I think imma unsub.
I love screaming Austin
I guess you can say the drake equation is .... Gods Plan
Would you kindly make video about Khara
Omg at 13:04 my video lagged and and paused just after he snapped lol
Great now Halo might happen in real life YAY
oh god I forgot how unbearable austin's voice is
8:04 Kurtzgesagt thats german
Am I happy... Or notüê∏üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
:3
I watch exurb1a. You'll have to bring bigger guns to initiate an existential crisis.
Calm Austin>shrieking Austin
Btw, the channel Kurzgesagt is German and it means in a nutshell 






surprising.I know
Please do some ark survival evolved about the story and the if the tek or the future of the ark earth is possible
Does let's go = 0 cause 0 is before 1
Your intros gets me every time.
I think the great filter for us is the possibility of ww3
Pls do no mans sky its pretty much subnautica but with more space
Glad to see you back Austin
Hey Ma!! Ma!! We're goin extinct soon!!
Welp we are all going to die
Hou is ed from ben&ed
5:12 We're not actually looking that hard remember that they have to be looking at us when the signal arrives and vice versa 
11:04 It's also possible that it's common for early attempts at space travel to leave space junk everywhere. If you become a multiplanetary species before then and your colonies can survive and colonise further without earth trade, you've passed. If not, you've got to wait until it clears.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm dumb but literally 30 seconds after I finished the vid I forgot the main point
Another theory for Subnautica, (More specifically Subnautica Below Zero), that MatPat can touch on. There's a lot of evidence in the story of Below Zero that points to the fact that Alterra is the villain of the story. Just a recommendation.
9:10 is that a Doctor Who refrence?!
PLZ I BEG YOU, MORE FNAF
I miss the Habanera opening
1:00 mY BoY
Subnautica is one of the greatest video games of all time.
Thanks for making me realize that I am going to die
R u also a fan of ted ed
We didnt learn that in sixth grade...





:/
3:18 Me: ... :/ (My First name is Drake)
the outro song : say goobye by Bob Bradley, Matt Sanchez and Steve Dymond
This man drinks to much coffee...
so this is what a conspiracy video looks like.... Wow
Hey can u make more deadlocks plz it's fun to watch
:50 I'm not really scared of either; bring it!
If shaggy accidently used only a mere 10% of his power, the earth would cease to exist.
I think u forgot to say "It's theory"
Ok so humans are going Extinct , well it's about time cue five finger death punch anywhere but here
Man. You are voicevracking as freak
Then you see matpat saying that thanos was right that we are being overpopulated
Oof subnautica was lowkey kinda scary
Then captain marvel and skrull and thanos and other marvel heroes and villains are impossible
But Austin! It's just a video game!
What happened to your voice
Didn‚Äôt unknown worlds state that subnautica: below zero, is a seperate game to the original subnautica, but is still based on the same universe
Finally! A game theory about Subautica that is even scarier than Subnautica! Thanks for the likes! Most I‚Äôve gotten!
What if extraterrestrial beings have different environments and gasses they can live off of
5:54 of course youre not getting a response. Your phone is on airplane mode!
I just saw a nice inception reference
what was the music u used also big fan
People who think the Fermi Paradox is real because aliens should have found us by now is just pure human arrogance.
I've come to realize, people cannot grasp the size of our solar system, let alone our galaxy, let alone our universe.
For aliens to find us, they have to know we're here and they have to have FTL travel. Both of those are incredibly unlikely. In order to find us, they have to be looking for radio waves too, which if they aren't they'll cruise right past our small 250LY bubble.

I like to point out playing Elite Dangerous as an example. It's a damn near 1:1 scale of our galaxy. Go fly around the Sol system in super cruise, it takes actual years to travel across our system without going FTL. Now turn the HUD off and try and find Earth.
Good luck.
is it possible to wall jump
might aswell made it all on the paradox
I LOVE KURTZ!!!
Will matpat make a game theory  on dark deception?
Video ends with penguins 
OH MY GAWD THEIR SO CUTE
Completely ignoreing we are all gonna die
See the YouTube channel "Science and Futurism with Issac Arthur" if you're interested in some of the concepts he talks about in this video  thumbs up
thanks for depresion
What would happen if a  kirby ate a kirby that ate ate the kirby
Or what would happen if two kirbys succ each other
But if we survive that means that isn't a great filter, right?
Reactions to subnautica bellow zero

Austin:We are all gonna die AHHHHH!!!

Everbody else:Awww look at the cute penguins
like a serious critique of this video, the music is way way too much, it really distracts from what Science man is talking about. Really could do with less, quieter or no music. Kinda a shame really, i cant remember a current GT or FT video that dropped the ball as much as this one at least for sound. 7/10 potential 9/10
Austin where have you been??
2:32 So that's what Austin's master plan is.
I know another part of the equation with the fact that we keep sending in signals and haven‚Äôt gotten a response:

C*

Meaning quite simply they have to care that they‚Äôre getting a signal from another race from another planet from across the galaxy they may not.
Finally a subnautica video, This is kind of coincidental because i just finished the game
Our intelligence will ultimately be the end of humanity.  I accept this.
this episode was so beautiful
why is humanity's likelyhood of survival just .1% we already overcame almost every filter.
Someone has been watching Isaac Arthur
8:05 Funny if you're German and have not the smallest Problem to say the word
What do you think about this new Science-YouTube-Channel: Clixxom Science and Fiction
Here's a theory: The Great Filter you mention in the video might be the Kharaa in the Natural Selection Games. The Subnautica and Natural Selection franchises are in the same universe, and Natural Selection looks a lot more high tech.
I LLOOOOVVVEEEEEE Subnautica
Austin, take this: hands over gift card for walmart equal to the sum total of cookies your local walmart has in stock  That's for the invader Zim reference.  

If i could afford to make this real, I would do so.   SOMEONE GET THIS MAN HIS COOKIES

THIS VIDEO IS LITERALLY SAYING "YES, CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT (or HUMANS, in our case)"  !!!!
Isn't the Drake equation outdated? Does it even take into account the new discovery that there is a galactic goldie locks zone or that our solar system is an oddball system?
So the way I've interpreted this is not that humans will go extinct, but that they will most likely not develope further through the next filter. No previous filters have been extinction level events, rather stages of development.
Who is fe4rless?
What is his name?
If we got to where we are now using your 50/50 model for great filters. Our odds of passing the next filter is not 0.1% it is 50%. The odds that we have got towhere we are might be 0.1% but the odds of passing the next filter are always 50% because past outcomes do not change future outcomes in probability.
Thank you for the spoiler warning! I mean it.
There is also the possibility that other intelligent life just does not want to talk to us. Heck, to them it would probably be like us trying to reason with a dog.
are you the game theorists that i know?
i mean... Is our plane gonna come back after the sun explodes... Cause if not we are going extinct one day. And we don't need proof.
What if, like Austin said, we haven‚Äôt passed the great filter, or, what if we haven‚Äôt found any new species because, we‚Äôre not advanced ENOUGH...
Could you put the songs from the vid in the description? Maybe pls
I don‚Äôt know if this is true but aren‚Äôt most habitable plants like hundreds or thousands of light years away, doesn‚Äôt that mean we are looking in the past. That means there could be a civilisation but they haven‚Äôt boomed in population and industrialisation yet. I don‚Äôt know if this is true so please don‚Äôt get angry if I‚Äôm wrong.
Says spoillers 

Ooooooof
Crack the code Ecqwb6a0b
Just a small correction. Subnautica Below Zero isn't (or at least, not right now) an expansion to/for Subnautica. It's a separate game. I bought Subnautica on sale when I heard news of Below Zero, only to find out about 2 weeks later that its separate...
One plural noun...... Zombies
But what does that have to do with Subnautica?
Thanks for the existential crisis
i dont know why but i just opened fnaf world today and just got it and it said "i'm broken thats why im here but i will save you i will put you back together" can someone explain why
If you are interested in this concept, I really suggest listing to the podcast 'the end of the world with Josh Clark'. It is all about the existential threats humanity is either facing now or is about to face. 10/10
Congratulation you made me more suicidary
Dear Austin (or MatPat), 
Since you ruined almost all of my favorite games why don't you go ahead and ruin my favorite. I am talking about Warframe. Now don't be ashamed if you never heard of it it is ok. But let me tell you something about Warframe. On it's cover you see space ninjas in space ships and all. BUT when you go into the rabbit hole that the lore of this game is, you see how complex it is. It is a story of multiple civilizations that ruined each other and  how the great war played out. The universe of warframe is huge so you might not be able to get it all in one video but i am SURE that you are gonna find something. Something so small even the most try hard lore fans didn't find. So..., with that said, I challenge you to do an episode on Warframes lore or something that you find because i am sure you will. I know what kind of dirt you menage to find. I have time. I can wait a few weeks maybe mounts, but i expect you to find some thing. 


P.S. I love your vids keep it up <3
Congratulations Austin, you have made me watch a full GT video and give a thumbs up.
finalyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Isn't  Subnautica the prequel to the Natural Selection games?
That equation goes sicko mode
Episode about Subnautica? I'm in dude! Finally!
Austin, are you okay?
just read hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
2:05 With captions on
Did anyone notice Austin used bubbles instead of cigarette smoke. It was at 3:03
Except we have a 50% chance of surviving any given filter, no? The reason there‚Äôs a 1% chance of survival at the end is because it‚Äôs compounded with the previous possibilities of failure
5:46 airplane mode
REVIVE ShoddyCast
I waited 2 years for Austin to make a video on this
5:47 exactly how do you deliver an iMessage when your on airplane mode and not connected to WiFi?????
YES FINALLY A SUBNAUTICA GAME THEORY! THANK YOU!
we go extinct whether or not we like it cause the suns blowin up in a gazillion years and wiping out everything near it and anything that survives will be consumed by a potential black hole
I went back to this show and I is soooo cool i love it, great job!üëç
i used this for my science presentation
the equation looks like planetfall when we first see it
I freaking love Austin ... it‚Äôs unhealthy how much I love his videos
They should a vid on unmechanical. Weird game backrounds, the world your robot is on has meat in the ground and facilitys.
Bird Box was just based of this episode
can you do infniet sonic forces
NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS
At 12:24 what‚Äôs the song cause I dig it. Also thanks Austin, I wasn‚Äôt prepared for and whole crisis situation until I played Nier Automa- or whatever
I love you, but YOUR CRAZY
Off-topic question, but have you guys ever looked into doing a theory of The Witness? It's a long game of puzzles, but it seems to be full of mystery and open for a lot theories!
Finally a video on subnautica
make astronner gqme thery pleas
Anyone know the song used at the end
Dude what were you learning in 6th grade? I‚Äôve never heard of the Drake Equation and I‚Äôm a freshman in highschool üòÇ
Back to walmart i go to feel normal whilst looking forward to extinction
Im slowly going extinct
Before I see what equation it is I'm going to guess the Drake equation
The Fermi paradox, in my opinion, is fundamentally flawed. It assumes that intelligent life hasn't found a better method of transmitting information then light. Light has many downfalls one you mentioned is it's slow speed but I think the actual issue would be one of visibility. You see, light base transmissions can be easily intercepted and can lead back to the transmitter, this was an issue in early night vision tech. Perhaps more advanced civilizations simply upgraded to a better way of transferring information and non really use the old outdated equipment we're using. Perhaps the Fermi paradox, isn't a paradox.
Hehe omfg I love austin
I‚Äôve already gave up on humanity redemption so this actually makes sense
We‚Äôre too busy destroying ourselves to think about all this üòÄüëç
Apex legends lifelines healing robots is it possible?
The problem with the Drake equation is that it assumes that other planets have intelligent life, while we haven‚Äôt even found basic life on any of the many planets we‚Äôve searched. While it‚Äôs possible, or even probable that life exists elsewhere in the universe, we have yet to find proof of it.
What if the great filter is AGI? There are people fighting to stop AGI, a lot of irrational pseudo-scientists are out there instilling fear into people over an I, Robot scenario. The flaw of which being that I, Robot assumes people wouldn‚Äôt just be able to tell Robots that their priorities are not matching up with ours, and the robots were too naive to figure that out on their own.

I‚Äôve been reading about the great filter for a while, and one issue perplexes me. We are on the cusp of AGI, AGI does not need the same requirements we do. AGI can live on the Moon or Mars or floating about in space with nothing more than the Sun powering it. So it stands to reason that machines that are capable self self repair and upgrading should exist soon and perpetually grow smarter than we are. There in no reason we know of to assume they aren‚Äôt capable of population the universe should anything happen to us. 

So if we are so close to AGI, something that should be able to outlive most potential Great Filters... could that potentially mean that other civilizations choose NOT to allow AGI out of fear, and we screw up progress as a result?
And if you go even DEEPER then it is a Freaking scary horror game
They are not great filters, they are just natural event we need to survive, you talk as if all this has a meaning, this is all just nature taking it's course, not a right of passage we have to go through.
Dying is easy. Life is hard. So why not try our best.
I always knew math would do us in
I forgot he was talking about subnautica until 10:37
Humanity's blessing and curse is our intelligence... It will, and can cause our own Extinction just because.

Our next filter is our own intelligence, with our intellect we will create many wonders good and bad. Many will choose peace over war but those who chose war could and will cause greater harm than any peace loving creation we make.

like nuke, with many restrictions and laws about nukes no one could stop them once the big unassuming red button is pressed by one unassuming person causing our civilization to fall into ruin.

That also applied to people who like to play around with viruses in the pretense of research, one wrong tweak. A zombie apocalypse is coming.
Maybe the great filter is deppresion and the depression may be killing all life on planets
Will we actually go extinct though!?!?!?
I guess that's why its important not to fear death. Because death can come at any moment.
I click away because I don't like Austin
5:54 I figured it out, we just need to turn off air plane mode
Whats the name of that outro
Well humanity was coming to a end anyway so meh
I'm not sleeping tonight
He found a new way to say " if im going down im taking you with me"
We are going extinct. Sounds fun where do i sign up?
It takes place in a different planet tho
At the end the penguins made me feel better
Subnautica below zero should be called.  Subnarcitca.
0:49 I ain't scarred of either so let's go
#letaustincurse
Simple. There aren‚Äôt any other civilizations out there because evolution isn‚Äôt true and we were created by God. The other ‚Äúheavenly bodies‚Äù were only made to produce awe in us.

That‚Äôs the real reason why there aren‚Äôt any signals we‚Äôve ever come across. If evolution were true, then we‚Äôd see signs of life all over the place, but we only see it here. Funny how that works out.
Humans forgot that galaxy is big
I think modern medicine is going to take evolutionary pressure off of us for our genetics to make us healthy, in order to save people. Saving people is good. Eugenics is bad. Saving people may even open up previously unexplorable paths of human evolution. Evolution is a search function (I think that's what it's called‚Ä¶) after all. And you never know if someone who would have died early in their life, will turn out to be the next great thinker. But‚Ä¶ I predict that without some way to counteract the effect of introducing unhealthy genetics into the genepool, more and more pressure will be put on medicine to keep people alive, until it can't keep up. My favorite way to fix this, is to study human genetics, and isolate what genes are responsible for the various major inheritable diseases, and to genetically modify a percentage of the population just enough that they won't have these diseases, and in doing so, reintroduce healthy genetics into the genepool.

But of course, no solution will please everyone. And I strongly suspect that this will be a high controversial topic. It's not one that brings feelings of happiness, at least.
Been watching since I was 7 I am a 5 year watcher and probably one of the youngest viewers
At 3:03 is that a BUBBLE CIGARETTE!?!? Because if so, that‚Äôs beautiful
Ya know, the way you seem to like talking about disasters makes me wonder what you'd think about the Darksiders universe.
sad i liked the caffeine fueled austin better.
I know nobody will read this but for the 1 percent that does, I hope you have a great day and great life. I know fame doesn't occur overnight but I am trying my hardest to become successful. Wish me luck !! :)
Subnatica is from a different planet
1000 ensers but rher's 1 at subnautica
When are you going to make a theory on 'Hello Neighbor Hide and seek'?
I wonder if the Halo series can also apply to this theory...
Based on a few documentaries I've seen, even intelligence isn't enough.
We NEED body parts like hands to handle tools. We NEED to be physically weak enough so we'd have a NEED to develop and improve tools. If we had the strength, teeth and claws of a tiger we wouldn't bother with knives and spears.
We NEED a way to communicate complicated ideas and concept. Meowing, barking and screeching won't get us very far.
We NEED an extreme ever-changing environment that prevents us from becoming stagnant and docile, content with what we've already achieved. Dry this millennia, flooded the next millennia.
We became the dominant species of our world because it kept trying to kill us. The downside to this strategy is that, well, our world kept trying to kill us, and it could oh so very easily have succeded.
You can't be taken seriously if you're gonna use that laughable paradox.

I love how most of these comments are humorous and stuff, and then you come across these paragraphs from people who can't watch a YouTube video about a video game without arguing.
the end of out species will be memes
Glad you are doing a video on this game. Great video hope we don't go extinct and a least try to fix the Earth.
Dear Austin, I really, Really, ReAlLy, REALLY miss all of your cursing and shouting. They are so funny. But recently I found that your video...still have some of those but less compared to old video. That's only my opinion. Nice video btw!!
I will say the explanation of the Fermi Paradox may not have needed to be in depth because there is a super succinct version of it in Hank Green‚Äôs song Fermi Paradox. It‚Äôs a fun song if you haven‚Äôt heard it.

The other filters that could be stopping us besides ai or microbes is our lifespan. There are youtubers like CGP Grey that think that death itself may be something we can overcome but I‚Äôm unconvinced.
Ah. Youtube makes me calm.
What if we are the first sentient life
We evolve beyond the person that we were a minute before. Little by little, we advance a bit further with each turn. That's how a drill works!
remember the deltarune theory? well through it out. Remember how in *g e n o c i d e*, chara says: "lets destroy this world and go on to the next"? what if they moved into the deltarune universe and are about to do another genocide? :thincc:
HEY IT'S ME........Extinction!
I not sure if it's that complicated. I just feel like life is just too spread apart to meet each other.

Plz do a evil granny video!
A comment for this great video
WHERE CAN I GET SUBNAUTICA!?!?!?!?!?
OH MY GOD MATPAT MADE A GAME THEORY ABOUT SUBNAUTICA THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN OH MY-
Oh wait.. It's a The Science video....






okay alright i guess this is fine
Its just a game dude
Ah, nothing like a healthy dose of existential dread to get my day started.
I love game pat and the gang
I like Matt's narration better sorry
You know, there is a game that is a lot like Subnautica AND Subnautica below zero that got an update suspiciously close to when early access came out for below zero. It‚Äôs called Astroneer, and its 1.0 update added lore... If you can call aliens lore, that is. You should go check it out, or at least watch a video or something. Oh yeah, these aliens weren‚Äôt your typical plants. They were a intelligent species that left behind ruins when they went extinct 




(Oh yeah, and wormholes. You know you cannot resist those juicy universal law-bending wormholes).
It is weird that game theory for the first time talking about something I know! Love it
Do a theory about the umbrella academy
Do one on THE SCIENCE of Prey
Forget about the Fermi paradox, I want one of those penguins
That's kinda why I don't like wasteland/no to little npc games
How valuable are planets in space engineers
mat pat could've done this better
Music back at 5:40, I missed it.....
What the hell is the song at the end even shazam doesn't know what!?!??
Lol i actually am in 6th grade
damn that was deep... like the oceans xD
makes theories of don't starve
How is this a subnatica video its more like a space video
I love optimism, it pushes me to keep going. Even if the odds may be bad or not in our favour, I still have hope that we as a species will prevail and step out beyond our solarsystem and explore the Universe... BUT for that to happen we should start solving our problems and stop being stupid and narrow minded. Because in the darkest of times we should stand together.
Heck, even if we are all going excinct in the next 200 years, who really cares right? Lets make it a good time then, have some fun. Not in means of "Lets r*pe everybody!" rather "Lets help everybody and live a peaceful and happy live!". Because why make it a bad time when you can a good one. eh?
so..heads to the sky folks!
Cheers
Curtz. Ca zaht is how you say it
5:54 , you sent a text to aliens and expected to get a response, yet you had airplane mode on.... good luck on that response...
If STEM research is a success I‚Äôll just have to see for myself if humanity survives or not.
Um matpat is Miss countlating stuff wrong
What if we ARE THE EXCEPTION!? WE CAN DO THIS WE WILL PASS THE GREAT FILTER!!
Secret ending is coming...
Oh Austin causing existential dread in thousands one video at a time.
Anyone else miss Austin's old opening music in the background? I miss the background music.
the odds aren't 0.1% to clear the next hurdle, but to get to where we are now. At least according to your video.
that's why aliens have not come yet because we ourselves could be the first sentient consious lifeform to achieve space travel

I clicked on this thinking i was going to watch matpat talk about subnautica and it would be really cool but then we got austin.... AUSTIN



Edit: Thanks for all the likes and also sorry Austin
Watching this while in 6th grade
wHy DiD yOu ChANgE tHe mUsiC?! I was so hyped for that epic classical music
What is the song at the end? Is it a cover of Natalia Kills "Goodbye"?
I swear, Austin is so awesome
Lol we didn't need subnautica for that. Just look at the way people react to climate change. Its almost like theyre like "ok I guess it was fun"
8:08 Yes, I am
Where is the link to whatever starts with a k in the discrcription
This video gave me anxiety
Hey can you do five nights at Candy's Game Theory please thank you

MatPat. I watched your video on the money 1.7 million dollars. What can I do to help.  I can‚Äôt just spread awareness
Cause somebody couldn't figure out if water was wet and made an entire planet out of it

What if we are alone
Everybody know humans will go extinct
How much power is in one of those green power cubes in subnautica
Still waiting for that subnautica theory Austin
That was cool. Not really to do with Subnautica though.
0:14 that voice crack tho.....
I thought you went extinct
what if we just don't exist at the same time as anything else
I mean, the future has a lot of barriers for us, humans. If soon we don't figure out a way to be 100% dependent on renewable energy sources, we'll quite probably go extinct or at least downgrade to a remarkable level, at least technologically speaking. I'm however leaning, unfortunately, towards the first option, since the lack of oil might lead to some serious wars and we'll spend all of the last left resources in that war and everything will escalate from there on. 
If we somehow survive that, we should have an easy time, I suppose, in the next couple millenniums: have to figure out how to achieve global peace, get rid of hunger and poverty, make so that everybody is treated somewhat equal and that's it... That and figuring out a way to escape our solar system before the sun dies and with it all of us. A pretty challenging task, since we have barely managed to reach our satellite in about 200.000 years of existence. Well, we still have about 4,5 billion years till then, but still, the time flies and we shouldn't underrate that thought.
Well, I have high hopes and I'm pretty sad I won't live enough to see that happen, but that's life I guess and the least we can do is contribute at least somehow to that achievement.
I just wanted to say nine words

I think your existential crisis fails to take something into account: Those filters are for events outside of our control. Since we DO have intelligence, all future filters suddenly become challenges we can overcome. The dinosaurs couldn't stop the asteroid from crashing into our planet, but WE can. Every day, we get closer and closer to stopping diseases that rampage across Earth, such as TB. Cats don't need human level intelligence, but I wouldn't give it up for anything.

This is even reflected in Subnautica. The precursers were brought to extinction by a deadly virus, but they had the cure in their hands the whole time! They just weren't able to communicate with it like Humans are able to.

-Sincerely, an optimist :)
Sees title: WAIT WHAT?!?!?!
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat Austin is questioning existence again
I LOVE in a nut shell
Yay Austins back
what is the music in the vid
Never did i think there would be a subnautica game theory
for real, i like it more when he doesnt scream. the screaming is more amusing and the mindfuck of the episode becomes more well, "mindfucking" but Its easier to absorb what hes saying.

Did you notice that when Austin makes a video the thumbnail's writing is in blue, but when MatPat makes one the writing is in green?
Did you know that the human is in another dimension right? In space
Austin! I've got a video idea!
Why is there no oxygen on any of the planets in Astroneer if all of them have plants?
GAME THEORY, i just had an AMAZING discovery!  in duck season when you look at the picture of the mom, and david, with the sold house in the backround you CAN SEE THAT THE DOG IS LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  which means the cartradge is not possesed BUT ITS THE HOUSE THATS POSSESED
When you realize what the theory is at 6 minutes in
Austin... Have you ever stop to think ... that our great filter is actually us, the human race? So prone to division, so often the masses are prone to being blissfully ignorant, so quickly we are to cast blame on the other things in order to scapegoat our way out of taking responsibility for our own ... well, fcuk ups. With all that is going on with us, and all the technology we are quickly developing at this day in age, is it any wonder that when we can never consider, in introspect, that we are our own Great Filter, our own reason for not reaching our greatest potential just yet is because we hold ourselves back?
hahaha that subnautica part 0:10
I mean, like, we haven't even completely discovered everything in the ocean.
The beginning was dark aff
I know it's off topic but can you please answer my question about Smash Bros which is what year is it in the Smash Bros Ultimate?

Ysp , humanity is fu** also the precursers are still alive
Isaac Arthur has a great few videos about the Fermi paradox and great filters
how is this have anything to do with subnautica....?
hey!!!! I'm a HUGE FAN!!!!!!! I watched all your videos!!! if you can......please give me a shout out??? if you don't want to thats ok...i just want to let you know!!!!!!!
-from your biggest fan SamTheKing
The number is probably microscopic, but isn't also possible that even if we aren't the first intelligent species that we are the first to make it this far.
I don't like the Great Filter because it explains the problem as if all species would face the same challenges. In a sense it's the same kind of over-simplification as the March of Progress (that famous illustration that shows human ancestors walking behind homo sapiens) is for evolution. There is no reason to think that what one species would find challenging is just as dangerous for the other. That is, unless the formation of life itself is the one Great Filter but then we are good already. Just fix our problems one at a time and don't worry about issues which might never apply to us!
Everyday life already proves humanity will go extinct.
What is the intro song?
There is an another possibility what if the great filter theory is wrong.
Finally!!!

i want to watch this but i want to play below zero first because of the title.
But wait wouldn‚Äôt that also help us because that could also mean we passed our great barrier and because of the small amount the other (emperor leviathan) has also passed given it has its cure to its filter and for humanity the constant epidemics that has always been solved except the tb thing which may be our great barrier but since this involves subnautica let‚Äôs use those humans. Given how it is mentioned that in subnautica life has been found multiple times and with all of technology like being able to go WARP IN SPACE TO DESTINATIONS to artificially prolonging you life to what an average of 160 years it can easily be assumed that the great barrier has been passed and even more of it being passed as the cure to the end of thousands of species on the planet subnautica takes place on I would assume that the great barrier has been passed. And for real life the Second World War or our many plagues or sicknesses and epidemics like the Black Plague or polio having a vax and small pox almost being gone and even scarlet fever which is so rare doctors are shocked if you have it and during the times like civil war in USA or even all up to the 1900‚Äôs I think scarlet fever was a huge murderer now it‚Äôs basically extinct and the Second World War well the atomic bomb could kill us all yet it hasn‚Äôt because of a heroic soviet man who kept the nukes from dropping and who told us that it one nuke was dropped they all would and that is demonstrated in a popular game series fallout. So remember we might have already passed our great barrier or something much worse than anything ever recorded happening on earth will happen wiping out all life on earth.

Dude scott cawthon realase the trailer of fnaf 8!!!!
Time and Distance could be a technical 'Great Filter' if you wanna get down to it, even from the point of view that every civilization has to have some kind of filter. If you wanna get technical we are similar to many species of animals that could somehow develop further if given enough time, or animals that couldn't as this 'Great Filter' is to us. In Subnautica, if you wanna get technical, through uploading themselves into someone, they could have technically gotten through the great filter that had killed off their species, just not in a traditional sense. Back to the point, I started with, has anyone ever considered the chance that we could live in some remote part of the Galaxy that has a 'Great Filter' on access. What if there are other species who are sentient, but prioritize and function in no way similar to how humans do? What if they manage in a system different than Earth's? As in the relationship Between Earth, the sun and the moon? Distance, heat, etc. What if another life has entered a different type of Homeostasis, or, if that's not the right word, a system that allows survival and growth of knowledge? Now what if all those same species are communicating, but, despite being on a higher level than us, there are things blocking them from knowing or communicating with us? I say or there, cause having access to knowledge of something doesn't mean the same thing as having direct access to it. All ideas of how to travel far and fast enough to get to another planet with potential life without dying in the process are theoretical at best for us as we are. With how expansive the universe is, it isn't that hard to fathom that even the highest and most advanced of species with no limit on materials would have an issue with acknowledging, reaching, and communicating with every sentient species in the said universe. We can't even see the end of the universe, so proposing that any species has the ability to see every inch of it is fairly absurd. Time would be an issue if nothing else. The distance between planets is fairly substantial. Between Galaxies and universes, even more so. Then there's the return to the thought of, they may not function in the same way as us. They may put priority in just finding a species, not actually committing to, or in some cases risking communication. Say a species that manages peace among its own king fairly well discovers us. Say they learn about us and our issues. I'm trying to say there are several things other than a filter that keeps us or others from getting that far. Once space colonization becomes a possibility, what if a species didn't do so through conquesting those with life already developed? What if they instead focused on moving away from planets before their destruction and far out of their range (time, again is the biggest thing here) If you're advanced enough to tackle the constraint of time and mortality to the level of visiting other planets with life, or the potential to hold life, you can probably manage to keep the species alive. Look at the Sea Emperor. It is a highly intelligent species, near undoubtedly more so than humans, But travel to other planets is something you don't even think about for them. Likely because of various limitations. You aren't wrong in not thinking about it, but its babies do live. Thanks to outside involvement, but still. Travel to other planets wouldn't be impossible for that kind of species, just more complex in some ways than it would be for, say a species like humanity. They died off, at least in body, because they couldn't get the cure...stuff produced by the hatchlings which were necessary to be cured, despite being more advanced than likely the human or the Sea Emperor they had captured. All the same, the 'Great Filter' in this case killed the most intelligent species, meanwhile, the most intelligent species couldn't understand/work with/hear when the second/tied for second/third most intelligent species called out to them which lead to them limiting and using the other intelligent species, and their own death. Arguably the least potentially intelligent species ends up being the factor which leads to the Sea Emperor being able to free it's young. I get a sort of, species help each other out of that, and I'm going off topic with that. Something about the Great Filter idea just gets to me. In the first place, the 'Great Filter' just sounds like death in general. All things that could lead to the death of a species. Additionally, just because we develop a certain way doesn't mean all examples of intelligent life have to do the same.
DA DADADAD DAA DA DAN
The great filter will be the red giant phase of the sun

Basically,the sun expands during this phase. It will eat the planets nearby like mercury and Venus,but what about earth?Earth would die yes but there's a possibility we might live. Scientists observed when a sun from another galaxy went into its red giant phase but the third planet survived. Except the third planet was knocked out of orbit. So yeah basically we might die in 50 Million years from now. Also we're not alone, bacteria came from space so that means there's life forms outside of the earth and in space
Who the hell is Austin?? So confused..
The Great Filter does not exist. It is the "Dark Forest" principal that causes the fermi paradox. Read the book The Three Body Problem and the rest of the series to see what the Dark Forest principal is. I feel like that is more legit than the great filter
He said he really wanted to talk about Subnautica, but than only talked about it for like 3 minutes of the video
Death is apart of life we are all gonna die nothing is permanent. Accept it
Since we already have a civilization wouldn't the next great filter for humanity be a 50% chance not a .01% as stated in this video since that number was made for the entire evolution process from start to space bearing not from civilization to space bearing
I really need a Terraria theory...
Welcome existential horrors
can you do a theory about what happens when Mario gets a power like why does his clothes change why does his size change so many questions so little time
Oh yeah yeah
Legend
We are missing one solution I keep telling everyone to add as we are having this right now on Earth. "Information overload" - The static noise of way too much information bombarding us, true false and unknown information, overwhelming our senses, making us fight each other.. making us not know the truth anymore. If we can't figure out how to filter the 3+ Petabytes of data we generate per day, we will just keep crumbling as a civilization.
That's reassuring.
Finally a Subnautica theory
I was thinking about this last week,  not about subnautica, but about the Great Filter. This still makes me question if we, as an intelligent race of fragile fleshy bags of life are going through the filter or we have. I guess we'll have to find out.
He voice cracks
Is the music from the game?
This probably has spoilers for sub zero but I don't care as long as it's not the whole story and even if it is I mostly watch people for their reactions
EXCUSE YOU! I am in 7TH GRADE. Awsome video by the way. Almost got caught using my phone though.
You know what I woke up today and I thought it was going to be a good day but thank you Austin now I'm going to think about how many days I have left
Have you taken into account that planets take millions of years to form that we maybe the early ones?
Never tell me the odds
Here's the thing, in this game, we have already colonized the andromida galaxy. We were going to make a multi world gate on this planet before we were shot.
I hate that I have no idea what the names of the bg music are in these videos
Thanks Austin I didn‚Äôt want the existential dread to set in anyway
do one on anthem
Sorry to burst your bubble, but life does not come from nonlife.
We have never once observed life come from nonlife.
So no matter how many amino acids form in primordial soup, there still has to be a supernatural (in the most literal sense of the word) event to start life from nonlife (lightning does not do this).
Which changes these odds from 0.1% to a number so low that any self-respecting mathematician would just round to absolute Zero.
How hot is the nether in MineCraft? And why do the beds explode
I waited for Game Theorists to make one on Subnautica for so long!
Pls take off austin
None of the threats mentioned in his video are as great as the power of big chungus
I think war is our last great filter.
I clicked away at 4.
The worst thing would be meeting or communicating with these civs, you may never know their intentions, it would be just like in older times, when people couldn't communicate with each other because they developed different paths of language. For ones it's "water", for others "wasser", "aqua" or "woda", if not the people who actually thought about learning the language we wouldn't be able to create semi international language (English) to communicate (If I were to speak in my national language (Polish) noone would know my intentions or my attitude, unless somebody knowing the language or website would come in).


Now, what if we would get signal back? What would we get? Message in different language, totally unfamilliar with it. And they don't have google translate nor any insider to learn the language, you cannot communicate to them in English, because they don't even know what England is! The biggest con of even trying to communicate is that in ancient/dark ages, if countries lacked any communication it was only regional onslaught, it wasn't even that bad in overall history, but now, what if the country we as race failed to communicate had much higher tech to actually get to us and declare war because they actually were agressive race? Earth would get demolished, all because we contacted civ that was outsider.


Even sending crypted messages is lil skechy, because, what guarantee we have they will have the same tech to decode it? What if they think it was declaration of war? Better safe than sorry.
Does anyone know the name of the song in the end?
Ima nine year old and when I heard that math thing in the beginning I had no clue what it meant just u se numbers.... that‚Äôs a thing.... right.... |^|
Im a 100% straight but damn your voice is sexy/appealing. I miss you bro. Will you ever make a come-back in lile this ever?? Your rants are and wil always been in my top 5 favorite ranters group. Please dony let the BS forever silence you. I summon you speaker of words. Brainer of brain cells cone to us. Return to our lives with a loving fervor. The world needs your amazing rants.
If we landed on another planet like we did the Moon we would contaminate the planet possibly spreading foreign invaders on to the planet that might destroy to planets ecosystem. We contaminate other parts of Earth every time we visit them. If u use a boat in one lake and then use the same boat in a different lake you have contaminated the other lake. Then when u bring the same boat back to lake 1 from lake 2 you contaminate lake 1. If we can do damage just by using the same boat in different lakes just think how much damage we can do to another planet. We have because of the equipment we bring to Mars probably contaminated Mars. If that equipment comes back to Earth from Mars it will contaminate Earth. Think about how much contamination happens in Star Trek or Star Wars Or The Orville. They are continually contaminated planets and not worrying about what the consequences could be.
When you plant a garden with plants that are not native to the area u are risking the life of plant as well as the lives of native plants and the lives of native animals
OUTRO MUSIC NAME PLEASE
0:42 wow he actually called that out
humanity will destroy this planet, not aliens or anything space related.
Just an idea for a new video( possibly a new channel starter), what if the reason babies cry, is because they lost their memories at birth?
I think it is also important to remember that our galaxy is but one of BILLIONS of other galaxies. Statistically, it should be IMPOSSIBLE that we are the only intelligent life in the entirety of the universe. Whether or not we will ever meet others out there, that is a whole different story.
Nice, a subnautica theory, I love this game
It was fortnight and now it is hytale.
for a second i thought i was watching cosmos
Where's Mat
Drake has his own equation lmao
The problem with all of this talk, even with the filters astronomers have discovered around 200 billion stars and every single one is gonna be bound to have at least one astronomical body orbiting it. A good estimate is saying that every star has anywhere between 0-20 astronomical bodies orbiting them, and the same things that allow life on Earth aren't necessarily required for different types of life considering that life mutates based off of it's environment. Frankly speaking the probability of the Earth being the only planet in this galaxy capable of supporting life would be around 1/1 trillion. It's an astronomical improbability to assume that life doesn't exist elsewhere in this galaxy.

Hi Matt,


I am big fan of you and I wish you would make a video on the current Poodeepee v/s T Series. I expect that you would notice that while you and other Youtubers are making relevant content and not just reviewing memes but researching and analyzing millions of things to make a video, someone else is continuously gaining subscribers not by making good content, but by begging for subscribers and it is rather shameful and demotivating that other top Youtubers are supporting this unnecessary competition and please also take up on the issue of RACISM behind this situation and the RACIST face of that top Youtuber. I really have high hopes from you Matt. Only if the top Youtubers would have given competition to T Series by coming together to make even more awesome and intellectual content, this situation would have been truly won by content creators even if the numbers did not support them. Remember ROCKY, it's not the numbers that count and not the award a win is when you are people's winner. You are the only one who can take a brave stand on this situation and present honest unbiased and practical review of the current situation.
matpat do a vidio on autodale plz
HEY, IT'S HIM! AUSTIN!
FINALLY A SUBNAUTICA THEORY VIDEO
PLEASE DO A FILM THEORY ON MANIFEST PLEASSSEEE
My brain.
Never tell me the odds
Who is trying to come back to this video one million years later?
AHHHH! What is that damn outro song?
2:53 um Austin that's not simple
3:06 theirs something about this line that is so interesting and so cool!!
I think humanity's last filter is applying a machine-like goverment  over itself. All human based governance is partial, and ambiguous, so they generate conflict between large group of people. Which leads to war, which leads to extinction when the weapons exceed a level of destructive power.
An AI can minimize the "victims" of a harsh decision and allocate compensation/solution according to it before tragic things could happen. A human goverment meanwhile would waste the money and time in bureaucracy, radicalize the victims with it, spend the compensation to their parties due to corruption, then dehumanize the victims so people can be sent to shoot them down without empathy.
i love kurzgezagt
Well, that was fun.  Time to go back to learning how to make ENNs and Robots :)
Peach is still dead yall.
What's the song in the outro?
l i have both games
those voice cracks though
The aliens didn't respond because your phone was on airplane mode
I felt depressed before I watch this video and now, I don't know why, I don't feel any better...
Whats the things at 7:14 to 7:20 i haven't seen that before in game
That was a nice ending. I liked it.
Geez
The only way i see to humanity survives our great predators, the microbes ( virus, bacteria, whatever) is to gradually merge ourselves with tecnologie, first with bionic parts, then artificial organs, and finally transfer our conscience to robot bodies
Still.... Kurzgesagt gave more of an existential crisis to me than this... and supposing and assuming are just one thing... we need to find what we can't see first to reach that great filter and make a greater species happen
Literally nothing about subnatica
I believe in ghosts so my friend won't leave me alone he will never leave my side he will go three a nuke to keep my sole close to his and that's what puts me to bet at not also HAVE FUN WITH YOUR EMO-TO-BE SON
Wow. My favorite game is on Game Theory? Nice, I got the Subnautica free, the Below Zero I bought in the first week of launch.
DO MORTAL KOMBAT 11
Kurzgesagt is pronounced k ärtsgeÀàza:gt (Courts kesakd) The k's in kesakt are very soft and the e is... Sorry, our German e hasn't really got anything comparable in English. But our E is amazing anyway, i promise!
I love kerzagat
We better be going extinct
Im sorry but who learned that equation in 6th grade?
so...what your saying is that thanos is just a filter in the DC universe
My brain hurts
0:50 creepy alert that alone made me want to leave
This is an amazing theory. Absolutely love it. There is one other alternative possibility though. We treat technology as limitless, like anything can be done as soon as we discover how. However, it would be reasonable to assume that there is a limit to how far technology can go. It is conceivable that intergalactic travel is not doable or requires such cost and sacrifice that it isn't worth it. There are many reasons there could be aliens out there we haven't encountered. This is a good potential theory. It is not the only explanation though.
Dear Austin, 

I loved your video about Mario's ability to break the bricks, but I noticed a few things wrong with it. 

1. You didn't explain HOW ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING this would be to Mario's body. 

2. Look up this level on YouTube, and I think you'll see. 

SMB3 4-1.
This is a theory right?
All right I'm shouting. I'm shouting. I'm shouting. I'm shouting.
That's just about it.
2:54 simple right?
I think the Drake Equation is just a part of GODS PLAN 
AM I RIGHT?! HAHAHAH.... HA... Ha.. 
Sorry.
"We have discovered no hint, no residue, no archaelogical or astronomical clue that could confirm the existence of a Brahman civilization. The very notion of a mythical progenitor species is a hoary cliche.

Yet our own coexistence with the Vasudans, and our knowledge of the extent of Ancient xenocide, summons a powerful mystery. Technologically sophisticated life is apparently common in the galaxy - it arises frequently, and it has done so for some time now, at least in the cosmological span. Why, then, is the galaxy empty? Why do we find no von Neumann probes propagating through the subspace network? Where is the life that must have come before us?

We should inhabit a teeming universe, a bazaar of wonders, a cosmic ecumenopolis overflowing with civilization. The stars and galaxies around us should by all rights have been restructured to the needs of unimaginably sophisticated engineers. Technology self-catalyzes, and that catalysis has had time to flourish. The civilizations of the universe should, by now, have conquered reality itself.

Yet we find no such wonder. Our cosmos is silent.

Certainly the Shivans provide one answer to this question - a great filter that annihilates spacefaring civilizations. But what if there was a time before the Shivans? What happened to the first life in the universe, the children of the dawn?

Did they pass on to some unglimpsable destiny, leaving no wreckage or monument? Or do we inhabit their tomb - a quarantine zone, a carcass, malignant with some ancient mistake?"
         
In the end humans are probably gonna kill themselves honestly
Is Sega extinct?

Jk
Only on Game Theory could I be fascinated by something I already thought I knew.
Do one on dark deception
WOOOOOOW
This got me scared i hope i die of old age before the sun explodes 0-
with the whole fermi paradox thing, there is, in theory, the chance that we are A the only civilisation using our methods B the only civilisation that cares or C the only civilisation with advanced enough technology for long enough
We will soon because of me and my amazing rockets
I don‚Äôt know what to be confused about first.....
I ALWAYS KNEW MATH WOULD BE THE DEATH OF ME GODDANG
ever hear of the serie  ,,,,ancient aliens on history channnel provf
I so used to u screaming more
The real great filter is the heat death/the universe turning into nothing but pure darkness. 


There is no way we are surviving that without some timelord tier extradimensional technologies.


And even they got great filtered!
üëèüëèüëè
JESUS, AUSTIN.
12:15 never tell me the odds!
This made me sad
I think a lot of things are proving the future extinction of humans
Fk austin
sryy as soon as i heard spoilers i LEFT i hate spoilers
BREAKING NEWS!!!! reggie over from nintendo is now officialy retireing as of april 15!!! He will be replaced by some dude named doug bowser So matpat ya better hurry up and make one last deadlock with reggie
I know this is late and all and I know it doesn't involve game theory. However, you should make a channel like this but on film theory. Because honestly I was just watching an episode of NARUTO, and when rock Lee drops those weights to fight gaara in the chuninin exams. They explode when they hit the ground so I'm wondering just how heavy those things are and the effects it has on the human body.
What was the intense battle song playing in the background?
Inteligence isnt common, proof: anti-vaxxers
This is a prequel to natural selection.
Salad fingers?
I remember learning in biology class that every other form of life that we've studied that has found a way to alter its environment to "guarantee" survival (not via intelligence, of course) shows a pattern: something always comes along and ends it.  And with the state of our environment right now, well, let's just say our Great Filter is closer than we'd like to think.
Shazam couldn‚Äôt tell me what the outro song is, halp.
Who would have thougt thar an equation can solve death time itself
Shane dawson conspiracy theories get on this
why have you not credited the artist who produced your ending song?
4:58 Yelling again, Austin?
Even if we don‚Äôt kill ourselves or get stuck by a meteor or something, the sun will kill us
Im SCRD!
yo he sounds like hobo johnson
Last time I saw him he was a teen
Get back to your own channle
Make a video about Kerbal Space Program.
what was the outro song
Well... that was... dark to say the least... I still cant wrap my head around the fact that there are people who don‚Äôt believe in global warming I hate people like that
FINISH PETSCOP
13:25  THE REASON YOU CLICKED THE VIDEO
ok. are you ever going to do an update on the ‚Äúnew doki doki game‚Äù? Because to me it seems like that wont be happening...
So are we talking about subnautica or real life
Oh I love this game
yes
9:27 never tell me the odds
The human race is doomed in any case because we are a brutal, lazy, omnivore, highly intelligent species that reproduces like jack rabbits and with our expanded life unlike our predecessors, over population/starvation is just around the corner. All we can do is try and teach our children to fix the problems that our generation started. But with the mass amount of technology nowadays and the change of how we humans survive, we as a species are slowly forgetting the bigger picture and claiming facts that are helping us survive like vaccinations, and global warming are untrue. 


Hello to the 2% of people reading this! I hope you have a wonderful existence and thank you for reading my elongated rant.
theres acctually a 0% chance of surviving if we cant make immortal potions yet cause we will all die3...
Are we really going to assume that  aliens want to contact us? Maybe we're that planet
Where is matpat
Thanos is the problem
I've got to say I'm unimpressed, to me, someone who knows a lot about this concept it all makes sense but I get the feeling you don't quite explain it enough. Like, you simply state that "the existence of intelligent life means the great filter is likely ahead of us." Well why is that? I know why but the innerworkings of it aren't explained and thus the video seems... bare. Especially with that super hype intro. And heck earlier in the video the you say that they don't find life often or this is the first time they have. But then later your point is "if it's this common." what? Humans have probably traveled to hundreds of world. Just because I reach my hand into a jar full of colored spheres and 1/10000000 is red. If I reach into it hundreds of times and early on hit the red, that doesn't mean there are a lot of reds.
You know, a lot of this talk about human extinction and all that makes me think of Ark: Survival Evolved. It's not the biggest game, but the lore is SO GOOD. I recommend you guys take a gander at the game and see if you guys can figure anything else from it.
I was just waiting for a drake joke ever since I heard the last name drake
WHERES MATPAT??!!!!
join ancient aliens on history
I never clicked so fast...
1:01 That's legit... All Jacksepticeye.
Yeah the hole Humanity going extinct thing may a really BIG fallback ( like 99% of Humanity dying ) has a high chance like 99.9% but completly going extinct not so much
I don't know why I come here anymore
what's the song at the end?
In short form...




We're screwed.
Aaaaand now Im paranoid...
WHERE IS MATPAT
Isn't it 50% not .1% that we survive the next filter? .1% chance life passes all the filters.
Is that a gun?
YAYYYY!!! FINALLY AUSTIN IS BACK!!!!!!!
Man i got a head ache from this xD ... can you make it simple ? please
Omg make a theory about granny mat pat
If the best case is that extra-terrestrial life doesn't exist, why don't we make our own 'aliens'?
It's a game
So while I get the point of this video, something not being accounted for is that finding intelligent life elsewhere doesn't actually mean that the great filter is still ahead of us;  if we suddenly found another 40 species, there might be an issue, but even with the conservative estimates, we should find one or two that have passed the great filter, same as us (if we are passed it.)

The other thing to consider is that, comparatively, we're in the young stages of the universe.  Think of the time it takes galaxies and stars, planets, then life to form, and we are in the first 10% that could have possibly formed.  If we assume life is common, but intelligent life isn't... well, anyone else out there might just not be old enough for us to see them yet.
Of course mat can't talk about this
... I watched this on my lunch break. Fuq
Sooo... The only thing that matters is that it happens after I die gotcha I understand ;)
The precursors aren't definitely extinct. The disease did wipe some planets, but that doesn't mean it wiped all planets. 4546B is in quarantine, and it's possible, even likely, that the precursors did manage to quarantine the disease to a degree where they could cut their losses and discard contaminated planets and go on with their lives elsewhere. After all, your dinky little handheld scanner could pick it up pretty much immediately, so a super advanced civilisation could definitely detect and eradicate with force if not medicine.
Yeah‚Ä¶ Technological singularities are pretty risky. But with great risk, comes great reward.

I think there's a not insignificant risk of life becoming too ‚Ä¶ not comfortable, but ‚Ä¶ too distracting, for too large a percentage of the population. And of course there's global warming, which may jiggle something dangerous loose in the ecosystem.
where is mattpat
What is the name of the song at the end of the video? I really like it, but not sure how to find it.
Or it's just some fish
i have a question for everyone here... if the earth is round and we are round but the floor is flat dose the mean the
 earth is flat but we see it round or, 
is the floor round and everyone in the world is wrong when they say its flat? Then dose that mean the word "flat"should be eliminated from the dictionary?

[reread several times to completely understand the question, also ask your friends and family this question]
Think about your answer wisely... (commit for your answer)
Ill just go ahead and say that all our assumptions about matter, physics, life, intelligence and how these things are supposed to be formed are based on our limited understanding of existence. The next paradigm shift might change all of that, as much as realizing that the earth is round (sorry guys) changed everything. By now we realized that there are way more things than we can observe or calculate which makes it impossible to say where we are going to end up. The next discovery might change our perspective so much that the next great filter seems like an easy step and wont even be noticed. Sure, we're still going to kill ourselves because we are stupid monkeys. But before we get to that theres a ton of stuff to learn.
I really need to know what's the name for the outro song. @thegametheorists
dont listen to Austin he is going to murder ur brain
Who is Tania?
Who learns that equation in sixth grade
Hey guys! Welcome to another really deep episode with Austin! Today we will be redefining the universe a third time while simotanously blowing your mind!
13:12 ... I mean he is right... but why tell ur child this?
5:29 I think he‚Äôs gonna talk about the alien like creatures in subnatica
What is the song at the end called?
where is matpat
My favourite equation, rfpnifififcl
Lol am in 6th grade
Not to be rude or anything, but this sounds like a conspiracy theory.
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things! PEOPLE KEEP PROVING WERE GOING EXTINCT!!!! ITS BEEN GOOD FOR FAR TO LONG! I feel like the great filter will be starvation or nuclear war
In conclusion...plague inc. Is real?...austin u cant be serious..
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD HANDS OFF MY MACARONI, PASTA BANDIT HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD
HE WAS PICKING UP THE GUN WITH HIS FINGER AND HIS THUMB POINTED STRAIT AT HIS FOREHEAD
Yes i am
What did this have to do with subnatca
We will all die anyway
I Just COme FOr Matt
YES! A SUBNAUTICA "theory"! I've been wanting a theory on subnautica for over a year now, and below zero is pretty cool too.  I have some questions I want answered about the base game, though. 
1. If nearly the entire planet was covered in in carar, and has been for several thousand years, how is it possible that no aquatic organisms are immune to it?


2. can you really partially refill your o2 tank with a brain coral bubble?


3. Could a prawn suit even get off the sea floor with its jets?
You should write a Lovecraftian horror novel about this
I'm g 5
The conclusion is wrong because that 0.1% is all of the Great filters combined - most of which humanity has already passed with Populate Star System and Populate Galaxy left.  At 50% each this results in a 25% that we will populate the galaxy.  When people do theories like this i really wish they understood how statistics work.
2:53 simple huh
Yay, another existential crisis! :D
EPIC
@12:10 Austin says 'the chance of humanity surviving the next great hurdle is .1%'. This is flawed in that when he introduces the great filter, he says it claims each section of the filter is a 50% chance leading to a .1% chance.
Really wanted mat pat but ill take it
Soo is this why you do not have a real job...
Does the paradox take into account conciouness.
From my persional experience i want to know what is outside our solar system but thats pobably not the case for other spicies example cats they dont give a crap about what is outside... my point is they probably dont make contact because they dont wonder whats outside their home they are just trying to survive.
where is our MatPat?
I never understood the great filters, why does an animal go extinct just because it doesnt develope?
Yo there‚Äôs no spoilers?
Love that at 1:00 he used jacksepticeye to show subnuatica
So......this episode was just an existential crisis in disguise? Yawn....I came for mind breaking numbers and science, not hypothetical calculations based on numbers that are random guesses at best plugged into a math formula.
Please not Austin again
Sub 2 waffle galaxy
Sub 2 waffle galaxy
how is anyone supposed to understand the SIBO message? let alone other intelligent species that likely don't have the same languages we have
I always love a good drake/fermi/great filter video! And I‚Äôll say what i always do...i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre alone in the universe, were alone in distance and time. Human have been on the scene for a blink of an eye. A thousand galaxy spanning civilizations could have risen and gone extinct in the time it took for us to crawl out of the trees and start planting crops. We were hunter-gathers for a HUNDRED THOUSANDS YEARS. We may find as we explore the galaxy the ancient ruins of all those that came before us, and we may find those protobeings that follow us. Or say we never discover FTL travel and were stuck to our solar system and a smattering of close stars. There could be someone just like us on the other end of the milkway sending signals right at us but we could miss each other by 50,000 years. The universe is already ancient, Time is deep and our hopes of finding someone out there can‚Äôt accurately comprehend the timescales were working with here.
Your implying that intelligence is like a lego, you stack it high enough it will fall down
Actually... the precursors still exist but they left the planet and put it under quarantine you need to play the frickin game to actually understand the story austin, global warming ldoesnt exist, it's stupid
How much wait need to which browser with 3 jumps
Is someone remember that matpat was sponsored by tik tok last video?
pls do the forest
Great Filters aren't all that valid.
We could simply be one of the first. I mean, look at how young the universe is. On an astronomical scale, the universe only just:
1. Cooled Down.
2. Formed star systems with enough resource diversity.

Even now we're pushing it with resource diversity. We do not have a lot of resources that'd make our lives here on Earth and beyond easier.
so that 0.1% chance, is that for the species or the individual, because cutting the population to 7 with a B to 7 with an M probably not a bad thing when looking at populations (killing off 999 out of every 1000 notwithstanding)
This paradox is becoming outdated. As we discovering more about our universe, we learn sustaining life is virtually impossible for instance originally there is thought to be three things a planet needed to sustain life now there are almost 300 and more are added every month. And this isn't even the only example, things like DNA/RNA are turning out to be more complicated than we could have imagined. If we had a slightly higher or lower percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere we would all die. So there's no need to fear about a mass extinction event until we find evidence of it. (whith alien life)
Outro Song?
Of course we're still in the middle of our universal crisis, do you see what we do to our own planet and our own people? I can't see us conquering any other planets or even a galaxy if we barely have control of ourselves or  our planet and its inhabitants. So until we can truly find a way to be unified without hurting anyone or their free will, and until humans choose to do things for the benefit of our race and our home planet we won't be residing on any planets anywhere outside of our stratosphere
OK Time for bed
College, high school HAH never heard of it
I love this game!!!!!!!!
This was an actually good episode
Song at the end?
Umm....
I disagree with the great filter theory mostly because there are undoubtedly forms of life that exist outside of our understanding of what has to happen to create life. And sexual reproduction may be necessary to create a good gene pool, but asexual reproduction is just as legitimate. There are lizards that can clone themselves after all. So it‚Äôs a very interesting thought, but intelligent life as we understand it is just one of many possible processes that could occur.
U mean to in a nutshell
All things must return to Sithis eventually..
In 1950, at Los Alamos, a scientist was talking with his friends
And the conversation had them all fully engrossed
About this universe that almost has no ends
And as they were all about to return to their study
Enrico suddenly shouted "Where is everybody?"
And he worked out a few simple calculations
That indicated we should have been visited thousands of times
At least, based on his estimations
(chrous)
Oh, that's the Fermi Paradox
If they're out there, why don't we hear 'em talk?
The galaxy just keeps on spinnin'
With four hundred billion stars in it
And I just can't believe that we could be unique
When there's so much space in this galaxy
Oh, I want Pandora's Box
To be open, but instead we're stuck in Fermi's Paradox
There are dozens of ways this paradox might be resolved
And you probably can think of some yourself
Maybe civilizations very rarely evolves
Or maybe god sent them all to hell
Or maybe advanced technology leads to its own destruction
Or maybe species lose interest in reproduction
Or maybe they're just afraid of what we'll do when we find out
So, they're hiding until we grow a bit and don't have the same tendency to frequently freak out

(second chorus)
Oh, that's the Fermi Paradox
If they're out there, why don't they talk?
The galaxy just keeps on spinnin'
With four hundred billion stars in it
And I just can't believe that we could be unique
When there's so much space in this galaxy
Oh, I want Pandora's Box
To be open, but instead we're stuck in Fermi's Paradox
Oh, the question of whether there is more life out there
As far as I'm concerned, is moot
But it appears that the aliens do not use Foursquare
And, no, I'm not trying to be cute
Because the way that we listen is defined by our ears
And the time that we've been listening just a couple dozen years
We'll be lucky when we see them if we notice them at all
Our cosmic phone could be ringing off the hook right now, and we're just not answering the call

(second chorus)
Oh, yeah, we're stuck in Fermi's Paradox
Oh, no, we're stuck in Fermi's Paradox
Oh, no, we're stuck in Fermi's Parado
I'm more scared of spoilers. Watch Later it is then
why is GT not in the fight yet?
Pewds vs T-series
Sally face video plz
I honestly think you could've come up with a bunch more relevant theories. Like, a better theory idea would be to theorize what lies beyond the crater Subnautica takes place in and how and why an environment could only sustain leviathans and microorganisms. 

Or how about what kind of environmental conditions it would take to sustain a creature the size of the gigantic skeleton underground in subnautica (the one that's bigger than a Leviathan class super predator that supposedly you can only see about a third of the whole skeleton).

Or how about why there's only a handful of cuddlefish in the whole game and why they're all in permanent stasis until you let them out.

Or maybe how is it that this hatching enzyme needed to hatch a sea emperor could ever be synthesized naturally to hatch the eggs without human action, if it requires collecting and combining plant life from each biome. 

Honestly, when I saw the thumbnail, I assumed you meant the bacterium killing everyone since enzyme 42 was only reported to "fight the symptoms into remission" rather than outright cure it, meaning that diver man is still carrying the bacterium and that the bacterium is still out in the waters. And thus, diver man's symptoms will probably return. Even if it did kill the bacterium he already had in him, it's still in the water and will thus infect him after that point on his way to the rocket. Which is also supported by the fact that even though all the peepers were carrying it out to open waters, the bacterium was still returning over and over again. I was somewhat disappointed.
Anyone else find it oddly comforting, or I guess a better word is fitting, that humanity will one day fade back into the void? To Oblivion? Whether or not we die with our planet or wind up taking it down with us, who knows.
üëç
i dislike like these illogical pseudo science videos, cease this, humans, this mess does not amuse me as it once did, but it will clean itself up in time, so in hopes of speeding up this clean up time a little bit, and maybe helping you and others in the process, but here i go:

Universes Aren't created, for a lack of more elaborate and deeper wording, they just exist, they are beyond the immune to the concepts and effects of age, life, birth, death, size, mass, shape, form, edge, beginning, end, center, and are essentially infinite in all ways, in other words, you will never hit a point in travel,where you will ever hit an edge/end to the universe, you will never hit a point where it loops back to where you were, as it is not flat, nor a sphere, nor a shape with a radius.

Time, Space, Nature, Energy, just like the universe are infinite in amount/abundance and existence, as they are essentially what allows our universe to exist, if any one of those traits were not infinite, we simply would not exist, as this universe would fail to exist, which we mean we would never exist, you cant exist existence, if existence does not exist, and existence cannot create itself as it doesn't exist, to create itself, see the problem there? that in an of itself is a paradox, you know what fixes that paradox, Infinity, the fact that keeps constantly being pushed aside by humans who are too overwhelmed by both its complexity and simplicity, its straight forwardness and non-existent paradoxes.

the only things that exist within the universe, and exist within the effects of time, space, nature, and energy, are the things that manifest within it all, in other words, life, elements, compounds, matrixi (energy types/forms), Celestial bodies, creatures, people, ect ect.

Additionally, Habitation/habitability, is an infinite perceptual, to us, trying to exists in a a sun, would turn us to instant ash, to others, a sun would be room temperature/normal, to us, what feels like room temperature, to them, would be beyond flash freezing, instant shattering frozen death, to us, what feels like skin melting painful acid rains, and 6x gravity with no sun exposure, would be their version of either rain, or "normal" weather, and their habitation, to us, what feels like the vacuum of space, to others  would feel like normal atmospheric pressure, to us, what feels like unbreakable or non-existent gas, to others would feel like a breath of fresh air, to us, mouths are normal, oral consumption of bio matter would be the normal way of providing nutrients to the body, while for others, collecting space dust, solar energy, and radiation via collection through Xeno scales and pores and tentacles would be their normal way of providing nutrients to their body, to us what freezes us instantly, to others would be normal temperature, to us, what is room temperature, is to them, becoming engulfed in burns, fires, and death, as to them, it would feel molten hot.

Life comes in many forms, and is not limited to DNA and RNA, those are just part of what can exist and what could manifest.

not all life, uses sexual reproduction to reproduce, and not all life uses fertilization as reproduction either, it the same as DNA and RNA is just part of what life could use.

and as far as single cell, multi cell, bigger multi cell, tool using animals, current civilization, and populating star systems and galaxies goes, that is essentially not restricted to anything or anywhere.

but alas, you will learn, and you will all see what i mean, in time, my spirit, undying and eternal, will be around and about, to see you when you do, i will leave it at that, cya friends and loves and amazing people.
I can sleep happy after watching that
13:26 aww da pengualiens
In mortal kombat 9. When did raiden go back in time
Ahem what
New title:why are there no aliens
So long and thanks for all the fish
I like to think that intelligence is very common and almost all aliens passed the filters but we're too underdeveloped to communicate with them because we're a special case.
God is tired of us
Someone FINALLY thinks like me. I think that intelligence is overrated!
What is that song at the end
Notification squad?
So... you're saying there's a chance?
Hey Austin/Mattpat can you make a video explaining ubercharge in tf2 because it‚Äôs quite confusing how it can make you invincible just with a laser beam. That would be really cool.
Hi
What an ending.
What was the song at the end? Dear Jesus with an Afro that was a funky jam
I'm in 3rd grade though.. does that mean I don't know this? Multiplication üòï = 2√ó5=10
The answer of "where are they?" could be answered with "where are we?". We have had ample opportunities to leave earth, but only a fraction of the entire human population has ever escaped earths gravity. We are slow at exploring and space is infinite, even the large possible number of alien space-faring races have a huge chance of exploring away from our galaxy.
What an amazing video...
I really don't know what is so bad with being dead or not living!
Me: Sees R* ".....Oh god, please don't".
Video: Drake equation slowly unfurls
Me: "Well, it's not like invoking the Drake equation has ever gone wrong for anyone on the internet....."
I HATE AUSTIN
what is sentshent?
The problem about the Drake equation is that we don't have the data to estimate the probabilities of any kind of life forming. It's like throwing a dice once, getting a 6 (life) and saying that the probability for that must have been 1 in x. Until we find another form of life on another planet, we can simply not say anything about the probability (the first point that I'd be comfortable with estimating probabilities is when we have found like 10-100 life forms that evolved indepentent from each other).
Finally
This gets potentially worse when you scan all the items in display cases in the game: it seems pretty likely that the Precursors visited other alien species that were developing intelligence.  We know they visited Earth, as there is a blade with a description that says it is not only from Earth, but has trace amounts of genetic material from one of Earth's historical leaders, I believe members of a Chinese dynasty.
WHAT.
Oof bad time
Way is matpat
Than it is the job of all of humanity to pass that great filter if it is ahead of us.
I actually hate Austin more than anyone... no joke
Those voice cracks are harsher than the ones on my phone
matpat must do a theory on the multiple stories going on in ICEY
there's the story on the surface, a lovecraftian tale, a tale of self-aware artificial intelligence, a tale of cyborg clones that are kiled over and over in pursuit of some twisted experiments, and a tale of a failed game developer who is quite possibly insane.
I havre a feeling all the different stories are connected somehow, like maybe the same story, but told in different ways from different perspectives.
I'd like matthew patrick to take a closer look at it all.
Dear Austin:

I have spent a little time looking at the research behind a gem I actually learned about from your old ShoddyCast video regarding super mutants in the fallout universe.  (I recommended checking out the entirety of The Science playlist if anyone hasn't)

The research is intriguing to me. The problem is, as a layperson, a plebe if you will, all these genetic words are like Greek to me. I don't understand Greek if that wasn't obvious. Since Matpat gets to go on tangents not video game related from time to time, I was wondering if you would be interested in doing a lecture style video (preferably in ShoddyCast style) that covers CRISPR more in depth.  Matpat should have minimal problem with this as this is a science that should be more transparent and available to the general public.

My three questions regarding CRISPR are as follows:

1) Would it be possible to use CRISPR to eradicate disease from the human genome?

2) What are the downsides, if any, of using CRISPR in medicine?

3) Is it possible to extract CRISPR from an organism if, say, you wanted to destroy leukemia? ( i.e: use CRISPR to destroy the bad marrow then remove it so it doesn't destroy the good marrow)?

I do hope you'll take up this request. Scholarly papers don't translate well to the layperson. TracrRNA, CRISPR-cas9 and crDNA just confuse the hell out of me.

R*f_p*N_e*f_l*f_i*f_c*L*B_s. B_s means "the amount of bullsh*t your willing to buy from Drake.
Jeez... The universe is scary if you don‚Äôt have any religious beliefs!
The precursors are not from planet 4546b, so you are not correct.
K. These great filters are only for life that evolved in a similar manner to ourselves. What if there are lifeforms out there so vastly different they have the ability to evolve to live in any environment within their own lifespan. What if those types of life dont need intelligence to end up travelling in space. It's a natural ability. That's just one of the potential nearly infinite ways to get past filters we've described. Humans aren't really that intelligent on a universal scale.
Biggest thing you‚Äôre missing, a sufficiently advanced space faring race might not want to leave a trace of their explorations. Perhaps, they use nano technology. They‚Äôve tuned their technology and energy efficiency to the scale of micro meters. 

You‚Äôre assessment of the Fermi paradox is elementary, at best. Sorry.
Austin. Hey Austin! AUSTIN, GET YOUR 15TH COFFEE BUCKET!
This is a 'what if', but what if... 'life' isn't 'life' in other species? What if, life, as we explain it, is completely different from how other species understand their form of life? Everything on Earth must've been a mutation of the universe, and that we weren't supposed to exist. This might prove the Great Filter wrong. What if... there is life everywhere. Not in the way we see it. Dark matter? Still unknown, but it may be harboring life in a different way: Nano-life. Or even radio-wave life. Because as far as we know, the Earth is the only living thing out in the Milky Way, but it's the same chance as passing through the Great Filter. It's a point 1 percent chance of passing the Great Filter, but there's also point 1 percent chance of seeing anything of everything we know outside space. Basically, if we know life, it's a point 1 percent chance of seeing another life from our view because it's SO DIFFERENT to us. If this gets featured, I want the world to remember me through history as Harokou Jishou.
WHERE IS MATT?!?!?!
2:09pm 2/19/19 i commented the other stuff
Why did you change ur face?
Wait you got a kid?
Austin is the only reason I come back to game theory. SO LESS OR MATPAT AND MORE OF AUSTIN!
But humans in subnautica have already passed the intergalactic space filter as they have ships like the Aurora to explore the galaxy. So humans are safe as they have spread across the universe and even if a  virus had affected a ship it will take a long time for the ship to reach any  human settlements as nothing can travel faster than light. So humans might be doomed if we invent faster than light travel.
Where is matpat
Could say the same thing about most games with aliens in them really. Pretty disappointing video...
DAN SALVATO IS SCOTT CAUTHON WHO IS MATPAT WHO IS ACTUALLY AUSTIN
Anybody else or is it just me that I forgot that this video was even about subnautica and he explained to much of the Drake equation so I forgot this video was even about subnautica and thinking it was some space video I found, it surprised me a bit when he mentioned subnautica a bit through the video, thinking this was not a vid about subnautica
Finally a Subnautica theory!!!
Just like that .1% chance that the advengers would defeat thanos and they didn‚Äôt so were probably gonna die
I know people love to laugh at religious people for being "backwards" or "ignorant", but every time I see the numbers for stuff like what Austin showed to explain Great Filters and see just ridiculously unlikely it is for us to have made it to this point in our existence according to all widely-accepted scientific theories about the origin of life and our universe, I find it more and more impossible to believe that there isn't some greater power that allowed us to even exist (much less grow and progress into the civilizations we have today).


It's like exploding a pile of bricks and expecting them all to land in the shape of a house: sure, it may  be possible, but only by a margin too insanely small to be considered feasible. If we  got all the right dice rolls to have made it this far as a species when everything else on this planet hasn't, imagine how difficult it'll be for some alien race to even  to the point where it can find us...
What was the song at the end?
Doesn't all the Drake equation actually prove that there is one life supporting planet that can communicate with itself? It seems presumptuous to believe that all potential life would adhere to Earth's style.
Guys, did you know? Fun fact!
He has a child. I don't think you knew that.
It's not like he points that out in every single video.
The there‚Äôs this...if their are others out there, it‚Äôs either that those civilizations are more advanced, or WE are more advanced...
nah, life is just abundant in the universe we are just not looking in the right places at the right time. Probably Life started on Mars and then a Asteroid hits mars and since mars only has 1% of atmosphere of earth a chunk of the rock from mars flies through the solar system and hits earth and life starts from micro organisms :)
This was an informative video, but it had nothing to do with Subnautica aside from dropping a few names. You didn't mention any dialogue or clues from the game that would even bring someone to the conclusion that humanity is going extinct. It was just a video describing the Fermi paradox and giving some examples of great filters, and then saying "This is what's happening in Subnautica" without any actual evidence other than "there's an alien disease and a lost civilization on this planet".
What happened to matpat
Normal people upon watching this video: crippling existential crisis
Me: Yeah, this is a normal tuesday.
Do want aliens though? Well kill one another with sicknesses because our systems would never have learned to fight of that disease
I love that channel
I know I‚Äôll never ever see a great filter in my lifetime but the fact that we have a challenge like that to overcome makes me excited somehow
Ah terrifying on a cosmic and existential scale. My favorite type of fear
Edit: I WANT CAT
Ooh. Great barriers and the Drake equation! I did actually learn this in 6th grade, funnily enough!
I can't find the song by its lyrics at all : (

(Oh, Say Goodbye)
She said I never want you back.
Don't need you back.
Don't need a life like that.
(Say Goodbye)
If I did I'd be the fool.
(Say Goodbye)
Oooooooo
TL:DW
Great Filters = Apocalyptic Events
The day before I read an article on the Fermi paradox for English and today I had to answer questions my teacher gave me on it. This video helped me get through that as well as remember what I read
I am so happy that I knew what the drake equation was before he said it like my astronomy teacher would be proud.
INVASION OF THE ZIM SCIENCE!! YEEEEES!!
At 12:10
Who else saw those holes and got thief tripophobia activated
Kurzgesagt is awesome and so is game theory
great parenting 10/10
This video was awesome! I loved the music being used and all the edits you guys did
Thanks YouTube for recommending this video to me so I can have a panic attack just by looking at the thumbnail.
...why did Drake not accept that one of those variables may be 0?
Can you please credit the music you use?
Awesome vid, Austin!
2:20
‚ÄúWhen the sun exploded and erased our...‚Äù low mass stars like the sun don‚Äôt explode necessarily. They actually just...‚Äùpuff off‚Äù their outer layers in a dramatic attempt to stay alive, in other words pressure wins out against gravity and the outer layers are released. Then it created a beautiful (hopefully beautiful) planetary nebula.
That was the best one yet thank you
Yes subnatica finnalley
Game theater i follow u on tip top
All that coffee is bad for you, just do a line or two next time.
What is the science of slugs from Slugterra
Arthur C. Clarke wrote about this in his last book of a series titled Rama Revealed.. many many years ago. So I‚Äôve basically assumed this was the case for most of my life.
Can you do how strong is Larry lobster? ü§£
Did this have anything to do with Subnautica?
Nvm
Yesssssss   Two of my favorite thing.    Game theory and subnautica put together
played super smash flash 2 on Supersmashflash2beta.comm it's great to play it with my family
You need your OWN channel. Sorry but mattpatt doesn't compare too you in terms of hype and accurate estimations/calculations
Make a video about Dr. Mario. The game and the character.
Wouldn't it be possible if life was robotic and outdated
AUSTIN!! YOU ARE BACK!!!
0:13 voice crack lol
What if the solution to the Fermi Paradox is that we are one of the first to be as advanced as we are? What if there is almost no one to talk to . . . yet?
What if aliens can only see/hear certain frequencies that we can‚Äôt, making it impossible to communicate.
Where is everybody? 
I'll let you in on a secret. They don't exist...
90:00:00

THE SCIENCE!!!! Behind how  massive turret can curve massive energy beam shots around the entire planet.
This felt like a movie at first
Yelp that's depressing
just took forever to make this video BUT!!!!!!! I LOVE IT STILL. NEED MORE SCIENCE AUSTIN!!!!!!!!!!.

Ah and whoever these people that made a 2.3k thumbs down. I hope you feel better after your hard day
Thank you for making a Subnautica theory
o my god KURGEZAJAZUT MADE A VIDEO ON THE GREAT BARRIERS
Ah, aren't Austin's episodes the most relaxing?
I'm just glad you're not yelling ... as much ... anymore
Do a theory on how big the torbado is and if it really can lift planes
Hey a spoiler warning, I guess enough people got very upset about Red Dead 2
lets just ignore the fact that this game takes place on another planet
I think you're overlooking the tiny fact that intelligence is one of if not the #1 survival skill of all time. As the most intelligent species on the planet, we have conquered the globe.

One day we will no doubt go extinct. If nothing else, heat death will get us. That does not, however, mean we are going to die right now. We are living in the safest, most peaceful time in human history, and it only seems to be improving. We will be fine.
Dang that‚Äôs deep. Get it cuz subnautica is deep? Lol
God dammit austin
ahhh thats hot
Is now freaking out
Hey can I have games games this is another message from the Creator's daughter I am wanting to tell you a very good secret for my father and this is most of all the hardest secret that you all can do spring-trap is golden Freddy's brother
Every time I click on what I think is a MatPat episode and get... this, I'm filled with disappointment.
I‚Äôm sorry but I skipped this video cause I don‚Äôt want to know when we are all gonna die I already worry too much about stuff like that 
Once again my apologies
12:15 wiw Austin you really don't understand the concept of great filters do you? The 0.1% chance is for a spiecies to get past all the great filters, but there's a significantly better chance of getting through each individual great filter (also it's a BS figure, because to get it you gave every variable a value of 0.5 arbitrarily to gey it).

Seriously boys and girls if you want a better, more indepth explaination of the Fermi Paradox look up Isaac Arthur, he has a whole series on it, that said each video is quite long.
Is it bad that I'm watching this as I'm going to bed
I just wonder. If we actually did stumble on intelligent life out there. What about the communication process? What kind of language they developed? Can we understand it? Can they understand us? What if we said something friendly and kind, yet to them it's offensive? Is there a common ground where we can communicate to each other? Like here on Earth, we have the universal English language where it unites us and help us understand each other. What about space? These questions might be a little silly, but it keeps bugging me..üòÖ
whats the song called in the outro? i really like it!
Five minutes in: ‚Äúmy head hurts‚Äù 
Go Austin
Thanks for the existential-crisis...
I love this sound track
wtf thats what u tell ur children bf they got o sleep
Wasn't there this big news story about how we'd spotted a whole fleet of distinctly artificial-looking structures orbiting in a different star system really far off? What happened to that?
Wow. Just wow.
The Drake equation. U meant the kiki do u luv me equation.
Subnautica seems awesome.
He didn‚Äôt prove anything
No your on an aliens planet earth is still there
This didn't make much sense tbh. I am so sorry. But it didn't.
How do I understand this?
I'M JUST TWELVE YEARS OLD
Oh and the theory
Wait is this true were going to die
I am from austria. and even i think it is hard to spell kurzgesagt lol
I'm guessing MatPat is away because of his son?
I honestly think why we haven't found life on other worlds is because God doesn't want us to find them because of the nature of humans when we find a new untouched world we become imperialist once again.
Kurzgesagt heyyy that¬¥s german
One Simple Equation...[The Drake Equation}
Can someone please tell me the outro name?
Real talk, the Fermi Paradox keeps me up at night.
Matpat, make a video about the most powerful smash characters by CANON
You should make a video about how long humanity would survive if exposed to the crar virus!!!!!
At minute 5 I choked at the fact of a Drake meme representing the Drake equation
Open ups docs "Dear.." 


Me: here we go again.
There‚Äôs a 3rd too, sentient squids are confirmed in a pda in SubZero
Austin? It‚Äôs been years!
[Explicit word]
Game Theory killed Shoddycast.
BIG fan of the new style!
A simple equation.
Astin lol
Theres like 8 of us we aren't going extinct yet
If we have one great filter ahead of us wouldn‚Äôt we have a 50% chance, since gamblers fallacy is a fallacy?
I hate trig !
It's not a expansion it's a sequel
Wow Austin and Subnautica??? Sign me up!
The precursors were not from planet 4546b the planet subnautica takes place on they way you said it makes it sound like the precursors were from the planet the only sentient native species (as much as we know of) on planet 4546b is the sea emperor leviathan
If 2 very different civilizations stuck together and where evolving at the same time and used each others findings to benefit each other.... would that make there be a less amount of filters?
2:31 Is that dandruff on your hair?
5:05 did anybody see the




420( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I'm still waiting for a theory of horizon: zero dawn.
Well that was barely linked to subnautica at all, though it was kind of interesting
O.O he's different without gallons of caffein.
Hey Austin!!! if you enjoy podcasts you should listen to "The end of the world" with josh clark. Its a 10 part series all about existential threats to humanity, the Fermi Paradox, and how we could bring about our own demise. Its pretty cool and its all i could think of as i was watching this video!!
Lets say ive never played a game before. Recommend one(just one) that'll blow my mind. Anyone please
New sub bro hell yeah
I LOVE SUBNATICA YAY
Our next great filter will probably be the end times in the Bible
Arecibo! Puerto Rico represent!
Can you make a thery about the game sea of theives
2:40 when the video starts new record for stalling out time on the channel
Mat Pat learn from this guy
What if there are intelligent species trying to inform us about their existence but, we aren't smart enough to get the actual signal?
Imagine your son watching this when he is order or he is like, daddy what do you do for work and you show him one of your earlier videos on the game theory.
THIS is pretty dumb
3 minutes for an intro no
Loved this video!
Hey... um... so, there were (*pushes up glasses*) a couple of errors in your analysis of the game. First, you said there were two sentient species on the planet, but you are attributing the precursors to the planet when they just came to study and eliminate the disease. Second (albeit related to the first point), you said they were extinct, which there is no evidence of within the game as that wasn't their homeworld and there were no precursor corpses around. Below Zero does add a bit to the lore, but we still don't know who they really are, where they are from or if they still exist.
7:18 did nintendo steal those cube things?
the best part of my life is the fact that i know i am gonna die someday

the worst part of my life was me being born
...
so yay! the end is near!
"simple math problem"
So this video had nothing to do with Below Zero and was only put in the title to draw clicks. Nice!
I just finished a subnautica hardcore run this vid is cool
See, spoiler warnings aren't so hard! Thanks again for ruining the end of rdr 2, btw....
Knowledge is painful
So, you do a bit of flipping between saying that a great filter is an individual step and the whole system of steps. Yes, the probability of getting through all of the steps with probability you proposed is only 0.09% , but from our current place in advancement, two steps from galactic conquest, it's a 25% chance that we will be able to cross the next two barriers successfully. Much less bleak than suggested. Even if this theory is proven true by a universe with a Subnautica like spread of life, it by no means dooms humanity to be extinguished before we reach galactic conquest.

The .1% applies to the process to get there from the beginning of the universe. Seeing as there are a number of potentially habitable planets, the probability of finding other life at a similar stage to our own, by your liberal estimates, is only .78%, which is not great as far as finding a pen pal, so it works with the lack of communicative life.

Anyway, that's my two cents. Regardless of the accuracy, it was an interesting video that taught me a good bit about the theories used to figure out if other life is a thing. 

Have a good one and I hope I didn't ruin your day by pointing out an error that I saw.



(Also can I get a cheer for humanity (ahem... I mean a ton of lucky breaks on evolution's part) for getting us past that < 0.78% likelyhood of being here? (I say < cause the 50% chance of making it is very liberal, as the video mentioned))
Huhhh your voice is beautiful
What if God was just a sentient alien
Ho ho, neat-o
Austin please stop giving me existential crisis's I feel small and worthless anyway!
Make a theory on the scp foundation.. i think they dont make sence
Most of this is multiplying variables that we have very little data, very few datapoints about, along with some very grand assumptions about the inevitability of interstellar travel.

So what I understood was that a great filter is bad and .1% of survival is what we have and that it is bad...
Even more terrifying, the religions might be right according to this.
Enjoyed the video :)! Just started playing subnautica too
they mentioned Kurzgesagt, cool I watch them too much
what if, planets, stars and black holes are just the protons and neutrons and electrons of an atom (galaxy) which are just small particles of a greater living being and the humans, animals and probably aliens are just like microorganism (like bacteria) and the space is just the space between all those atoms? That would change so much in our "known universe" and not only that, we would also know, that space would then not be infinite like we assume... and the expanding of space would mean, that this greater living being is just in growth and has therfore some day, in an yet probably uncountable number, to face an end, what would mean death to every living thing unless we would find a way to expand our being beyond this greater living being...
OH MY GOOODDD I MISSEDD YOUUU üòÇüòÇ
Matpat have you seen the new episode of salad fingers episode 11 ‚Äúglass brother‚Äù
I love how subnautica is relavent again
Austin goes Lovecraft. Love it!
Thanks for reminding me how meaningless we are and that were all gonna die with no purposeüòÇüòÇüòÇyet I still laugh
The worst thing is going into comment section of theory channel and just "read more" onto comment you think would be short.... aand then you regret your decision by the time you reach the end of it üòÇ

yay trending!
I hate to be the kind of person that suggests something in the comments a game request but have you ever heard of the game OFF?? It‚Äôs an early 2000‚Äôs rpg maker game but like to this day nobody knows what‚Äôs going on in this thing, I would really like to know someday and I feel like you could figure it out
woah music? wuuuut
I‚Äôd say this, my very very mundane and novice level theory: Intelligence isn‚Äôt our advantage, it IS our Great Filter. Look at how many of our own problems we cause! Climate Change, War, Weapons of Max Destruction, Drug-Resistant Microbes, AI, and even more! We‚Äôre our own worst nightmare.
You can‚Äôt judge the amount of life on subnortica because maybe life may just be rare after all look at how long it took intellect humans to evolve compared to early evolution maybe we are the first life to evolve after all maybe life is just that rare or there is a LOT of life but to far way to detect
WHERE'S THE INTRO?!
Illuminati: STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE!!!
Have you ever read "The three-body problem"? it explains another layer to the Drake equation. It says that the reason we've seen no extraterrestrial life is that more advanced understands that if you send a signal, others can track your location. This means that by searching for extraterrestrial life by sending out these signals, you are putting yourself in danger. Just a thought
I am in 6th grade
did you know there's a outer space treaty? I don't think it's possible to populate the solar system if you can't exploit resources from the things in outer space.
Thank God this game is still somewhat relevant
It‚Äôs about god damn time!
If this topic interests you, do yourself a favour and check out the Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur channel.


He has many, in depth, videos about the Fermi Paradox (among other things.)
I mean yeah, we're pretty close to our OWN planet killing us with escalating weather, or our fellow inhabitants nuking us dust to dust.

We live in uncertain times and the future is looking bleaker and bleaker. If it's true, it doesn't take a genius to see we're a decade or two from hitting the filter.
Not looking good for the pale blue dot.
Still confused about the reason behind your videos being in practically the same format as your boyfriend's videos. Can't you develop your own style?
If you like this, check out the podcast "The end of the world" by Josh Clark. It's a 10 part series all about existential risks and the great filter. Very eye opening.
This was your master piece my friend
We've had a good run, I wouldn't be upset about us going extinct in the next 500 years or less, or more I guess
5:55 that‚Äôs why! Airplane mode is on
waching youtube to stop rageing about subnautca
We all will die we will go extinct it is inevitable so drink that bear eat that cheese Burger smoke that bowl shoot your guns love quickly forgive quickly live your life before it ends

I am german so it's really funny to hear the struggle to pronounce Kurzgesagt xD

Btw nice Theory  c:
Me, an intellectual, watches Isaac Arthur as well as kurzgesagt.
The Precursor was never a native of 4546B (the planet in Subnautica). The Precursors, or Almanac, came from another planet to 4546B to study the Kharaa Bacterium.
The moment i hear a click at the beginning, i know its austin
you forgot the fact that the precursers didn't originate on planet 4546b they just travveled there in a search for a cure to the kharrar
This video gave me depression...
6300 = 3x1xSx1x1x420
Congrats on #7 on trending on gaming!
There is ecosystem collapse near
I don't think I did 6th grade right ..
Jaaaaas im here
This theory doesn't make any sense at all. You said before that each filter is a coin flip on weather or not a life form can survive it, and there is likely one more filter that is yet to be discovered and experienced by Earth, but this would mean that humanity has a 50% chance of facing extinction, not that it is almost a certainty.
just because there are aliens doesn't mean they're more advanced like lets say we do find life on other planets and they are more advanced that means they have intelligence which means they have conscience which means they have emotions 
this stuff really makes you think
Of course
What‚Äôs the outro song?
Haha nice
I made you a gif, it's the logo that cycles through the 4 theory's (game, film, nugget and diet) to the rythem of the game theory intro. It's on my twitter, have a look
It's pretty chilling to think we are the only living things in the universe and I am angry if people even try to ruin a another planet I love all animals an if they eat me I don't care something like that sea emperor might exist other planet or otherwise on earth in deeper oceans with that power heack scientist might make a portal to Pok√©mon for all we know unlikely put possible with dark matter black hole experiments
Who the hell is Austin
*Sees subnautica
*Destroys trackpad trying to like video a mario plex amount of times
as an astrophycist in trainig, you get to a point that exestential dread is so common that it cannot phase anymore and at that point u know u lost: 
a)fear of everything
b)your humanity
c)your soul/life
Good thing this is all on the cosmic scale because if it wasn't I'd be peeing my pants right now
This is probably my favourite video Austin has ever made
I believe 99.9% of what you said went in my brain and the came back out.
We don't actually know if the precursors are extinct yet so i guess this is completly right...
Ayy game theory did a video about subnautica
We learned this stuff in sixth grade? I feel dumb üòû
wasn't really a subnautica theory tho
Never tell me the odds Austin. No seriously, I have enough trouble clearing my mind when I'm trying to sleep, I don't need something this mind-blowing to think about on top of everything else.
I think I need to rethink my lufe
3 of those numbers have a value of 0.  Problem solved!
Subnautica takes place in the late 22nd  century. Not a billion years from now.
Isn't that amazing that we exist? (sorry for bad english...)
What if your filter is Monica coming into the real world?
that last outro song tho. Anyone know what the title is?
Who is this man!?
Ali: Here a challenge for you. Try to make a theory of a game called ‚ÄúChanged‚Äù and ‚ÄúDazed‚Äù what the timeline and how are they related.

MATPAT
What's with the new zombie virus in USA, that's spreading in the news?
New video idea?!
I loved the epic music and transitions at the beggining
Ha watch in 30 years that we're still here. Good theory btw
Maybe they have other technology? NOT our technology? So we technically can't communicate with aliens unless they have our technology or we have their technology

Also I just found out that Climate change is natural. It is just a stage if we refer to the "Cosmic Calendar" or whatever that is. It is just an age like the Ice Age
Don‚Äôt forget about true vacuum, the most efficient way of destroying a universe
I find myself very positive now
All this assumes the theory of evolution is correct. If there is a deity, then maybe we are the only life that was made. If we are just consciousness and there is no reality, well... let's not go down that road.
Austin, that's not good parenting.  Good vid, tho.  Maybe S. Hawk and the other A.I. naysayers think that the A.I. milestone will be our Great Filter.  Maybe it will, if companies and countries use them for nefarious deeds, instead of treating them as beings that could help us all.
im scared now ;(
The best argument in not being able to find life out there yet would be that we are most likely the furthest ahead in technology, in our known universe. Subnautica was barely discussed, maybe a minute total. This was informative, but stupid for many other reasons.
Hn. Not sure I agree with this one. Lot less grounded in proven science, more on models that can only be speculated about.
Set the great filters against each other.
Just dont read the comments they have spoilers too. üò§üò©
What music did you use for this video?
Yeah never a fan of that paradox, too many assumptions and unknowns in it. That another civilization would be looking for others, that they would be using the comparable technologies to us, that they would communicate the same way as us, that there is a way to bend the laws of realty and move faster then light, and so on. 
But i do like the great filter theory side of it to a degree, still making assumptions based on life as we know it (like sexual reproduction), as it's about making logical barriers/milestones to cross there. Say quadruped species with super human level intelligence would still be dead in the water simply due to not having something akin to opposable thumbs.
Humans will go extinct by themselves for it is written
THE HUMAN RACE

        IS GONE!
Maybe the Cold war was the test?
I wasn‚Äôt even paying attention to the video.

I think that's the bedtime story wE aLL tell our children
don't worry we are all gonna be dead by 2040 cause global warming
not sixth grade mate 9th grade
edit :nevermind
13:04 Mr austin, I don't feel so good
The sass on that outro was just great.
Other theory, other life already exists and knows about us, but hides their existence from us because we're "that" planet
The only thing certain in life...is death.
Now your scaring me

The Sun is actually too small to explode, instead it will become a Red giant and eat us, then it will slowly fade
What song at the end??
where is matpat?!
Time doesn‚Äôt give a crap. If it moves forward and backwards infinitely, than there has been infinite time for the last filter to have happened and to happen. In other words we have all the time in the world to achieve perfection
YOU THINK THAT MATH PROBLEM IS EASY??????!!!!
Poor Tanya
Whats the name of the outro song?
There have been mystery singles received from other systems
this video is intellectual exclusiveness
what is the name of the song near the end?
video game: *exists*
game theory: WERE ALL GOING TO DIIIIIIEEEE!!!!!
The instant ‚Äúexistential dread‚Äù came up, I knew exactly what was happening.
and I thought Matt's video about zombie virus was the end of the world
mankind's greatest threat is itself. yes, it's cliche, but is also true. if we cared less about certain things we would already be on and have colonized another planet or, i don't know, the ocean floor by now. but we haven't.
sad, isn't it.
Dude. Whoa.
Dude. Whoa.
This video has nothing to do with subnautica
Where were you Charles
This, to me, gives even more reason why we need the smartest leading. And why we need more scientists, doctors, etc.
Should have been matpat
Austin has legitimately just given thousands of people an existential nightmare: good job. Thankfully I don't care, and I'm happy just living day-to-day knowing I'm lucky to exist, so the inevitable heat-death of the universe doesn't bother me, but I know a lot of people who this video would terrify. Note to self; don't recommend this one to them.
what if where from a matrix and our creators are in another matrix and they‚Äôre creator are in another other matrix and they‚Äôre creator creator is inside another matrix and goes on
lol this really makes you think...








1 in the 10 to the 340,000,000 power. What does this mean? The chance of a living thing chemically forming. And they say its 100% sure its going to happen?  Operationally impossible is a term scientists use to claim something is impossible. Opcerationally impossible is 1 to the 10 to the 70th power. That basically means that 70 10's times each other and out of that just 1 number, which = impossible. What is 340,000,000 10's times each other then? I like to call that Bull Sh1te! Its like trying to find 1 grain of sand inside of the known universe. You will still have a better chance of finding that grain of sand then life forming chemically on its own! I found out about the percentages and chance things at a video called "programming of life" or whatever. Also I copied it word for word, dont shoot me :P
That's what makes me happy
I hope it's AI that wipes us out, if something is going to... and something is going to.


There's something poetic about an minimally intelligent species creating a far more intelligent species and having that be the legacy that permeates the solar system. Somewhere between warring, forcing starvation upon our own species, and slowly destroying our planet we find a way to birth something that's greater than the sum of all of our parts. It's what makes us human. It will be a fitting and honourable end for us.
I‚Äôm more scared by drowning than spoilers, so will not be playing it. It looks absolutely terrifying to me lol
When 20 people say first
we killed whole lotta things lets take this end my friends i dont even know
FIRST LIKE!
I feel that intelligence is our filter. Consider that originally, we fought when needed. When we had to defend our families and that which is ours.. but now we fight, why? Because he has a shinier thing? Or his car his faster? We're regressing more than we are PROgressing and its affecting the species. I feel honestly I will see the end of modern humanity in my lifetime. Scary thought huh
so... the great filter is a win/win solution? 

hold on, I'm calling Donald now. He's got a hydrogen bomb Gatling gun we could use to speed this up
Haven't watched the video but is anyone really surprised, they were celebrating the right to abortion not that long ago

Are you ok dude?
Yo dude stop yelling... leave that to matpat
I'll never be able to sleep again...
So ignorance truly is bliss
blickcait
do a theory on little nightmares
Ok
Of course, one wouldn't have any existential dread if one believed in a higher power.  I am a firm believer in God and Christ, and I don't worry about the future of mankind.  I simply try my best to live in accordance with Christ's teachings, and the rest will take care of itself.  It's wonderfully freeing.

This is your best video yet, Austin. Good work.

Huh... I learned about great filters before I learned about the Fermi paradox.
Aka til about the Fermi paradox.
At least I‚Äôm not fazed by the idea of existential failure :3

Uhhh...who else is wondering were Matpatt is?
It‚Äôs kur giz at
I kinda felt like you where being like one of those pessimistic nihilists. Atleast I ain‚Äôt scared of this stuff.
or and hear me out here, maybe the universe is not random but is in fact of intelligent construction with one planet purposely having life put on it. while its true we have discovered other planets they so far have all been ether hot Jupiters or super earth way to big to support intelligent life dew to gravity. our solar system being an odd ball is not sum-thing of a universe created simply following  the natural laws of physics if it was there would not be odd ball systems the laws of physics are absolute so all systems would form similarly. the fact is weather you believe in god or not just statistically its more likely he exist than not and would it be worth it if you died and found out you where wrong.
ayYY video on subnautica...
:)
Hey MatPat Can You Do A Tattletail Theory Please I want You To Explain The Good Ending.
Matpat wanna be humans are going extinct subnautica proves it

me excuse me wtf
Taken out of context:
"Life isn't permanent, death is easy. That's the bedtime story I tell my child every night before putting them down." - Austin 2019
I thought that when Austin finally makes a Subnautica video it would be about how the Stasis Rifle makes no goddamn sense.
THATS IT IM GETTIN ME MALLET
The Imperium of Man sends its greetings from the 41st Millenia
can you stop screaming
Minecraft aquatic update
Cool idea for a game Theory what is the deadliest mini-game in Mario Party
Bum haha
4:36 who else counted the aliens
The one problem I have with 'the great filter' is that we honestly have no guarantee that life on other planets would look at all like us or require the same elements!
Okay what is the big sweeping orchestral music at the beginning of this video?
On your film theory channel you should do a flash theory because in season 1 episode 7 harrison wells says that RALPH DIPPNEY was affected in the particle accelorator,but in the latest season in episode 3  it states that he was exposed to dark matter on the bus so it doesnt make sence how he got affected twice.
I like this one a lot. It could just be because I'm a blunt emotionless creature though.
Your cat can live like that because it lives in a secure and insulated dwelling free of predators, fed nutrient rich food that replaces the need to hunt, and is treated with medicines and vaccines that extends it's natural life. It may not depend on it's own intelligence but it sure as hell depends on Humanity's

To the other point, The Drake Equation is really a guess at to what factors lead to intelligent life and even what is intelligent life. I don't think it is any more valid than other estimations. In fact I find a great deal of hope in the matter when you see that there are about 40 billion earth-sized planets ok our Galaxy and 11 Billion of those inhabit the habitable zone (where water exists in liquid form).  However we know life can exist above boiling temp and below freezing so whose to say that's the limit itself. Now,why haven't we heard from anyone... Maybe it's harder than we imagined due to distance and interference.
Whats the name of the song at the end?
Even if we are killed by A.I., we will still technically exist
A.I. was made by humans, and there is a chance that A.I. we get even smarter by themselves, which means A.I. could become spacefaring. So, there will still be a trace of human life, even if there isn‚Äôt any humans.
Notification Squad!
Heck yes subnautica game theory‚Äôs
This video was surprisingly uplifting.
the gun looks like symetras from overwatch
Kurzgesagt is german,kinda sounds like ‚Äûquartzgesagt‚Äú to make it a bit easier
I'm sorry i gotta get this out my system Coughs ITS NOT A EXPANSION PACK it is a separate game its more like Subnautica 2.
Yay! He's back! It's him Austin! Wait while I was writing this he just burped!??!?!?!?!?
Keep in mind this is fantasy.
Rehashes and talks about facts on other channel and references it
Guess shoddycast is dead thx Austin
We are taught to be problem solvers as kids in order to, essentially make the world a better place, but the more educated we are the more dangerous to ourselves we becomeüò•
well we hsve aliens on mars i mean we did discover some bacteria there
Its only game
I think everyone is overlooking the more simple reason, the first real barrier is actually having successful repopulating life.  Sure there are little things along the way from there, but the main issue is that even if life didn‚Äôt wipe itself as it‚Äôs next barrier, environmental situations can‚Äôt be the same for ever.  For example, important stars or planets around a planet can die, get destroyed, or by chance break out of orbit, or anything along these.  Often this can happen before life becomes intelligent enough, same with anything flying into the planet full of life, wiping it out.  There is a chance that there were a few groups of intelligent life forms in the past, but they most likely faced what we will face in the future, that their planet is becoming slowly less habitable or will be gone soon, but have most likely failed to find a new planet to inhabit.  Also, just because a new life form is made, doesn‚Äôt mean they need the same stuff as us, or develop anywhere close to how we did.  Their ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù could be in a way that is completely unlike ours, and what‚Äôs to say that they will ever make technology even remotely close to ours?
Of course our smarts will be our down fall. Ever seen technology with flashing lights and our brain?
What is the ending song. I love it.
So valve better release that half life 3 soon
1:00 I love how it's mostly jacksepticeye üëÄ‚ù§
I am happy with this new, calmer Austin. He's more competent, more dangerous, more ... alluring.
Ok Kurzgesagt
Resumido dice cagamos cabros as√≠ que, a emborracharse
Good video, but click-bait. It doesn't prove anything, maybe we haven't passed the great barrier, but that doesn't guarantee that we won't.
* screams with austin * THE SCIENCE!
8:00 yea I watch that channel and watched the ‚ÄúGreat filter‚Äù video
So how exactly do we go instinct?
Amazing video. I loved it.
The greatest of great filters will be the heat death of the universe
reads title 
Well that‚Äôs just lovely, isn‚Äôt it?
Well antibiotic immune bacteria, has already gotten a cure, of bacterias natural enemy. Viruses, that uses bacterias bodies to close themselves.

Or god will decide what will happen to us
We need fnaf theries
Voice crack as mf
this made me so happy. why? I don't know.
As it was explained in the video, humanity is already pretty near the end of that scale, which means we couldn't have to go through as many progressive halvings of our chances to survive to be space faring. if we take modern humanity as we are right now- the masters of our planet- and go from there to ruling our solar system and then our galaxy, that is still only two halvings that we have to go through, and thus a 25% chance of us surviving. Still not great, but i'd rather have that than the .1% chance of survival that is mentioned.
Its pronounced k-uh-r-zh g-e-s-ah-g-t and german for in short
I think a huge problem is that humans with their oh so superior intelligence have successfully stoped their evolution so no physical advancement, in fact I believe that human evolution may be going BACKWARDS I know this started ww2 but to an extent they were right on a VERY basic level
i like you, Austin, but this felt like a rehash of the In a Nutshell video with a Subnautica mic drop at the end. 
hoping for something better next time.
Why are you stating the obvious
Who are these guys
song at the end ?
thanks for bringing this up in a more concise manner, i had great difficulty explaining my politics without this
I think Austin‚Äôs becoming more philosophical after the RedDead2 vid and Deltarune vid. Anyone noticing that?
"...to drown a small, European nation." as a Dutch person, I am equal parts terrified and offended
gasps

Your last name is Hourigan?
Also even if we find another species it's very likely we would unintentionally wipe each other out because of disease.
Anyone who knows subnautica's lore and lore of Natural selection know that in both of the games two things appear : Alterra and Kharrar .
Also the enemy designs i Natural selection have features to aid in swimming,  tellig of the bacterias homeworld being mainly made out of water. There is also an enemy turret looking like a plant from subnautica that has the exact attack.
And to explain Alterra in NS they are funding the operation against NS creatures, with their logos apearing on equipment.
"subnautica on its surface " ha ha ha
When the Science is the only thing you still watch on game theory

anyone knows the song at the end?
üóø
nice story bro
... We didn't learn that in 6th grade.

We haven't learned it, period.

What did I miss
It's said Venus used to look A lot like earth. With traces of grass and water that used to be around. (There is A lot of proof and it makes A lot of sense. Too lazy to type it out. Look it up) maybe Venus contained a form of life at one point.
this...didn't prove anything
you didn't even show an impact subnautica has on the great filter argument
holy clickbait batman; i would have enjoyed this video if the premise wasn't just bait
Natural selection is related to this it‚Äôs the prequel
do a theory on little nightmares
Why don‚Äôt one of you guys make a fortnite theory about the next season
To Austin: While I cannot tell you WHICH "filter" will eventually cause humanity's extinction, I CAN tell you A "filter" that we are currently facing: Destruction via Mass. If Humanity (and things related to Humanity) grows/produces faster than the Mass that we (as a species) consume, we will eventually (or have already begun to) put increasing pressure on the core of our planet via increasing the Mass of the planet as a whole. And as already proven, putting increasing pressure on an active energy source such as the planet's core will cause Bad Things. Thus, Humanity is on a ticking clock to get off the planet and reduce the pressure being placed on the planet, which links back to things such as getting the scientific knowledge to leave and etc. etc.
FINALLY! A Subnautica video on GameTheory!
Sbnautica "proved" nothing, Austin
5:53 Basically my conversations with LittleZbot
FINALLLY A SUBNAUTICA THEORY
At 10 mins actually starts taking about subnautica
We could stop TB with bacteriophages
okay, but i love the background music on this one!! does anyone have any track names? i'm sorta desperate :')
I heard that as furry paradox..xD
pretend I said something smart
OmG the great filter
Anyone else click off when you hear hi it's me Austin
I very likely outro
What if alien machines aren't capable of receiving our messages, for all we know an alien planet could have it's own periodic table resulting in massive amounts of misinterpretation
I haven't watched the video yet is it about the great filter or the Fermi paradox?

AND MANY MORE! AUSTIN YOURE THE MAN!
I was so excited for a matpat video. 


Only to find out it was just more Austin screeching.
I literally can't understand a single thing this guy was saying.Can anyone explain to me in the simpliest way?
All the progression of human kind will go to waste and it‚Äôs pointless.
I wanted to express how much I enjoy the slow shift in tone in the last handful of Austin's videos. I was one of those fans that enjoyed his content but found the delivery to be a bit loud. There were times where I would excitedly click on a new theorist video and exit out shortly after because I didn't always respond well to his energy. Maybe I've grown as a fan or this is an intentional change but I'm really loving it and Austin. It's difficult to please the masses but I appreciate The Theorist creators for constantly growing and evolving alongside their audiences.  Thank you for always cultivating my curiosities, keeping me a more open human being and for the always wonderful content.
Dying is easy young man, living is harder
Thank you game theory I waa sick today but your videos helped the time pass thank you so much
Everything going to extinct.. :D some day
SHUT UP OSTIN subnautica is JUST a game üò†
i love subnautica
Only two minutes in and its already got deep, just great
honestly wtf how does this have anything to do with subnautica it's completly unrelated
Sorry but the editor place reminds me of Ronnie. RIP Ronnie.
0:13 voice crack
Austin!!!!!
or is that how its spelled
Hey are you a math teacher
5:05 Heh 420
Stop yelling like a soyboy.
i also love kurzgesart
The beacon hasn't beckoned life yet
I love watching game theory because stupid me can just watch smart people do math.
Yeetus deleetus, time to get rid if that feetus.
Jesus will come back before we hit the filter
This video still didn‚Äôt really have to do with subnatica
maybe pedantic, but your calculation of our chances against the next great-filter is off, you calculated it from the original starting point instead of from where we are now ... meaning it should be either 50% or 25% as the previous stages are already certainties.
‚ÄúSincerely, 
Austin‚Äù
Time to start my mid life crisis!
3:00 HOW THE HELL DID YOU KNOW I'M IN SIXTH GRADE AUSTIN
ARE YOU A MIND READER OR SOMETHING???
(WHAT THE FRICK???)
Our great filter? VOGONS! XD
And statistically speaking, there are absolutely NO civilizations, or inhabited planets in the universe.
Rest in pepperoni Drunk and Drug taking Austin. To my Italian man, rest in spaghet, never forget, no regrets.
Why is kurzgesagt not linked in the description
I mean werent we expecting the end of the world anyway? 

The caps melt then we have another ice age! Yup or we drown in our own overpopulating world of no resources
Great vid loved every part and every transition
Who dis? Hi Austin... whoever u r... I may have been watching these videos ever since the first vid came out but have never seen a video with Austin in it :P
What if we have received signals, what if we get them so often we don‚Äôt think of them as anomaly‚Äôs but just as something that happens
Directed Panspermia
Took you long enough
Miss Austin's shouting tho üòÇüòÇ
Salad fingers plz
Maybe a theory on the Cwd
We are all gonna die
Yay hes back
Before you can reach the stars you have the power and technology to wipe yourself out and that WILL probably happen. Intelligence without wisdom is doomed to die.
Bro subnautica is terror game, not anything of the layers you just said in this video.

This is my favorite episode by far. Amazing. Just amazing.

"Life is hard, dying is easy" -Austin 2019
Why do I keep watching your videos before going to sleep? I have work in the morning
Honestly, this video should have been about plague inc. XD
i hate getting reminded of all this stuff that can extinct us the most scary one i say is sun go boom or black hole give us big SUCC
Humans weren't supposed to go into space. Our developers didn't plan on it and didn't program that far ahead. We are due for an update.
your child is probably HELLA paranoid
Our great filter is..... Dun dun dun dun




Business, Money and Politics, these things are blocking our main goal to survive and thrive more and more... If we did focus on a life changing, beneficial for all human kind, we all could be having a great time now, but no...
meanwhile i learnt that we were going through our 6th mass extinction in 2016 when i was 10.
Oh my God you went over a minute without yelling
Life is so wonderful on planet earth, what we create so precious and yet we feel so alone when there's A LOT to do here? The universe had to be evil to end such a baby civilization like ours.
AH I AM JUST WJIREWPUKANSIN BEGGED FOR THIS AND IM SO HAPPYPYPYPYPYPYPY
Woah. I never thought of the idea that maybe we haven't surpassed our great filter. It's so easy to miss. Maybe the equation is 100% correct, we just will never find it because of some great filter we have yet to surpass. Maybe it'll take us too long to surpass and we'll be hit with an asteroid, or maybe it's extinction itself. Either way, we're more likely to not surpass the great filter if we can't already see life, and that's somewhat of a paradox itself: The more you know, the more likely you are to fail attempting to surpass a great filter.


That said, I really do like the equation and the odds that there are a lot more civilizations out there that we can really imagine. They could all be at the same stage we are, attempting to pass their next great filter. But who is to say that if there are so many species that there isn't one who  surpassed the many great filters and are helping other species pass their's in order to populate the galaxy, rather than individual planets. If one passes the great filter of finding a civilization, they must have the resources in order to have done so, and those could be used to benefit other species into surpassing their great filters.


Ugh, there is just soooo much possibility. I guess there is one thing we can all agree on, though: We had a good run.
10:00 Also...there is a chance they are populating galaxies right now and we will only know in a few million years...
Climate change is clearly our great filter and it looks like one we are going to fail :(
I wanna see the game theory analytics where watch time for Austin videos is three seconds because 90% click off as soon as they see its him and not matpat.#riprobbie
Yo
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà‚É†
POSITIVE NHILISM....
KURZGESAGT IN A NUTSHELL YES
Do you actually email the game companies or do you just use that as an intro
So the story line is exactly the same as the mass effect plot
Love the "in a nutshell" shout out.
I know its just a game theory but im scared
I'm so grateful for only being able to watch this at the middle of the night
I mean scientist estimate that in about 100 years earth won‚Äôt even be able to sustain itself at the rate we‚Äôre going now so lmao
I think there's also a possibility to consider that we're using the wrong tools, and that in terms of viability of extended space travel we're not as far along as we think we are. We use radio wave technology because it's basically good enough for one planet, but beyond our solar system it doesn't scale very well due to speed of light constraints. It could simply be that we don't detect the radio signals of spacefaring civilizations because radio is not a good fit for the needs of spacefaring civilizations, and we're just getting ahead of ourselves thinking that what we have is obviously what intelligent aliens would be using.

Put another way, perhaps we're trying to look for quantum particles using a campfire instead of a supercollider.
Damn, its Austin. Ugh, I guess I'll watch it
Well, at the very least our odds are better than one might think, considering that only the precursors are really like us, as the sea emperor leviathans are like dolphins, in the fact that they have no ability to build tools
I got FOMO of not knowing how humans will die while watching this video.
JESUS STOP WITH THE MOZART, omg like wut it's so loud pls stop it's scary
6:48 "Sea Emperor Leviathan intelligent, uhh... giant whale thing"
clearly has tentacles attached to it

Yep. You really nailed it. Not only is the thing not a mammal--unless recent lore developments have revealed it feeds it babies milk from mammary glands--but it doesn't even breathe air from the surface. Maybe I could have excused the fact that we don't know how it feeds it's babies and that it's tentacles don't define whether or not it's a whale,  but it's been underwater for so long that there is no possible way in hell it would receive enough oxygen to live if it was a surface-breathing animal.

Worse yet, if you were using "whale" as a synonym for something big, the thing is literally called a "leviathan." A leviathan is a big creature, said to be bigger than  in the ocean. Sure, leviathans are based on whales because they are similarly big, but that's only for comparison; a leviathan is not synonymous with a whale, it's just a big sea creature.

This may seem really nit-picky, but the damn thing is called a leviathan. You could at least have said "uhh... leviathan," or even used a personification, like "skyscraper." Anything except what it is pretty much the exact opposite of: a whale.
When you think its Matt pat but it‚Äôs just Austin üòí
Our solar system is going through a belt in the galaxy called the Photon Belt. IDK what it really, is, but basically its supposed to be a great filter that will NEARLY wipe out humanity.
There was a less than 0.1% chance to survive the cold war without total nuclear escalation. We made it this far and even though we are idiots destroying our own planets there are always manufacturing defects in us humans who manage to save the system from collapsing or salvage the broken system to start a new one
Correct me if I'm wrong but I see a massive flaw in your final mathematical conclusion of us having a .1% chance of survival. That .1% was at the start of the 12 great filters and assuming that the first two are givens and the rest are a coin flip. You're postulating there may still be more filters but by what you've shown we've passed a large majority of them and only have one or two more therefore we have a 25-50% chance of survival based on this loose and generous interpretation of the great filter theory not a .1% chance.
Hey it‚Äôs God‚Äôs plan
This... this video has nothing to do with Subnautica... It's not even science, just philosophy with theoretical statistics thrown it to make it look like science... 




am disappoint
YES FINALLY







A SUBNAUTICA THEORY





I HAVE BEEN WAITING AN ETERNITY 






THANKS A LOT AUSTIN






üëå
Clicks video ‚Äúokay, MatPat doesn‚Äôt normally do this kind of thing...‚Äù
sees google format ‚Äúoooohhhhh, nnoooooo.......‚Äù
y'know when I heard about the great filter I just said to myself that as long as we only encounter one or two other species then we're in the clear since that keeps it rare but still possible to overcome
YESS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A SUBNAUTICA THEORY!!!
Sir I believe you've gone mad
Austin, you could have done a why the hell does the main protagonist can go 1k meters deep without becoming a crushed tin can, not to mention the sea moth that does have upgrades to go deeper but, and the glass? Goddammit it ain't even reinforced glass, it's just glass!

Maybe I could come up with something even crazier like how hot it should be the plasma cutter to cut underwater reinforced titanium that can go through the atmosphere with no problem until it crashes at God knows what kind of speeds...
Also, notice how the protagonist gets hit by a giant metal sheet in the head?
Or how fast should the pod crash into the water and what forces the protagonist suffers at point of impact?
Got many more
I might need anxiety meds after this honestly...
I wanted science not depression but still nice vid
That has happened. We have received a radio message from the Andromeda Galaxy
Ok so basically I won't be able to sleep now.
Thanos effect~
Maybe they send out the crap out of the transmission Systemanalyse we can't just receive them, because they use an other technology/possibility of communication and possible didn't Invent Radio Technology at all.
What if we are the ones who start it all. What if we are just looking for ourselves.
Where's the intro and matpat
Aliens have left behind relics u been to Egypt and seen them pyramids?

3:19 Music?
Kind of funny you mention 'we could be missing something', when the theory you point out are based on evolution, itself being a flimsy theory that cannot be a functional foundation with any reliability for higher learning, lol.
Austin > Matpat
Austin: And that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to prove my theory on Subnuatica!

Me: OOoOOoOorrr......
You could crack open the Bible and get your fricken answers there

we are our own worst enemy
At least it isnt a video about maypat crying
this is one of my favorite austin videos!
It makes it so much worse that he doesn‚Äôt end it with ‚Äú that‚Äôs just a theory, a game theory!‚Äù
Twelve years Austin. Twelve years. That's how long we have until climate change gets irreversible and we're all screwed. Come to think of it, it has been a while since that came to light so maybe it is more like eleven at this point, maybe ten.
i still don't think we're looking at this, our sample size of what life "should" look like is literally 1, there might be intelligent stuff out there we wouldn't even classify as life, we don't know enough about anything to make predictions about how many intelligent beings there are in the universe
Maybe this is just a simulated reality?
Why do they assume that life can only exists in such a way that is observed from humans? 

The ocean is literally filled with tons of weird almost impossible to exists things and yet we even haven't scratch the surface. I think once we get to explore the ocean, our ideology of life and intelligence will change dramatically.

This is why I am religious. The chances of us existing are so slim that you almost have to have more faith in science than a creator. The science we find does not disprove God, but they are tools h may use. We are discovering a different side of God, not that he doesn't exist.

stop shouting man. It's uncomfortable on headphones even with low volume
Finally, another The SCIENCE!!! video.

Probably my favourite episode on this channel...
I saw the title

Depression 100
I like the new style of video ngl, but a part of me does miss the sheer enthusiasm and excitement of past videos.
THE ALL AWAITED SUBNAUTICA THEORY
I actually really like the credits :D
One SIMPLE equation ???
What if aliens either don't WANT to reach out (and put themselves in danger of invasion)?
you know, even if we were able to pass one of the barriers, there will be another one, because there are an infinite amount of barriers to kill all the living things. And IF we were able to pass trhough some of them, the longest years we'll get is until all the stars collapse(idn tbh) the black holes die and then the white dwarfs would die(the heat sources [not that we could heat ourselves with an air conditioner, but it would use the oxygen]). After that the oxygen would run out, then the temperature would fall, and everything will die, just an big lifeless universe.
i'm sorry if i talk too much when the topic is science and sorry for the bad spelling i'm brazillian and i am still learning english
Okay, that was a lot to take in. So, what you're saying is, if we were to find remnants of civilisation on other, distant planets, it would provide a negative context for the great filter theorum, and show that our destruction as an intelligent species is unfathomably likely, enough so to call it, for all intents and purposes, inevitable?
At the same time, if we don't find any intelligent life out there, nothing changes; we're still in the dark, still unsure about how it'll all play out, et cetera... it seems like the best case scenario is that we do encounter intelligent life that's about on our level, but what if that just means that we progress toward our great filters at the same pace? What if a war starts, and we just become each other's filter? 
I'm not even sure if I had a point to make or anything, my mind is kind of boggled. Hoo boy.
Climate change is the real threat.
or maybe because we dont see other life because maybe if we go instinct there is another life formed in the other side of the universe
Green for some reason
Soooo, not sure if it matters at all, but does Natural Selection influence this theory in regards to the situation humanity is in in Subnautica at all? The games are in the same universe, Astera is the main company in both and Kharaa also appears in both, albeit in Natural Selection it's a heavily mutated version of the bacterium.
There is nothing more funny than seing others trying to speak german as a german haha
Song?
what the hell is he saying
this comment  is for matpat, if u look through the ultimate custom night list i noticed that puppet, springtrap, golden freddy, ennard and baby have 2 forms, nightmarrione, afton,  nightmare fredbear molten freddy and elizibeth then i  thought some more and acording to youre videos these animtronics are some of the most talked about in lore also notice how each's second form is deformed or more of a nightmare
Honestly, not the first time I've heard of the great filter and it's still GODDAMN TERRIFYING
Technically we passed the great filter already but to other intelligent life, but we're so far maybe we happened before them or after them...
OR the civilisation hears our message, but has a Austin of It's own, which says that humans could be the ones to end them, so they would just ignore the message, hoping we'd never discover them.
I know about kurtzgedstuuumitga I watch them
This video had practically nothing  to do with subnautica. :/
Austin is clearly an optimist
No fudge, Austin
well duh, of course we're going extinct. That's why there's a heaven and hell idiots.
I hate when early acces games have paid dlc when it isn't even finished. Just like Ark survival evolved
I recently read a book that had space travel, but once you left the earth and moon you were no longer allowed to come back to earth because you may carry a teeny tiny distinction level microbe. I thought well that‚Äôs harsh but this definitely makes a good rationale for it
great filter I KNEW IT
8:30 IT SAYS 1998 OR MAYBE I AM JUST STUPID
To infinity and beyond
The Great filter might be something that's already begun and we don't realize it. Take a look at the experiments on Rat Utopia. In short a giant pen made to be the perfect home with plenty of housing, food, and water was made to be everything they needed. Yet before they filled the pen to it's holding capacity the population collapsed and ultimately became extinct. 

The issue was the rats had everything they wanted and eventual lost interest in breeding and taking care of their young, instead favoring doing things that made themselves feel good for the most part. If you look at much of the developed world the birth rate is on the decline as people have fewer children both due to their no longer being the fear that most will die as well as the general desire to not have children and instead focus on themselves. 

The decline in the experiment was not a gradual one either but rather a complete collapse as the last large generation born simply didn't have any children at all. And when moved to a new pen their behavior remained with them no having any interest in breeding thus resulting in an irreversible collapse. 

There are those who argue Humans are smarter than rats and would be able to see this coming but is that really so? Many countries are already talking about the coming issues caused by a large elderly population with much fewer in the younger generation. As well as many in that younger generation also forgoing having kids. Odds are people will turn to automation to solve the labor shortage but no address the underlying issue of their being fewer people each generation. While others argue it's a good thing due to their belief the planet is overpopulated. 

Of course as the video mentions this is just one of many possible things that could get us in the end. And it could be like the Dinosaurs where most are taught the meteor killed them yet more research has shown that it was likely the final nail in the coffin as they were already on the decline before hand.
Yeet
Where is Matpat???
good video, so I am doing a literary analysis for Isaac Asimovs last question and trying to break it down into simpler to understand wording that things are a potential cycle any advice on that Austin/internet is a great short story just tough to break down for a 90 year old English teacher lol
My friend showed me this game
TIHI
maybe intelligence isnt ideal for evolution tons of smart people often cursed there existences and were very okay with death thats kinda the opposite of survival of the fittest i mean sure it made us the dominant species but how many people do you know are truly all together  maybe we would be better off without our concessions without our complex emotions we need professionals just to cope with the dam things and even they still dont even fully understand them and they are what make us so i have to doubt we have the ability to predict the end of humans right now or what a intelligent lifeform even is

How could you MatPat?
You should name the game theory episodes that didn't come out "Game Hypothesis" because they couldn't make it all the way to be a "theory"
Why don‚Äôt you call them diet theories does anyone remember that from that one old video? 




No okay
My takeaway from this video is that mattpat recommends we eat 5 medium fries from McDonald‚Äôs per day to live
Hey man, good on you guys for crediting your sources. Now people can see what kind of info you‚Äôre working off and do their own research rather than just hate out of the blue.
As someone who enjoys this show while also seeing the flaws (theories being poorly/under researched and overall feeling of you bypassing actual criticisms and arguments as ‚Äòhate‚Äô) I‚Äôm really happy to see you finally make a move in the right direction. I understand being busy but I‚Äôm proud you‚Äôre now crediting and I hope that episodes are improved because of this attention to detail.
So thanks for sourcing and I hope you update less so that each theory feels well done and professional, trust me, a lot of long time fans would enjoy it and newcomers would experience the magic of your old ‚Äòvideo game science but in real life‚Äô stuff.
Sorry this was long but I REALLY hope people (matpat especially) see this.
People are all commenting about how this video was sponsored by TikTok, but I'm more concerned about this theory not having an intro!
"Can be solved relatively easily"

MATPAT YOU BETRAYED US
Hi MatPat, you mixed up power and energy - the conversion from exajoules into gigawatts is a huge mistake (it has to be gigawatt-hours and thus you don't consume gigawatt/year but simply gigawatt or gigawatt-hours/year). Nevertheless, you make very entertaining videos, thanks a lot.
I guess this explains why the sun got dim in sunshine.
At this point, this channel is an extended commercial for Nintendo.

Hey Mat Pat, do a game theory on Dark Deception pls!
He sells the stars and moons and suns on the black market.
And when he collects a moon, star, or a sun one of them is removed from the universe.
The fuel is really just using the air from the sky, Mario is killing the universe as we know it.
Think about that...

When Matt patt said about the McDonald French fries I literally just finished eating McDonald French fries and he said medium sized one, I also had the medium size. Lol üòÖ
Dear MatPat, you were talking about how some theories don't go into production at 15:23 because they were too short. I believe that many viewers would love to see some of these and you can include these with something like a special where you gather a few of those theories that aren't long enough and put them together in one video. To also make it not completely random, pick the theories that have a common factor, such as a Mario themed. That way you have a nice video of content and we the viewers learn a little bit more about some of our favorite games.
"More power than we originally thought"
Proceeds to title the video saying that the moon has no power
Mat: Lets put this measure of power to something more understandable. 
Talks about food
Ah yes, now I get it, because I know how many candy bars it takes to run my fidge or fries I fuel my car with and thus is highly relatable.

Splatoon's language should be a theory of its own. Like heck, is it really a language that exists on earth or did Nintendo create it just for Splatoon?

I have not done any research on this, so Nintendo might have confirmed that somewhere, so please don't @ me.
Okay, there's no way that spectrometry stuff was a coincidence. Someone at Nintendo is brilliant.
TikTok... Really...
The most dead meme of all time.
This entire theory is solved by one thing:  Power Moons regenerate their power over a short period of time.  Think about it - there arent that many moons in the power plant, they're all just running on a cycle, so that a freshly recharged one is being drained while the others regain their power. 

 Your ship can fly to previous areas because the moons you have regenerate and serve as fuel to go back - but going to the next area takes more fuel, so you need a 'bigger tank' (more moons) to do it.  Going to the moon ain't cheap on gas, amigo!

Matpat: 1.7 Megajoules...

Freshman: 


(don‚Äôt hurt me. imma freshman so i can make this joke)
Can you make a theory of Fire Emblem?
Like a Timeline or something?
and so the final titan of the Internet was consumed by tiktok, and all was dark
What happened to the intro?!?!
Mega juuls? Oh heck yea bro is it mango? Yo let me take a hit
Rmember at the start of the video Matt told us if we can survive by not touching the coins? Did you survive? I know I did. Not to flex.
"i just simultaneously wiped and nay'neay" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
15:44
Creators betrayed us, we got it on tape.
Soooo....
Nobody is going to comment about how there is no intro...?

Ok then
what if it was the only one and every building was running on an auxillary emergency plant?
why is marios shull pertruding from his head in the thumbnail?
I'm studying spectrometer right now and modern physics. It's is the first time that I actually understand one of these videos. üòÇüòÇ
This man used a care salesman meme in February of 2019.
Watches episode: That was cool! 

Sees Sponsor: NO MATPAT, NO!!!
Umm nope A SPONSOR FOR TIKTOK???
Film therey 
A seres of unforchon events
Real story
1 Joule = approximately 4 calories  
1 kilojoule or 1000 joules = approximately 4  kilocalorie or 4000 calories
In paper Mario ttyd they u lock some ancient door.
MatPat has taught me more about science than my science teachers
I swear I learn more from this series than actual school üòÇüëåüôÉ
Instantly one of my favorite Game Theory videos. Well done MattPat, Well done.
Now that Kingdom hearts III has finally dropped would you consider doing a theory on the Dandelion Leaders? And Streletzia?
What if the empty moons get refilled when they leave the screen and recycled into the power over and over again 
N
who else puked at the words tik tok 




ugh, I'm getting flashbacks of the war
And parents say video games are bad for you. THIS GUY IS A FRICKING VIDEO GAME SCIENTIST!!!
SOTHE GAME THEORY TIKTOKS ARE REAL????? I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FAKE ACCOUNT!!
YouTube needs an algorithm that recommends shorter videos.  Also I will never get a TikTok acc.  

Also anyone else think MatPat might have a point here.  Mario does like to waste things that could produces a lot more energies if he used them correctly, rather than wrongly.  I liked this video.  It was fun.
Thank you Matthew  Bagas. Your help is much appreciated
Everyone hating on MatPat being sponsored by TikTok and other things must‚Äôve forgotten that he and a bunch of others recently got screwed over by Defy Media and Ally bank :/
10:14 lol he messed up from saying New York to Calgary in canadaü§£
It's funny how he says "You will know in about 10 minutes!" Looks at time. 17 minutes long okay mat okay,
Cool episode




WAIT... TIKTOK???
I trusted you...
That was a lot of info! I love these theories. ‚ô•Ô∏è Great work guys!
It was bad enough that Tiktoc adds were everywhere but now matpat why I thought you were different üò∞
Anyone else feel that this video ends abruptly? and actually feels a little sloppy? He says he¬¥s gonna prove that it produces this much energy by determening what the moons are made of but he never does. He says they are made of helium 3 but never reach a conclusion of the video. I¬¥m not sure what his point was. It just feels bad.


Also it doesn¬¥t have an intro. Scary stuff.
@matpat who is bloodhound from Apex legends
2:45 nice rampage reference  love that really underated midway game
I have an idea for a Film Theroy:anyone watched the movie HOME well...is it possible to make a flying car made of SLUSHIE!!!!...HUH MATPAT?... I NEED TO KNOw THIS!!!!
I hear that scott cawthon is posibly making a 8th installment for fnaf. #ilovemario
Where the frick is the episode intro!
Mk8 deluxe theory: would the gold kart work?
Also matpat don't forget that in smash brother ultimate why don't you also use the skins
You should do a theory on Stardew Valley!!! Maybe trying to figure out Linus' past, or who Wizard's daughter really is, or how Grandpa is able to come back at the end of the third year.
plz do a PVZGW2 THEORY
no Mario collets power moons so that thanos can‚Äôt have them
before i watch this video i have to say.
one day a toad walked up to a lemonade stand.
and said to the toadette running the stand~
the toad said "hey~" bap bap bap~ "can you travel the world scatter these moon curency with litte value. and find a red man to give all back cause im bored"
bap bap bap~ the toadette said " no"
  toad said " DO IT."
Love u matpat were in this together gotta  love your mario vids keep doing what love  good luck like if you support matpat
You NEED to do a video on Wilbur The Editor (on Jacksucksatlife's channel) cos' he keeps giving clues on what is going on and we can't work them out alone.
I realized that I was playing Super Mario Odyssey while watching a SMO theory
Where the heck is the intro song?
you should try and find why talking in "harry potter hogwarts experience" takes you %20 of you'r energy
THE FBI WOULD LIKE TO *KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
Hey matpat, make a complete gravity falls timeline!
You could not have used instagram ?!

1.7 MegaJoules
1.7 Million dollar lie. I smell a conspiracy.
 MCMs are connected to Mario!

 Welcome to my ted talk, where I talk about how Mega Moons in SuperMario are responsible for million dollars of debt.
...1.000 years later... HA GOT IT !!! (OVER 9.000 MEME!!!)...
I love you, Matt. I love Game Theory. But I will never ever EVER download Tik Tok. Love saving money with Honey, though.
1:44 "literal butt ton"?
I'm sorry, what?
Mat pat betrayed all of us with is sponsor
Fanfic levels mario maker wii u  created Maximus plz play
Hey how fast does Scooby-Doo and Shaggy run in Scooby-Doo
I did not sign up for a Chemistry lesson. I thought that I was done taking that class!! But I guess now I see that my teacher was right, and that the stuff I learned do apply to the real world, or should I say the video game world!!
Will you ever revisit the mario time line? with new games coming Im curious about your theory about it.
Mat if you have a theory but its too short or somthing you should make a new channel. Ypu can call it mini theory
can you do a theory  with ark:survival evolved i think  there is a much
Hey, Game Theory's fan base new name should be "Matt's Pack"! Ey? üòé
This video is full of so much useless informaton i feel like it broke my brain üòÇ
Aren't you assuming that the power plant is 100% efficient?
Make a new channel and put those there you can call it game theorists Extras
MatPat thinking we are stupid with the 1.7 mega joules per second x 1 equal 1.7 mega joules
With tje infinite has thing I have a theory. What if the moon's jad an infinite power source because game logic and the power would be low voltage so he needs more moon's to charge the oddssey faster to save peach wifu.
UNDERTALE THEORY!: Is there two sans's because of deltarune! cause in undertale, people called sans "sans undertale" so, is the sans from deltarune called "sans deltarune"? PLEEAASSEE DO A VIDEO ON THIS!!!
9:10 NOT PER SECOND. PER HOUR! 

IF IT WAS PER SECOND THEN A 10W LIGHT BULB WOULD USE 36,000 WATTS PER HOUR, 864,000 IN A DAY, AND 25,920,000 A MONTH. THATS 25 MILLION WATS A MONTH.

Thats 25,000 kilowatts of power form one light bulb per month. At the national average of 13 cents per kilowatts thats an electric bill of over 3000 dollars.

You are wrong sir.
My god I thought you were joking when you said that TikTok sponsored this episode.
So are you saying that the amount of energy required to power about 2 blocks of New York City for one second is about the same as the amount of energy in a medium order of fries?
My family: Stop stressing over it, it's just a game/movie/cartoon!
Me: Matpat get's why I'm so suspicious of that one episode and that one game character and those movies!
Fam: Who?
Me: You don't watch game or film theories, you wouldn't understand!


And now my family is always even more confused when I obsess over details about fictional things because I'll always say 'watch Matpat and you'll understaaand Dx'
:P

Here's a good idea Matt, calculate the speed of a minecraft character. Me and my friend calculated it and it is fascinating. No joke it is really cool
You should do a life theory on why ninja accidentally streamed and is anything wrong with him
Did you look at the description of Petscop 11?
MatPat talking about how much fuel the Odyssey uses makes me think of how much pollution is in the Mushroom Kingdom...
Dude why tik Tok üôÑü§®
MatPat: ‚ÄúJoin me viewers!‚Äù
Me: How about... no?
Is it elevated using power as well?
Actually, we know how to do fusion power. We just haven't figured out a way to make it practical yet.
Check out Kurzgesagt's video on the topic for more information.

P/S: Sorry Rosalina, you're not the only one who knows how to collide stuff together.
And if you use code sans=Ness now you can get UP TO 30% OFF STAR FUEL
I remember watching matpat in 5th grade not understanting a word 
He said and now im like whoooooooooooo i Understand yeeeeeeeee
You joined TikTok at the wrong time. The app is getting worse and not getting fixed. Even with the beta, it's already ruined.
0:19 Can we talk about how a mario skeleton is t posing
Ok on your theory that Mario is a psychopath I think he‚Äôs is but on The Luigi part I think is wrong because in Luigi dark moon at the end Mario  complements Luigi after saving him
Matpat.
Go to TikTok.
Tell them you are no longer sponsored by them.
Leave.
Never go onto TikTok ever again.
NO I WILL NEVER FALL TO TIKTOK FORGET IT IMA JUST PAY FOR ZEE MERCh
Everybody is worried about the vid being sponsored by TikTok, while I'm like "WHY U NO HAVE NO INTRO?????"
13:00
Yea science!
OMG! Was this video number ONE on TRENDING?
its legitimately beautiful how matpat embraces the fact that tiktok is cringe by making cringe

respecc mat, respecc
Of course you announce that your giving away yet to be announced merch but you have to download discount musically
Doesn't get any coins* hA!
I would like to see a theory on the logic of why Captain Toad can't jump (how does power star weight work? They can float in the air, but they also (might) be able to weigh a person down). I say might because we don't truly know what is in his backpack
FUSION! HA!
mat not you  tick tocks gone to far save your self
I always wandered if the death star would ever be possible. Like would gravity have the whole thing collapse or would there be enough mettle to make a moon
So on and so forth
Upload another zelda theory if u can plz
I can't think about helium 3 without thinking about space Nazis.
Hey MatPat, you should do another Fortnite theory!
1.7 million got taken from creators please dont hate on matt pat please. He has bills you know
When can we see the game theory where MatPat proves that yoshi commits tax fraud?!
you have no reason to think that isn't the only power plant when it literally is, so your theory is obviously wrong, because you're underestimating the amount of energy they regenerate to simplify the research required for your theory.


also sorry if i had any mistypes i am from iran( unfortunately ).

I'm pretty sure you won't notice this one comment. I wanted to suggest you making a game theory on Witcher 3 (and DLC) who is the right girl for the witcher.
Thanks.

yay
maybe
You should put beauty and the beast service to the test
15:47 I'm sorry friends. He is on the dark side now.


EDIT: I just wrote this as a joke and then saw everybody hating on MatPat down below. I don't get why people need to just be total pieces of you know what all the time.
Hope your channel doesn't change because of the new sponsorship. Some sponsors can be controlling.
I love listening to game theory while playing games and a dramatic boom towards the beginning scared the daylights out of me while I was playing XD
He said fusion, steven universe theory confirmed?
so the odyssey ship has a fusion reactor
i think Moons in Odyssey are more of a Repair-item for the titular ship...when you first see the abandoned Odyssey, its all rusted to oblivion and needs just the bare-minimum amount of moons to get back to 'running' condition...but the sail(?) on top is only a mere sliver of its full potential, here...so you advance through the game, collecting more moons, making more Repairs to the Odyssey, enabling it to travel further (fuel is irrelevant, but Damage can hinder Distance)...eventually, you get enough moons to make it to the Earth's Moon, the Odyssey's sail(?)-top-thing now being a completely spherical Balloon(?)-top-thing, gashes in the exterior hull have newly welded patches filled in, etc etc; at this point you can travel Wherever you want, Whenever you want, even without collecting any additional moons (if you Do collect some, theyll just make the balloon-top-thing Bigger) because the Odyssey doesnt need Fuel...it only needed Repairs...but hey, thats just my theory, A FAN'S THEORY! thanks for reading :)
I have not played Odisey. But
¬øCould the moon requirement be not for the "gas usage to get there" but for the colective power output to reach the "needed power" but the moons themselfs have loads of "energy reserves"?
In other words. I "theorise" that the moons are used as low power, high durability batteries.
are we just gonna forget there was no intro????
Odysseus would be proud
TRY TO ANALIZE HIS TROJAN HORSE
Woopers are just shiny dittos that have "created a new Pokemon" to escape from thei rfellow, nonshiny dittos Upvote if you agree
I have a idea for a theory how fastest does team rocket blast off
Matpat i dont think you really took consideration of the coloring in the moon in the neon spectrum as you seen red but when i paused the video on the moons coloring i saw a slight orange what gives man?
The sad thing is i understood every word he said about spectrometers
Mat pat: Can you watch this video without touching any coins? No, no you cannot
Me: Pff don't make me laugh puts hands in pockets to look cool
Also me: finds my long lost penny in there Awh shiet
Is it just me or "new dong City" sounds wrong...
You are gonna have a fun time with stage possibilities in SMM2. Don't lie, you'll do it. We know how curious you'll be.
Also, being completely original, maybe call your new number a Luigiplex. I know. So original.
I think this could go one step further:

If we assume the helium moons are burned in the power plant rather than undergoing fusion, how much helium would need to be combusted to create the megawatt output we see? Then how much heat energy would we get if it instead underwent fusion with that same amount of helium?

I think we would determine a planet-killing death bomb is powering Mario's pimped out whip.
It's quite possibly worth noting that Super Mario Galaxy had you collecting the Grand Stars from Bowser's __ Reactors, the blank being filled by "star", "galaxy", or other such.
Maybe this isn't such a shock.
You know how Knuckles punches so hard that it breaks stuff? I wanna know why.
lol you changed the meta for the over 9000 jokes xD
Why does game theory teach me more than my science teacher?
the powermoon fuel thing bothered me as much as star wars ships running out of fuel XD i was like why can you go back then lmao
Man can't wait to see Mat pat lip sync Despacito!!  Hell yeah!!
Pls stop hating on Mat just cuz he sponsored tik tok. Just be happy because by sponsoring tik tok, mat pat earns so he could make even more awesome vids

Edit: sorry *tik tok is sponsoring him hehehe thanks @epic 236
When you accidentally found it before you watched this
I love your guys videos, I myself enjoy your dedication to research. You earned this subscription, though I thought I already was haha
15:42
Me:Nooooooooooooooo
How many possible matches are there in tf2
Power Moons might not have power, but Power Suns do.
So they‚Äôre made of helium...
And they‚Äôre powering a giant balloon...
try to find where is GTA 5 aka Los Santos Located
No Intro APOCLYPSE!!!!
Mat pat episode 11 of salad fingers is out it might hold the evidence to see if your theory from 2 years ago was true
Why mat ,why! Why tiktok! WHY!
Documentaries: We measure in Swimming Pools and School Buses

MatPat: I use Square Meters

Documentaries: Woah there, that makes too much sense

MatPat: Ok so, Calories?

Documentaries: Getting Warmer

MatPat: Candy Bars and light bulbs

Documentaries: There you go!
15:45 and with that you have lost matpat goodbye who ever accept a sponsor Tiktok
This isn't a completely correct way to estimate this. Sure you could use the power consumption but only for the MINIMUM amount of power possibily produced by the power moons. That doesnt mean the power moons don't produce excess power.
Nooooo MatPat!! He's fallen into TikToks trap
I‚Äôm still waiting for that Yoshi tax fraud video
The explanation of the spectrometer shows how libra changes his special move colors and the frequency of it.
i bloody well wish nyc went green :(( too much dirt imo
The Power Stars actually go back at least to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. And of course they also go back to the original Super Mario game and the Invincibility Stars Mario collects that provide him protection from damage and allows him to power run through all enemies for a few seconds.
Can you do a saled fingers part 11 theory just asking because saled fingers part 11 is out its called glass brother
TIKTOK MATPAT 
WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHA WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU MAN
wth 1:44 / 17:49
tick tock advertisment
Matpat joined the dark side
2.45, maybe the next kingdom is farther away?
Would it be your first 2 followers for the merch or will you be picking at random? Also when will you be choosing?
People with AirPods are poor coz they can‚Äôt afford the wire
Hey Matt, I have a question: How much power should Meta Knight have on his wings, considering that he can destroy blocks by just flapping near said blocks? ü§î
Wait... Did you just fail to translate the yearly consumption to power/second?
HOW CAN I SUB OF I ALREADY DID
Even if your ideas are to short or go off the rails, we all would like to watch/hear them. Make a new category for it.
Wow a bunch of people just disliked this video because of its sponsor and yes frick tik tok but come on
7:03 to get real $




May ur feelings not be hurt
ok. are you ever going to do an update on the ‚Äúnew doki doki game‚Äù? Because to me it seems like that wont be happening...
3:47 You said it yourself: you don't reach New Donk City until midway through the game.
There wasn‚Äôt a intro
i got a notification on google saying that i won a iPhone x giveaway
is it true?(Pleas respond)
Press F to pay respects to Matpat and his team hard works.
Hey matpat can u make a channel called diet theory just to make little mini theories with fan ideas
can you do a theory about Kingdomhearts
No matter what, I'll never get TikTok. NEVER
I always get so excited when he starts talking about things I know from physics class.
Actually MatPat according to the so called ‚Äúamendments‚Äù of New Donk City the city is also supposed to collect energy from the moon it‚Äôs self. Which is why you can see one of the ships that were floating around during the New Donk City festival on it.
Mat can you do a theory on how the suits work in this new game called anthem
DID SOMEBODY SAY JUUL?!?
Can you make a new series called 5- minute theories or something like that? You mentioned a lot of the videos you make are too short, but we would love to see them.
I learn more science from this channel than I do from my actual science classes...
Im still waiting for a yoshi or waluigi theory
Peach is not Mario's girlfriend. She rejects the way Mario and Bowser BOTH display possessive tendencies over her and goes on vacation with her friend (Tiara).
The link to download TikTok you have in the description is only for Apple. Luckily, it's not too hard to find the Android download elsewhere
9:07 
teens have entered the chat
Will you analyze Mario Maker 2 so that we can get an even bigger number then the MarioPlex?
ur voice cracka are so cringy xD
0:06 haha nicobbq reference
the power of the moon, in the palm of my hand
I don't get why people are so offended on the tic tock sponsorship. I personally never downloaded musically or now tic tock, but I know plenty of people who enjoy it. Why can't people just let others enjoy what they enjoy without judging.
Already have tictok but when I get to you I can't see anything on it.
3:31 This is exactly how I felt about a certain Subrosian in Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons back when I was a kid.  You're going around trying to collect rupees, ore, rings, and pieces of heart, and this guy is just throwing it all into a tiny pit of lava for fun...
Matpat you need to do more fallout theories please!!!
Hey can you try doing something about sally face it's a very strange game
Do a Yoshi theory saying that Yoshi is the most dangerous creature in the Mario Universe. Also, I'm a composer, so can feature a reference to one of my pieces. Thanks!
why tik tok u memer have failed but still love ur content it is oky doky artachoky
I just noticed that Kirby and other Nintendo character's have blue eyes like the moon's and stars.
yo matpat, so, I'm doing the gateway thing and, I think there is something wrong, I'm putting in the factually correct answer for gate 1 key 3c, but it isn't working right.
Ahh. I see how, since the moons have no power, they could easily melt Marios face off to the bone.
hey MATPAT do a Plants vs Zombie vid on the bucket head zombie
Matpat better not sing hit or miss on TikTok
MATPAT how come jack Jack has the powers of all the other supers that elastagirl met in incredibles 2... Is she cheating???????????


 vid idea
This was a cool video I wish I caught it as soon as it posted
It's doesn't feel like power!!
try and say new dong 5 times fast
My head is gonna explode. My parents think that I cant learn anything on YouTube. But I just did
CAN YOU PLZ MAKE A MINCRAFT THEORY ABOUT THE FLOTING ISLANDS AND THE UNDER WATER PLACES IM CONFUSED!!!!!
I also converted the 33.36 gigawatts into multiples of 1.21 jigawatts.  Using sig figs, it fuels just under 27.6 flux capacitors.
I would love to see a video that's a compilation of all the theories that are too short to make one full video. Just a thought.
2:52 rampage reference I have an arcade of it
Ok but heres a question:
Could peach use tiara to capture creatures?
That still doesn't explain the process by which the Oddessy harnesses them. If it works anything like New Donk City Power Generator there's no way that amount of power would be enough. I'd rather there be some research on THAT. The hat race basically made a ship that can leave earth's atmosphere and return no problem
Hey MatPat, I think you should check out the Danganronpa games... and anime ..... and books. That game has a lot of things you can theorize, specialy if you havent played It already
But arent grand stars more powerful than regular stars? And if so should not power moons be less powerful than grand stars too? Since power moons take the shape of normal stars in the mushroom kingdom
Please mor√© bendy
15:00 :(




jk
Do a theory on the binding of Isaac afterbirth+
Plot twist the moons were really cheese
IT's UNDER 9,000!!!!
Yay! Earthbound reference!
He actually got a drum role!! holy crap this calls for celebration WE NEED A CLAP AND A HALF:0
I went to TikTok and watched your riddle video about the money and was wondering if there‚Äôs a way to find out if I got the answer right
Or do they?

*hey Michael, Vsauce here*
I'm all ready subscribed but I'll give a like.7:03
You were sponsored by Tick Tock? Well, I was going to subscribe....
if you had to assume so much why put out the video in the first place? come on man.
I didn‚Äôt get this in my sub box
Nnnoooooooo......you betrayer.....first Mr.beast and now you......disgraceful........I'm disappointed in you Matty patty......I'm still going to watch your videos as a punishment for your wrong doing.
Can you make a theory about a new game known as pikuniku about maybe the beast/wild pike or the about the person who wants to give people free money!
you lost me when the word math came out of your mouth. great video thoughüëçüèº
In Nintendo direct the purple egg at the end of the update trailer is also in links awakening. Theory
How about bells from Animal Crossing?
Plot twist!
Moons and stars are snicker bars except the moons were bitten.
I like how he‚Äôs mesuring a star and gets into population
Do a theory on analyzing the new Zelda game
Dear god, even matpat can't stay clean of tictok's horror, we need to build a firewall
I'm just thinking about sailor moon
Shaggy could power the whole city with less than 1% of his power.
15:44 SERIOUSLY MATPAT , SERIOUSLY ?  Of all the possible sponsors you HAD to choose TIK TOK !
I submit a theory idea: Danganronpa. Any of them, although tackling the scientific viability of the Great Tragedy would be great!
Where's the part two of Super Smash Bros Ultimate!? We need to give Sakurai his own number!
33.36 Giggawatts. GREAT SCOTT!.
Matpat... The more concerning thing about power stars/moons is not their actual power content, but that they're probably somewhat sentient based on how Rosalina refers to them in Super Mario Galaxy. That power plant in NDC MIGHT be murdering a sentient creature by the second. I mean, they even have eyes!
39,800m but you forgot to say squared mat Pat
i'll burn my subscription after that tiktok
you .. you made an account for tiktok?
you are a massive disappointment.
matpat, could you do a theory on how exactly do people in resident evil 2 turn into the specific zombies that you see in the game pls?
"Can you complete this video without touching any coins?"
Damn I keep accidentally touching pennys.
You guys really should make a theory on Metro, about the Dark Ones, they said they will return, at the end of Metro Last Light, or about Khan, he is quite an interesting character.
Wait if theirs helium and helium III, what happened to helium II
Why can‚Äôt I subscribe multiple times?????
They don't have the Game Theory intro anymore?! DAMN YOU ARTICLE 13?!?!?!
M A R I O  M A K E R  2  !
OH NO
I just saw Einstien Rosalina...wow...I have now seen everything.
MatPat why TikTok plz stop
Hi MatPat! You're probably not gonna see this, but I'm currently studying physics and astronomy, and when you started taking about spectroscopy I was so excited! You did a great job with it!
(Cool side note that wasn't relevant to the video but is related to the spectroscopy of stars, galaxies, and any other known object or system that emits radiation: those emission and absorption lines will often appear shifted towards the bluer or redder end of the spectrum, and measuring these shifts allows us to determine if and how fast an object in space is mixing towards or away from us, due to our understanding of the Doppler Effect!)
Yeah but they look cool.
I have a theory matpat, a spongebb war
Those blurry lines at 0:27 look kinda thicc
Apparently Scott the woz is higher on trending for gaming
This has already been uploaded
I think you were a couple calculations short of a complete theory. I would have liked to see a calculation with how much energy a moon's worth of Helium 3 has to see how much power is available at maximum efficiency. It would also be cool seeing how that compares to the power they're actually getting out of the moons in New Donk City. I also wonder if the "used" moons out the other side of the generator still have colored sparks, which would mean they're getting the energy from something else in the moons and leaving the helium as waste.
is this game theory or math classü§î
Nooooo I touched a coin how did you know matpat
New donk city could have been running on reserve power built up by the power moons.
Can you make a theory on Far Cry 5 about the Bliss that the cult's uses.
Now I can finally read my electric bill
Ladies and gentlemen we lost our hero to that wretched thing known as tik tok
To all you destiny fans, what if the taken King was never really dead. Think about it, he killed the queen and that lead uldren to seek the barens. Like if you want this to be a video
I would bet my bottom dollar that you constantly have dreams about the theories you research.
Too many fortnite videos, now a tiktok sponsorship. Why has the channel fallen so far D: , I'll check back on the channel in a few months but this is too much

OH GOD NOT TIKTOK
So pink Floyd solves this theory? The irony of the song "Another brick in the wall".
does this mean you can power a fridge from just the food within?
Power moons are not that powerful but then how does a power star in most games turn mario invincible
16:51 Mat Patt:when they asked  if i wanted to give Tick Tock a try i said "Heck No nope where just not gonna do it ok nope!!!"
See how strong heavy is
You need to do an episode on the true power of the zapfish from Splatoon.
KirüÖ±Ô∏èy says sorry
Hi Game theory I am a big fans on your YouTube channel and I have some character at you should make a game theory video. You should fo the Broodal

Hey Matpat, did u kno their making Super Mario Maker 2? Better get ready for another theory (maybe)
I love these kind of videos ^^
Do these game developers on purpose include these small details so that Mat can make a theory that will tell game's 7 sequels
Matt would make the best teacher for schools.
There was a lot of twists in that episode 8/10
I challenge you to duel ü§∫ mat
And thus... I am never coming back to this channel


First the damn gamer support debacle and now tiktok???

Yeah no, these theories have been pretty lack luster, neither of us will miss the other but I will wish you luck with your future and family Mat. These have been good times, but they're over now.
No they got matpat with the tik tok
Do a theory on Kenshi!
You should do a cod zombies theory!
can u do my math homework
MattPatt should play danganronpa and do a game theory, how about dat?
No Intro!!!!!! #BlameJason
I thought 1 cal ‚âà 4 J ?
do a theory on apex legends
Do how much a lego stud is actually worth in game
Hey can I eat a power moon for a snack?
i‚Äôm sorry
but not even you can make me download tik tok
Got a Morgz ad





Great
No matpat why did you sponsor the thot place
11:45 tHAt iS nOT coRREcT. hOthEADs dO NOt SHoCK!
I would just like to say, you could qualify for a math and any form of science teacher....wow my science teacher doesn't even teach me this stuff.


 Science teacher: Do you remember we have a science project today? Did you even study?
 Me: No cuz I was busy watching The game theorists.
 ST: Who are they?
 Me: let me give you all an amazing source of knowledge and how someone paid attention in class to use their brain for this amazing thing.
 Everyone: yus no boring t- wow...
i can watch without getting any coins cuz I'm broke
Who needs school wen deres GT
MatPat is trying to redeem TikTok
1:18 I just jumped
you helped me get a fridge
8:20 whats per square meter?
I wonder how much college Matt went through, and like... what his degree level is, and what he studied? Yk?
Do a theory on Apex legends
If anybody deserves to just relax and have fun, it's you. Never thought I'd install TicToc, but, here I am. I need to see some fun, too. I got a call this morning that my Mom had a stroke. I am stuck in Texas, because I have to take care of my children, and she is in Ohio. I feel completely helpless. Thank you for your videos to help pull me through this unspeakable time.
Yo Mat Pat Mario Plex is about to get bigger with Mario maker 2!!
Tiktok, not even once.
Why has matpat lead us to the evil land that is TikTok?
Hey mat what if you actually play the games you make theories of
Oh God mattpat has sold his soul to tik tok
MatPat as a TikToker? 
Well that's new
Dem Jigawatts.
Kirby is adult 5 5
Matpat Tik Toked us.
we lost him to tik tok
I like your video but did you know that tik tok stolen a part of a video from someone called tempex without permission they used it in a ad
Honestly, i'm so much less excited when you try to sell me "merch" instead of selling me "cool pants".
Why is no one remembering mario galaxy 2 which was wayyy better than 1 and made my childhood. It's so underrated compared to galaxy 1
When are you gonna make a Detroit: Become Human theory? Im waiting
Do mario the music box arc
Day 273: Still trying to get MatPat to Like my Comment....
im still waiting for that bioshock theory
Please do a sea of thieves game theory
ITS A TIK TOK AD
Matpat NO, why did you have to give in to TikTok? They are the enemy!
The moons don't power the spaceship, they give the spaceship bigger sails so it can go further. And then go back without needing more moons because the sail is already big enough
I would sub more than once if I could. This much math over a game is just mind blowing.
I‚Äôm learning a lot an energy üòÖüòÖ
like the fact that he didn't say anything about the M.A.R.I. in the Mario world title shows the 4 colors that are used in the elements that make up specific colors used in the spectrum for the sun
Having TikTok as a sponsor is so disappointing
I hate TikTok but I want the merch, however as I‚Äôm not allowed to get the app, my hatred for it is soothed, but my want for the merch is sad...oh well
Hey, why do you think Cuddle team leader has a broken heart on her stomach?
Mat pat is the only person i will let slide being connected with matpat
Im racin mah brain as to which popular trend matti is exploiting with this video
Damnit...now I have to get a tiktok
The power moons contain tiny fragments of Shaggy. That is where the power is coming from.
uh....actually one calorie is like 4.184 joules. It's the energy you need to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.... that's why we measure food energy by the thousands (kcal-kilocalories). 1 kcal=1000calories. kilo is a prefix that means 1000 times.
Hi matpat i was wondering if you could do a theory on titanfall 2? For example who is marvins owner
I honestly was one of your fans but you‚Äôve just lost me at the goddamn word of tick tock
Back to the future!!!!!!!!!
You do realize that a snickers bar has more energy than a stick of dynamite. The dynamite however, is much more destructive since it real its energy must faster. A dynamic has about 1MJ of energy meaning that if the power moon sealed all of its energy at once it would be able to create an explosion about 1.7 times as powerful as that of a stick of dynamite. This means that New Donk City could actually be harnessing the Kinetic energy from the explosion instead of the energy from the moon itself.

Idk I could be wrong but this makes sense in my mind
Fall back everyone the tik tok has contaminated matpat theres nothing we can doüò´ i still like game theory thoe
When are you going to make a theory on 'Hello Neighbor Hide and seek'?
Hey the fact that helium three is found on the moon is another part of proof that the kingdom is in danger from their moon considering the power moons look to have it
Everytime i see the image from the poewer plant it remind me of secret of evermore somehow .....
7:39 Who else immediately thought of the flux capacitor, and then was surprised a few seconds later?
10:51 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah I went on for way to long here
The power moons are offended and are showing Uno reverse cards. You shouldn't have done that, MatPat.
The sun with the neon filytr is black to. Like if agree
Maybe the power cable was underground
Is it just me or did this video feel.. Awkward
10 acres is the same size as the property I live on.
0:06 yo mat is such a liar I survived the video without touching a coin. get roasted mat!
15:40

I am disgusted but intrigued
Do a theory on how fast chuck from the angry birds movie can run
Im really wondering if Nintendo puts those numbers and details in the games to drive theorists crazy it is just pure coincidence...
You should do a video on vampyr
Matpat plees I want you to react to smg4 he makes funny Mario animation plees do it I want to see your reaction of smg4
This is very educational.
has someone tried using the measurements in luigis balloon world to find marios height
9:26  I'm eating icecream right now, but now I don't want to ahaha
funny thing is, when I saw the power moon reactor in the city, I did think to myself, "well efficiency of a reactor does come into play, modern nuclear reactors leave a large chunk of the energy of nuclear fuel unused, despite the immense power output it still gives, that's not it's full potential" and then MatPat said that humans may not know/understand how to properly harness the energy
0:06 I was just flipping a coin
Ok so my favorite video game (Super MARIO Galaxy) has a nuclear reactor and is harvesting energy from stars to power machines sounds like it will attract a lot of spikey turtles
okay, but considering the amount of energy required for a previously defunct spacecraft to break earth's orbit would've been a good thing to talk about here too.
Why are you looking at Why are you looking at Waluigi‚Äôs opposite‚Äôs red Wario
Matpat we need a final fantasy theory
Do a theory about Polytopia
The food comparison is not really a useful analogy. Shoulda' talked about household generators. The household usually doesn't need more than 6500 watts. At 1.7 Megawatts, you can power 261 homes. Amounts to about 200 gallons of gasoline per hour.
Since mario maker 2 is coming out, matpat should see how many different types of levels you could make their, marioplex 2
#SubscribeToGT
Oh god..... OH GOD..... OH NO........
some times i think these videos are just high school classes (this is a fact for me)

Dad jokes in 2060
9:25 ‚Äú1 calorie > 4000 joules‚Äù is not correct, it should be ‚Äú1000 calories (1 kcal) > 4000 joules‚Äù.
Sadly the physics is more complicated than you show. Mechanical energy isn't a lot and 4 perspective Usain Bolt would probably only use 19 kilojoules assuming he's doing a hundred yard dash in 10 seconds and has a final velocity of 10 meters per second.
POWER STAR....well actually the POWER MOON..which can open doors?
I'm just waiting for that one guy who gets a pin and a heart from MatPat cuz their commentary is always interesting
They should have used thorium. It is over all better than uranium and is definitely a better power source than those moons
Mayro, we made it
Watts per year??? Watts is Joules per second.  so are you describing an increase in power?  the way you ure units so badly (other videos too) makes me distrust your maths.
i didnt touch a coin xD
1.21 gigawats, 1.21 gigawats!!! Doc, what the hell is a gigawat
hey mat pat, random question, if the FNAF movie comes out will you do a game theory or a film theory on it?
My question has been answered on 9:45, what is a watt... *cough cough*... That is a poor joke
mat you have forsaken us with tiktok
That‚Äôs forced fusion
The real question is...
Just How powerfull are the Powermoons?

 Is Luigi x Peach a thing?
You do know that the balloon of the oddyssey becomes gold when you het a 1000 power moons and to create solid gold needs a really big amount of energy, do if you calculate the amount of gold then put it in energy divide it by a 1000 and boom you know how much energy a power moons van produce
Stop making Gray Area references.
they are making a fnaf movie for 2020 so... yeah
The moons Aren‚Äôt gas, they make the sail for the oddessy
I think that bit at the start was a reference to either Gamechamp3000 or CeaveGaming.
Also sponsored by TikTok why?...
And where's the intro?
This video feels kinda wierd without the intro, it feels like you got to the science too fast.
Please do Sally face
the only question remaining is when luigi gets to be a villain, and you get to play as him.
Never mind. It was fake :(
Mat pat you forgot the intro ;(
Me: This was a really cool theo-
(Sees TikTok sponsor)
Alright I'm done defending you. Bring on the haters!
do theory on film theory about how elastagirls organs would be crushed.
Like if seeing MatPat talk good about TikTok is cringeworthy
Can we just bury the whole Mario is a psycho theory deep underground now please? Thanks.
What is with Super Mario Galaxy 2 ?
It is amazing how Mat can go from boiling hatred to geeky enthusiasm in just a few days!
my friend is telling me to get Tic Tok
YES, YES IT DOES DESERVE A SUB...   BUT ALREADY SUBBBED...  :(
No no no no tiktok
That Rosalina-into-Einstein transition is going to stalk me in my nightmares.
Ha, Matt Pat did you hear about Mario Maker 2 coming later this year, looks like you‚Äôll have to recalculate how many Mario Maker levels are possible? Also, I think Mario Makers sequel will greatly surpass the original.
MatPat... I tapped on a Film Theory episode and got a Tiktok ad. I went back here to tell everyone about it and got another Tiktok ad.
When Will u do subnautica?
I‚Äôm one of those 0.0000001% 
that likes original things and don‚Äôt have tik tok
GOD NO, MATPAT, NO TIK TOK!!!!!!!!!!!
Mat tiktok what the heck that‚Äôs a new low for u Matthew patrick
Or you know, from a sci-fi writing perspective, the stars and moons could very well be transdimensional portal fuel plus some sort of stabiliser to insure mario doesn‚Äôt burst into basic particles due to the other universe having different basic forces that hold those particles together.
How much energy do the refridgerators with the touch screens use?
Make a theory on Ra's al Ghul's lazarus pit

Help just Destiny plz
Jesus...
We lost mat to tiktok :(
No! Not tik tok! I cant believe you matpat!
I don't really get tiktok, do you?
He ain't no commie.
You might want to mention that the "Calorie"  measurement used in daily life is technically a kilocalorie or 1000 official calories. The small calorie (cal) and the large Calorie (Cal/kcal), aka the food calorie are two different things in scientific measurement
Why is this so?
Why does the US still use Fahrenheit?
Touch no coins alright bet
I don"t care for tik tok.

im sorry but i will never download tik tok
It was a mistake to eat pizza and watch this. Rosalina Einstein made me spit out my food
You should call your tiktok content "MiniTheories"
"...a literal butt-ton of moons."  Next theory:  How much exactly IS a butt-ton?
I saw your speech and I thought wow I changed the world to me
MatPat you are aware you are going to get made fun of for using tik tok
Do a theory on gw2
Here‚Äôs a little outline for the Smash Video if you ever ACTUALLY DO IT. 

If you can‚Äôt make a Sakuraiplex (or Smashplex), then just account for more variables. 
You can do as little as just accounting for the roster and stages. 
If that isn‚Äôt enough, account for every combination of players from two to eight players. 
If that isn‚Äôt enough, account for CPUs and what level they are. 
If that isn‚Äôt enough, use the Omega and Battlefield forms of the stages, not accounting for Omega Final Destination and Battlefield Battlefield. 
If that‚Äôs not enough, account for the exact stages affected by the stage hazards. 
If that‚Äôs not enough, account for the modes. If it‚Äôs time, account for all the amounts of time. If it‚Äôs stock, account for the options of stock combined with the options of time. If it‚Äôs Stamina, account for the different amounts of Stamina, amounts of time, and amounts of stock with every possible combination.
Account for the Custom Balance. 
Account for the amiibos. 
Account for the Mii Fighters.  
Remember that Mii Fighters can have different combinations of special moves, as well as adjusting the outfits and the colors. 

If you want to go the extra mile, account for the Miis themselves. 

The Mii creation tool on the Switch is actually different than that of the Wii, Wii U, and DS. Since all of these Miis can be transferred to the Switch, accounting for the Mii itself would require the knowledge of the possibility of every console‚Äôs Mii creation. 

Account for every spirit if you want and every combination possible in a normal battle. 


‚Ä¢ Controls for every player.
‚Ä¢ Name of every player. 
‚Ä¢ Brightness of screen. 
‚Ä¢ Language of game. 
‚Ä¢ Sound options of volume of Music, SFX, and Voices. 
‚Ä¢ Equalization of Sounds. 
‚Ä¢ Radar Size and if it appears. 

Keep in mind that if you account for costumes, then no two players can have the same costume. 

When you account for stage hazards, also understand that not every single stage is affected by them. While most are, this will still require extra work. 

So maybe it should be a two-parter.

But will it be bigger than the Marioplex?

Feel free to add to the discussion. 

MAKE IT MATPAT
Lol I have tiktok already
He collects them to sell on the black market
I'm watching this with my kitten and he attacked my phone XD

You should try licensing some of your merchandise to real stores like GameStop.
Memememememe mene
Did you do part 2 of fnaf timeline
Is noone going to point out, that 1.7MegaWATTS per YEAR makes no goddamn sense? Watt is energy per time, so watts per year would be (energy per time) per time. So in formula this means energy over time squared. So you are telling me that New Donk City uses 1.7 * 10^6 / (seconds in a year) Joules / second^2. SECOND^2! This would require not just one or two more timelines, but an entire new time dimension. As you stated yourself, Watt measures throughput of energy. This is independent from any timeframe, because it's a statement about every moment in any given timeframe and in no way changes or is affected by that moment.
 If you would watch you video you might spot a "per year" magically appearing at .
Do an r6 vid
MY PLANT THEORY


So in plants vs zombies garden warfare 2 there is empty spots in both spaces where some one should be but it,s not. In the zombie base it says RIP with a thing in a case. In the plants there is boxes blocking out an empty spaces. Plz make a theory
You  should talk about what the strongest smash move is!
I think you have way too much free time on your hands.
Oh god matpat tik tokplease pray to god
You should do a subnautica theory, because it's a cool game and a sequel is in the works
I have always hated those power moon pipes
where's the intro?
People do too much work for somethings
We lost him in the tic tok meme we will get me next time
Two vids in a few days???! Best YouTuber ever!!!!
Hey MatPat I loved your original Destiny theory video and I was wondering if there was any way that you could do another one since they released The Dark Below, House of Wolves, The Taken King, Rise of Iron, Destiny 2, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and Black Armory since the original video came out? It would be great if you could. I just thought I would ask.
Power moons are duracell batterys
5.
1.7megajoules/second * 1second. Gee! I do sure wonder what the simplifies to!!
Dear matpat I have a quick question are you gonna finish the hello neighbor theory's? I know hide and seek kind of explain it but we still don't know who the shadow man truly is and what happened to the mom and what the basement really means oh and who the man in the picture is. Please like so matpat can see this. Thank you ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫
3.3 billion LED bulbs worth of energy per year? That's what, 5 incandescent bulbs?

I just learned this in science
are the power moons sentient? cause like power stars can turn into lumas. And then if so... about the power generators...
I miss Mario Galaxy :(
We lost another youtuber to tik tok
Mission failed
What if the moons recharge themselves? A tiny star chargers them??
Matpat and the Gang counted all those fictional people to calculate the fictional functionality of moonsüò≠üíó I wish I had their work ethicüòÇ

Edit: I was going through the comments so I could discuss some cool things about the theory and all I saw was hate. What the Hell are you doing here? I'm sorry Matpat uses his time to entertain and teach us and all you do with your time is try to debunk him. Sorry honey but he's using actual science and engineering. You're using fictional made Up science. Either sit back and enjoy or get out of the comments. Not hard at all, sweetcheeks.
I wonder what light mat emits when he‚Äôs excited?
Is there a substance strong as webbing
I much preferred his more lore based episodes. I‚Äôd like to see more of those.
Do more Fortnite
Tiktok lol
Faking out the "But hey, that's just a theory. A GAME theory. Thanks for watching." on top of leaving out in the first place is really terrible of you.
I DO NOT LIKE THIS INTROOO
Hey can you research into the ghost girl in Pokemon games series. It's seems she is in every game . In alpha ruby and sapphire she is seen in the background in one of the final battle. She is seen behind the Trainer.

Hey MatPat, I had a cool idea but don't know if it interests you. In the game "Subnautica" you deal with a virus that infects you and you can slowly watch it take over your body until you cure it with an enzime. You should look at that and possibly do a theory on what the Kahrra Virus is and what possibly Enzime 42 could be on a human standard.
I know this is weird,

But I live in A small Village...


It‚Äôs called KIRBY. 
(The pink think from Nintendo.)
Sorry, Mat, but I spent some time with TikTok and now I can‚Äôt do it anymore. There‚Äôs too much cringe. But I‚Äôll download it and follow you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is it just me, or does Matt always seem to answer the questions that I never thought I had.
WOW. YOU UPLOADED THIS YESTERDAY AND I JUST STARTED PLAYING IT YESTERDAY.
Salad fingers new episode pls
the internet was made for fast transfering of information tho?
NOOOOO, NOT TIK TOK!!!!
Why not do a theory on pony island
Hey uh Matpat, Here's a better Mario Question:

What are Lakitus really, and how do they keep tossing Spinys, Those spiky turtles you cant jump on, seem almost infinite.. Its the same for say Hammer Bros. and their counterparts, having an endless supply of Hammers Boomerangs and other Bros like the Fire & Ice Bros in later Mario Game Series
Calories....or kilo-calories?
Like if he should do mini episodes
1 person! A-a-a 2 people! A-a-a 3 people! A-a-a
matpat can u do a theory about how strong kratoas is and if he can pick up thors hammer plz like if u want that
matpat,
I have a theory for you to do over on film theory if you don't do it its ok but anyway I was thinking if you could find out whether or not the residents of swallow falls can live on sardines (cloudy with a chance of meatballs) again its ok if you don't I just want you to know that I had an idea
But are the moons sentient?
Why are you thinking E X T R A C R I N G E if Tik Tok is already an infinite source of cringe?
i had to dislike. srry. tik tok
TikTok is as common as Fortnite, and just as annoying.
Pls do hollow knight, I know it‚Äôs been out for a while, but pls do it
NOOOOOOoooooo!!!!!!!! TIK TOK BRAINWASHED MAT!!!!!!!!!!
Seeing NateWantsToBattle in this video reminded me of when he was on the charity livestream and I'm curious if he and Matt are actually going to make that diss track thing for reaching the goal?
theirs a ARG secret at 1:43
I‚Äôm concerned, Matt
10:10 The number that is the amount of money Defy Media stole and lied about
These types of theories-- the ones with ridiculously random but awesome bits of data (using the neon filter in a minigame to predict the chemical makeup of an energy source? I mean, seriously!) -- are some of my favorites XD
I have to rebut on the spectroscopy claim. 
1) If you looked at the Sun through a spectroscope, you wouldn't see the Sun -- you'd see (spectral) lines of color. The strongest is not "blue" (Hydrogen-beta) but is red (Hydrogen-alpha). If you want to look at a blue circle in the sky, you would have a hydrogen-beta filter to let that color of light from the Sun through, but everything else would also look blue
2) The spectral lines for helium are 706nm, 588nm, 501nm... and really nothing close to 485nm. In fact, the third brightest line is 688nm. To an engineer, these seem close enough, but to someone who uses spectroscopes, this is very very different than the values you gave. There can be a margin of error given you're taking an eye drop tool on a video game screenshot, but if that error is more than, say, 5nm, it's totally inconclusive as to which element it would be.
3) If we were looking through a spectrometer, the only objects we would be able to see are those that emit light. The Sun? Yeah. But Mario? The trees? Ground? Not in the visible spectrum, and certainly not in those colors. Which leads me to this:
If we think the moons are made of He III, we think this because we are seeing their emission lines -- it's emitting light corresponding to He III. But wait. It's emitting light? This  to mean it's losing energy. How can we assign a given, static (internal potential) energy to the moons and also say we're looking at emitted light i.e. lost energy?  He III is not radioactive, and the virial theorem is not applicable since it's staying the same size. This isn't proving the moons are made of something else, but that the neon filter cannot be used as a spectroscope.


(Also another reason the neon filter is not a spectroscope is because you can see Mario's white gloves. There's no "white" in a rainbow/spectrum)
I can‚Äôt get social media
You guys ruined all of my childhood games but that is fine I enjoy the science a lot
Matpat says ticktok me falls of the couch and dies
IM UNSUBBING CUS OF TIKTOK IM SORRY but.... its also that this channel is getting cringy and your selling out
Mario theory? Must be my 16th Birthday...oh wait.
do an a hat in time theory next
Are they edible ? They look tasty. o_o
Welp I lost
TikTok
Rosalina is a genius.
Honey, where are my moons?
HIS POWER MOON LEVEL IS UNDER 9,000
TikTok is for little children.exe
I‚Äôm concerned about the fact that they have eyes. Are the moons alive? And if so, it‚Äôs super messed up that they‚Äôre used as fuel.
If anyone has a nuclear tummy ache, go ahead consuming five Power Moons.
anyone notice he didnt do the intro?
Just a theory,a game theory
Y no intro?
15:15...
This might be  MUTE POINT, but I feel like it needs to be said. I don't think anyone who is committed to this channel would hold it against the creators if they made make a 4 minute theory, in fact I think a lot of us would enjoy it. 

Most channels make little bonus vids that don't quite stand up to what they make on a regular basis. The little theories Mat says aren't worth  publishing (release to the public) are little tidbits that me and I know many others would enjoy watching. 

It doesn't matter weather a theory is correct, this channel excites the part of our brains that like to think outside the box, the part of us that like solving obscure problems. That being said if any theory is a good theory no matter how small. this channel gives us a reason to peruse thinking about obscure topics which we  wouldn't normally think about had it not been brought up by the theorist team.

If anyone agrees with me in any shape or form please help me be heard by the team. Try to raise awareness for the little projects as well as the more fleshed out theories.
I always love the Mario Theories! :>


Wait? So, the Power Star, when Mario grabs them.. Superstar Mario (When he goes invincible) is actually; a Fusion reaction!? With Mario‚Äôs body!? Giving him energy! To destroy in his path! And, does that mean, Mario is made of helium..? If he can absorb; stars and moons... ‚Äî Oh... ._.
The fanf franchise is never over you never found out who purple guy is
Sooooooo......... how much energy is newdonk city wasting?
I like memes
Hi Matt,


I am big fan of you and I wish you would make a video on the current Poodeepee v/s T Series. I expect that you would notice that while you and other Youtubers are making relevant content and not just reviewing memes but researching and analyzing millions of things to make a video, someone else is continuously gaining subscribers not by making good content, but by begging for subscribers and it is rather shameful and demotivating that other top Youtubers are supporting this unnecessary competition and please also take up on the issue of RACISM behind this situation and the RACIST face of that top Youtuber. I really have high hopes from you Matt. Only if the top Youtubers would have given competition to T Series by coming together to make even more awesome and intellectual content, this situation would have been truly won by content creators even if the numbers did not support them. Remember ROCKY, it's not the numbers that count and not the award a win is when you are people's winner. You are the only one who can take a brave stand on this situation and present honest unbiased and practical review of the current situation.
You get TikTok for something that would be better solved by a GT2 channel?
How powerful are "Psionics" in XCOM2, I didn't know where I could ask and I dunno if this is good material...but it's worth a try, right?
This got me thinking about the many Kong bananas in DK64 are they still bananas or are they peppers plantains etc or is it just food coloring? It‚Äôs probably food coloring.

so an 8 min vid is not long enough to be a theory? classic example of a cash grabber sellout
I awlays thought tiktok was a diease but now its cool
Where's the Intro?
What if certain color moons give us different amounts of energy? Just a thought.
Mario is a fricken god
sorry i touched all the coins
They released a new salad fingers episode
Matpat's a tiktoker now!
Seriously!?!? Tik tok!?!? Wow.
At this point, Matpat's relationship with the Mario franchise is the same as the relationship between Buffalo Bill and that woman he had chained down his basement in Silence of The Lambs
Mario, we meet again...
Love your videos
Nicobbq reference
Person: No one will ever know the answer to X
MatPat: Hold my beer
wouldn't it make more sense that the moons are energy tanks that get recharged by something?  I mean it's like saying you need 5 moon tanks to get from cap kingdom to cascade kingdom.  This would explain why you need a specific amount to travel further each time.
No God damn intro

Oh my god... I‚Äôve missed you... finally I get my iPad back
Hey MatPat! Can you do another theory on Mario Odyssey, because I‚Äôm starting to believe that Cappy is actually a symbiote (like Venom). He shapeshifts and controls others in a similar way.
dammm he is smart
WHY IS THIS SPONSORED BY TIKTOK
Why do I even watch your videos anymore?
I never realized how much effort and genius are put into these videos until MatPat literally pointed it out. Thank you Game Theory for all of your hard work and will to push on for the sake of your fans.üòÅüëèüëè
so its a similar concept to the kamehameha wave bieng a small star like plasma ball but in this case it like funny shapped batteries
TikTok? wtf matpat why?
do a theory on Cool 3D World.
Plz heart my comment
I couldn't watch the whole episode without touching a coin... I touched a quarter.
Matpat Spider-Man‚Äôs ‚Äúdevils breath‚Äù is a actual DRUG called Scopolamine
We lost another one
Hit or miss
thats allot of juul
Why Tik Tok?
ur to late lolz
What ever happened to the zoo level theory
Can we have a theory on why Game theory is becoming worse?


I could say literally any valid argument but I think if you search it up on google you'll find enough, so it's worthless to mention it. And while I have to say that I did like matpat at some point, I realized how he is a sellout and that there are better theorists out there. If you watch his videos (especially the "everybody hates me" videos than you'll realize he behaves like logan paul at a level). Before I end this comment tho I will say that some of his videos are good and he is not all bad, but the way he takes criticism as hate is something I hate about him. Also if you like him I don't care, do whatever you want this comment is already too godamn long
Do a therory on antichamber
Friends: You can't make a meme out of a Game Theory video
Me: does it anyways
Friends: 11:39

That's alot of juuls
Ok ok

Notification Gang where are you?
Boooooooooüò¨
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
I know it is a bit late to post a comment now so next time you MatPat post a video I am going to tell you something that you might not know about DELTARUNE according to it's title, see you next time, if you want to know about it any sooner reply to me your discord
NO PAT TIC TOK IS TOXIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Power Stars=Glorified Keys
Game theory needs to create an ARG
The powermoons in New Donk City are actually being leeched by Bowser to power a super large jet turbine that pushes the Odyssey backwards. Mario must collect powermoons to build his own super large jet turbine to plunk down at whichever location needed. The closer he gets to Bowser, the more moons he needs to overpower the gust being blown at him. When returning to a previous level, he remotely turns off his turbine and allows Bowser to push him back. Mario has no need to refuel the turbine as Rosalina has assisted him in using a controlled trickle of fusion from the moons that would take eons to deplete.
.... 200 watts a year that would cost me a quarter every decade

Good job for trying out Tic Tok even though you knew you might be ridiculed for it being cringe. brave move matpat
Oh no. . . . .we lost another one to Tik Tok. .  . oh well It's Matt so I'll give it a try ^ ^
I expected arsenic's signature to look like a serial killer's or something
And here i was thinkin Mat was gonna create a sub theory series to just give a quick run down on 2-3 theories that didn't make it to the final cut for one reason or another
I love game theory! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Tik Tok
I thought he was gonna tell us that we should suggest the next theory. Just in case he sees this. Fran bow theory. Come on make sense of the lore. No one did anything on it
Tic Toc how dare u
Wait do oxygen stars really exist?
I mean though tik tok is for lip syncing stuff
its never been used for that anyways


so i guess you doing that is okay
MatPat seems to be doing theories less and more 1.7 million dollar lie, article 13 vids. WE WANT THEORIES NOT POTITICS. So keep this up. Also, Salad Fingers
can you do a sally face theory please
I'm waiting for the theory where mat says hat girl is Mario and peaches daughter and Rosalinas half sister (as much as it's probably not true it's cute to think about Mario as a papa)
Can we get a moment of silence for our fallen brother. Taken to soon

WARIO IS 10 FEET TALL
No not tiktok
I think your math is a bit messed up there.
200 watts per year would be 200 joules per second?
That would mean 1watt/yr = 1J/sec
So I looked it up, and the real conversion is 200w = 200J/s


To convert that to an amount of Joules per year, it's actually 31,536,000 seconds * 200 J

That comes out to 2,307,200,000J/yr.
You can't say "watts per year" because a watt is already 1J/s, meaning you would be saying "1 Joule per second per year." Refrigerators do not consume that little of energy. A simple clock will consume 10watts, which is 315,360,000J/yr.


A typical refrigerator actually consumes around 1725watts, which is 54,399,600,000J/yr. Of course, electric companies don't use that number, rather they use kilo-watt hours (kWh), which is a lot easier to calculate. Just take the amount of days, multiplied by 24, multiplied by the amount of watts, then divide it all by 1000. This will get you an average fridge consumption of 15,111 kWh. Luckily, electric companies give their actual rates in kWh, so where I live, in Kansas, it will cost me  $.10677/kWh during the summer, and  $.08243 during the winter. If we take 6296kWh during the 5 summer months, and 8815kWh during the 7 winter months, it comes out to a total of $672.22 + $726.62 = $1398.84/yr. To my surprise, it's actually pretty reasonable.


The problem here is that you're confusing Watts, as they're just a name for "Joules per second."
5:08 We overestimate the output of the Grand Coulee Dam power plant in Washington by assuming it's the only power plant in the world. We know this not to be true, but we can balance it out by assuming it only powers the northern hemisphere. Therefore we can conclude that half the world can easily be powered by a single hydroelectric power plant, solving any environmental or security problems stemming from nuclear or fossil fuel power plants. Where's my Nobel Price?
I'm totally first like my comment i will give you a cookie
Well there is no hope

HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE A THEORY ON LITTLE NIGHTMARES
So, those things either have the power of a candy bar or can be used as a part of a star which basically is one of natures biggest energy sources?

Okay...
I don't really get Tik Tok, do you?
I know this is a weird one, but far cry 5 and new dawn. Where did the rookie go? I got my hunches but I wouldnt mind seeing a minisode or even a full blown one if it gets off the ground. Lots of sciencey what ifs and such.
Psshhh then how come I eat the moon on my burgers and feel powered?
I don‚Äôt know what but something tells me he‚Äôs a little late for this.
says the moons have no power

shows mario getting his face melted off

...I‚Äôm failing to see your point...
Yay math
well the math is wrong
do a fnac theory
What if that machine is just sucking energy from the moons and puts the energy into some sorta storage that the city runs off of
Madpat:make‚Äôs video

Me:STOP EVERYTHING YOUR DOING MADPAT MADE A NEW VIDEO!!!
00:05 wait is that a ceave gaming reference
Why dont you say: "Its just a theory a game theory" anymore? :,(
Tik Tok is sponsoring him noooooo [
9:26 Depends if you mean kilocalorie or calorie. 1 calorie is 4,18 joule but when people say calorie, most of the time they mean kilocalorie.
¬°Hi Matpat! I'm a frequent visitor on your channel, and I can suggest you a real strange game called "Cube scape". It's real weird and creepy. And none of the game is explained... Well, I can't understand it. I would be fascinated if you make a video for this game.
Mat pat, I know the sun has the blue outline, but IT IS JUST A NEON MODE, NOT AN ACCURATE SPECTROMETER! Run the test on random stuff in the game and you will find that method not to work to figure out what stuff is made out of. I mean it is a cool Idea, but that is not going to help you with this. ( Also Hydrogen 3 Isotope is what would be best to use for fusion for us to harness. )
ITS UNDER 9000!!!!
"Little over ten minutes"
0:52 i thought he meant mushrooms
When it comes to power and energy what matters is the speed at wich the energy is used, 1.7 Mjouls or energy can mean the energy of a piece of chocolate cake or a stick of TNT, it dependes on the speed it takes to release the energy.
I just did the math and if a single calorie of food is more than 4000 joules the average woman needs 8 million joules of power per day and the average man needs 10 million joules of power per day.

Excuse me WHAT?
Hi matpat it‚Äôs me Kawaii_sans101
ITS UNDER 9000!
Um..MatPat? Did you know that In Donkey Kong The story was that a gorrila (donkey Kong) escaped from his owner, a Carpenter named Jumpman (Mario).
Basicly this channel is explaining al sorts of physics and other biological measurements but using them to understand a videogame which is supremely amazing because you get to know about gaming biology math and quantum physics ... secrtetly game theory is just school but uses games for an example and that is why i suscribed
Keep up the good work btw please make a bioshock big daddy suit theory

Do another petscop theory
Just please get to a point that you can influence tiktoks advertising strategy and convince them not to over re-target the same audience with the ads. The ads are the biggest reason why everyone hates tiktok, just relentless re-targeting and poor content display choices (the cosplay community would have been much better ad faces for example, they've been doing well on the platform)

From the look of the empty husk that comes out the other side, I would also say that they are rechargeable. That is unless somewhere in the game you find a landfill full of used power moon corpses, yes I meant corpses because they have eyes.
9:10 you should have made an all stars joke why mat pat.....

MR. MATPAT! I have ONE thing to state that you DIDN'T do! You did a game theory on Doki Doki Literature game the "first dating game to actually have an amazing story" - Which this is wrong! Mystic Messenger was the first dating Sim game to actually have an AMAZING story! And it indeed had creepy vibes just like Monika, in fact now that I think about it, Mystic messenger might've influenced Doki Doki a lot from the two stories.
CAN WE PLEASE LIKE THIS SO MISTA MAT PAT CAN SEE!
Digo sub :v
stop watching at 15:30
Why are Stars not drawn round but drawn, well starshaped how did this come to mind???
How powerful are in powerstars?
The unit conversion seems wonky here. Matt appears to have used watts interchangeably with watt-hours, a common and easy mistake to make. But a watt-hour is 3600 joules, meaning every moon contains 3600x more energy than what Matt calculated. Still not nuclear face-melt territory, but much more believable as magical fuel.
At least he`s a gamer...  right
Can you win any Mario game without touching a coin? Who‚Äôs hyped for Mario Maker 2?
The thing I love about these videos is that Mat Pat debunks things that we don't see at first, realize, or understand. Then at the end of the video we realize how we didn't see that and how compelling it is to break down little details into a tremendous and revealing plot or mechanic. Then we all go and brag what we found or learned.üòÅüòÅ

How about a theory on the physics of Dumbo?
Another way that the power moons could work is that is powers up the NAVIGATION system in the Odyssey, thinking about this, the Odyssey could be powered by flight, it just needed the power moons to power up the navigation, giving the ship somewhere to go.

So I may have not heard this correct but you showed doctor Mario as a scientist
Your assuming that the powerplant is effectively using the energy generated. Energy sources tend to have wasted energy that we cant use. So they may generate way more energy than you calculated.

Guys, Matthew had WHOLE PAYCHECKS squirreled away by a now extinct Ponzy scheme company. He has a wife. He has a NEW CHILD. He needs to take care of them, and if accepting a sponsorship from Tik Tok can help him do that, then good for him for jumping on the opportunity, regardless of public opinion. At least Tik Tok is a legitimate thing.

We love you, Matt. Give Defy Media and Ally Bank hell.

Hey can you check out the game  "modern combat versus"? in an app on PC for windows but its actually a pretty fun shooter, I have a theory that "voice: that gives us orders is controlling both sides and making us fight for unknown reasons, i think you could figure it out.
yay you said speedrun.
Matt one question, have you figured the fuel efficiency of the New Donk generator vs Mario's mode of transportation? For example, something like a new 5.7 Chevy engine is much more fuel efficient than a 350 Chevy engine from the 1970s, even though they are similar in size and have a similar capacity of fuel. Just was curious about that.

Hey Matt Pat, do you have any theories about Metal gear rising : revenge? Neko is really curious about why combat data is in the left arm. Neko also don't completely understand much about the "HF sword" Raydin /  "jack the ripper" uses. Can you and the Game Theorists please make a video about it?
You know a meme is dead when matpat uses it.

When he said joules, I thought he meant juuls and then I thought that he said the power of 200 juuls could fuel a refrigerator. That made me feel uncomfortable..

The next instine , but he‚Äôs a gamer, and has a girlfriend. And is younger
I like how he dropped joules to go for watts only to go back to joules a couple of minutes later.
UHH DAE a calorie is actually about 4,2 joules, however food energy is usually measured in kilo calories, which means 1000x calorie so one kilocalorie is about 4200. So while you are almost correct you missed a small detail.
I'm genuinely sorry Matpat, I couldn't help myself. Obviously you know what you're talking about and I have much respect for the theorist crew, but like I said. I couldn't help myself getting caught up in your linguistics ;). Keep up the good work guise
NO MATPATT
Why do you like Tik tok it‚Äôs just lip singing to memes or just making them
no intro?
Diet theories?
TIK TOK IS A MEME STEALER. Also, it makes bad memes
Great episode Mat, but I am so much happier that you FINALLY got a drumroll worthy drumroll.

1) Yay!! A theory with chemistry! Now I can use it as a potential extra credit for my students (I'm a high school chemistry teacher). 

2) I agree with a lot of comments below. It would be cool to have some of those shorter theories. Again, especially as an educator I'd love to use some quick 5 minute theories as bell ringers in my class. 

3) And lastly, biggest twist in this video was honestly the Tik Tok sponsorship at the end lol.
Interesting, but what about when Mario uses them turn invincible temporarily? Possibly grounds for another theory video?
I haven't watched the video yet, so i hope there is no maths on it

Film Theory: How old is Spongebob?
MatPat, I have an alternate idea for this theory, TL;DR is simply, the power plant you need to fix for the festival isn't the only power plant for the city, it is the Peak demand supply generator. 

I haven't personally played Super Mario Odyssey so I don't know the full context of the mission other than what you described in the video but, if the festival cannot take place because the generator was needed to supply peak demand rather than full city energy the power moons would have a much higher energy per moon rating. 

In case you don't know, peak demand as described by wikipedia is: 
Peak demand, peak load or on-peak are terms used in energy demand management describing a period in which electrical power is expected to be provided for a sustained period at a significantly higher than average supply level. Peak demand fluctuations may occur on daily, monthly, seasonal and yearly cycles. For an electric utility company, the actual point of peak demand is a single half-hour or hourly period which represents the highest point of customer consumption of electricity.
Power stations providing power to electrical grids for peak demand are called peaking power plants or 'peakers'. Natural gas fueled power stations can be fired up rapidly and are therefore often utilized at peak demand times. Pumped storage type dams such as Carters Dam in the U.S. state of Georgia help to meet peak demand as well.

This would explain why the city has power enough for the billboards and lights you see but not enough for the festival to take place, Mayor Pauline knows that if the festival takes place without the Peak demand generator being online they will either go over their power production demands and have brown outs or black outs, or they will be forced to buy peak demand power from the grid which is expensive.
Those 5 peeps who dis-liked this video are people who dont believe in these awesome thoery's . (Lel i cant spell :/ )
Oh no, not.. TIKTOK! THE WORST APP EVER!

Considering the backlash from the TikTok sponsorship (Just typing that made me cringe) I doubt that many people will be downloading TikTok because of its appearance in this video
Loved the video see you on tiktok

Matpat ya gotta do a video on Hollow Knight! So much to theorize!
15:43 weeze üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I can't get tiktok
Srry
Just here to say that power and energy are two different things and you can't say watt is a unit of energy. Also when talking about energy consumption it's power*time not power/time so a concept of 1.7 megawatts/year is completely wrong. Imagine you have a 1 kW electric kettle. That's power and it's time-independent. You need a time-based perspective to know how much energy it will consume and - you guessed it - the longer it will be turned on the more energy it will consume, not the other way around.
Better get ready MatPat... mario maker 2 is coming in june and im counting on you to see how limitless this one is too!
1:08 they are steroids
if that is the case it's even more conerning that the moons are quite literally placed on a conveyer belt before harvesting - if some of them collide and it causes a nuclear meltdown fusion will be possible and the world will be consumed by nuclear fire, perhaps creating a small star.
4:18 or maybe they have batteries....capacitors?
Watts/year is a bad unit, a watt is a measure of rate of power usage, it's Jules/second, the unit's for Watts per year would then have to be Jules/(second^2), but then that's crazy because why are you measuring a rate of change in power consumption?

I really think you need to start having someone with a basic knowledge of science and/or engineering check this stuff first, when your units don't make sense you've done something wrong and need to go back and figure your mistake before you can continue(and in this case you incorrectly converted BTUs to Watts rather than MWh(the amount of energy in one million Watts when supplier for one hour).

iron skies is a great, dark toned movie, but seriously its about nazis on the moon. anyway the main fuel they use for their spacehips is helium 3 which they mine on the moon because they are hiding on the dark side of the moon. i guess the movie makers also did trheir there research huh.

7:04 I don't watch enough of your videos to make a subscription worth while. I also don't care to watch your uploads moments after they are uploaded.
Well done for #9 of trending In gaming ,love ur bids like
I was watching out of fullscreen, so I never touched a coin.

I think you going from your original measurement to another method, saying you were trying to "back it up", before getting a very different, albeit helpful, measurement and not really bringing it back to your original claim as support, is a bit odd. The idea that all or even most of the helium in a power moon would be helium III comes off a bit strange as well, but it's mostly good.

There's not really any unit that's "watts per year". Most ideas I have for what it could mean in this context don't change the math, though, namely ideas of average wattage and watt years.
Excuse me Matthew those are diet theories, or game theory lites
2:11 incorrect time displayed as 2:01 and video ends at  17:49 not 16:45.
Now we need how much power do the super emerald chaos or master emerald
From what I can tell, the New Donk City Power Plant may actually be recycling those Power Moons, replenishing their energy spending less than is used - creating a surplus of electrical power to sustain the area of the kingdom involved, and the only reason for requiring so many Power Moons in the generator would be to increase the rate of production. 
 
This idea of cyclical energy production can also explain how devices within the Mario franchise seem to only get better as more Stars/Moons/Shines go into them without ever seeming to run out. It's like the infinite energy held by Sonic's Chaos Emeralds, except with a limiter cap on how much energy can be drawn out each second - the more magic maguffins you use, the more power you can access at a time - and not everyone knows how to take that power without draining extra resources from them, that need to be replaced so they can be recycled.

Can you watch this video without killing an enemy?
15:15 wait why‚Äôd you stop I was interested
HEY RESPECT MATPAT! JUST BECAUSE HE WAS SPONSERED BY TIKTOK AND FORGOT TO MAKE AN INTRO DOESNT MEAN YOU GET TO HATE HIM!
He's still a human being just like is and we all have our own interests, respect his, no one is perfect ok? Its his life not yours if you dont wanna watch him, ok its your loss, you'll never know the answer to your questions about games and movies again. So if you made a bad comment, just delete it, if you have nothing good to say, just keep your mouth shut. Ive seen him stressed, Ive seen his undertale video part 2, just delete all your negative comments right now and if you make a negative reply, then ok fine by me. Just delete your negative comments. And make MatPat's life less worse.
Oh no MatPat, not you too
All the edgy nerdy teenagers freaking out that Game Theory decided to take a sponsorship from Tik Tok is hilarious.
TikTok be like...

What about about Did You Know Gaming,
I am Did You Know Gaming.
Can I be Film Theory,

Can I be GT Live,

I'm not gonna be Stephanie.
You atcgily got good sound effects!  Yay, good drum roll.
The Power Moon and Star are very powerful they can power cities and more
Considering everyone just gets spawned in in New Donk this information isn't valid IMO lol
Doing isotope calculations then heard isotope Helium- 3
I'm not angry for Matt for accepting the Tik Tok sponsor. The only thing that I'm disappointed is that this video doesn't have the intro.
i love how every comment is about NOT hating on matpat using tik tok as a sponcer


even thogh i see none hating on him in  the first place
I just unsubbed because of tiktok X( matpat is #sellout
Confirmed, matpat is a tiktokker.
Why are people mad about the TikTok sponsorship? In all honesty, he handled it better than any other youtuber who has been sponsored by them. Instead of just a "oh hey, do this thing. I'm on it too, I swear", he turned it into a mini-game with riddles and mini-theories, and ALSO turned it into a sweepstakes. 
He handled it pretty well. Even if you despise TikTok, you gotta give him props for using a dumb platform in a pretty well-done way. 

Also... ya'know, he's in the middle of legal nonsense with the whole Defy nonsense, and has to pay out of pocket for it... while caring for a newborn. So it's all cool if he wants to take the sponsorship.
I don‚Äôt really get TikTok, do you?
The other thing is that the power moons also bust out of Moon Stones at the end of the game when Cappy hits them. Which also verifies the Helium III composition and the fact there are on the moon. Why is Nintendo so good at lore????
Just finished this episode without touching a coin.  Easy
This Video Is Sponsored By TikTok


Guess this is the first video from Game Theory ill ever dislike
Why is Mario collecting moons? Eggman pissed on the moon
ohhhh nooooo nott tik tok not you too matpatttttt
13:37 - What if I told you that these colors are just the four iconic Super Famicom colors?
See also Luigi's Balloon World. As you continue to participate, he gains more balloons to float with.
When he has all three, they're red, yellow, and blue, with Luigi himself making up for the green.
Nintendo uses these colors a lot, usually as a clever nod. See also the colors of Yoshi found in Super Mario World.
What about efficiency, maybe power moons lose some of their power in the process and are actually way more powerful.
Try doing a angry birds video

Do a red dead theory on the strange man
Oh yeah yeah
Im hyped
This is awesome, I am honestly baffled by how clear you make it sound. The theory seems to be logical from every angle, and I have never seen anything even remotely similar from anyone else. Honestly, I can't believe superhumans like you even exist. Awesome work.
Sponsoring by TIK-TOK... MatPat why out of all the sponsors why???
Tik tok really! Unsub from Matt. Nah jk. Keep up the good content.
when are you releasing a 2nd major puzzle game thingy?
I'm happy you always make it relatable.

Hey matpat u ever notice that in the pokemon i choose u movie the old man has a hat nearly identical to trainer reds hat in the game i find that very interesting
Hey MatPat. Since you've done a theory on how zombies could be created, could you do a Left 4 Dead theory on how the survivors could become carriers of the T-virus and not be affected by it, no matter how many times they are bit, and have never been exposed to it before?
Matpat can you be my math tutor
Mat pat go to new Donk pause the game and read the section in the bottom left.

Geez good job matpat! You do this all for us (even though some people don't get it üòÇ) but still good job!
You're not going to do the math on how many joules of energy a moon of that size would contain, based on pixel measurements? :(
This, of course, assumes that the machine that takes in the moons and de-powers them is efficient and doesn't require an intense amount of energy to power it in the first place. 
Which brings me to a VERY important question- do the machines that make batteries have to pay an electric bill, or do they run on batteries?
15:50 He's gone boys. There's nothing you can do to save him.
Love your vids can Please have your merch
I see more people in the comments complaining about people hating MatPat for using TikTok as a sponsor than people actually hating MatPat for using TikTok as a sponsor.

10:29 Just a quick correction, the reference intake of an average adult is of 2000 kcal, not cal, that is, 2000 kilocalories and not 2000 calories.
(2000 kcal= 2,000,000 cal)
Edit:Per Day of course
I have an idea for you about the new pokemon meltan the pokedex says that meltan eats metal and meltan's head is metal so does it mean meltan is a cannibal?

Mat pat please do a "PUBG theory on what the circle is and why the islands are all abandonded and why they have guns evry where and busted up cars and planes" pleeeaaaseee it will be sooooo awsome and nice.
Your theories too fun and to believable to be ignored
I hate "Tik Tok!!!!!!"
12:37 hey look it's the French flag
9:25 which calorie? The Calorie or calorie? I presume Calorie?
Dude your on tiktok!?! I thought about making fanart for you guys but don't know what. Got any ideas?
Filthy frank has infinite power, just ask him to help you and you can do anything.
hey MatPat! New Salad Finger episode! Episode 11! New theory yet?
Was that a Fermi Approximation you put in my Mario Video?
How much healium-3 are in them and how much would that produce in a working fusion reactor then?
Make a theory on how tall tyler1 is
Mat i love you but I feel bad for you that everyone hates you for your tictok spon
Why make trillions when we can make mega joules mwahaha
I am wearing your merch while watching
I‚Äôm still confused how you haven‚Äôt done silent hill 2 yet? It‚Äôs is theorist dream game. I love you still mattpat but get to it! Great theory.
they give power and fuel dummy
1 calories = 4,2 joules
isnt that the Chrysler buiding?
I love ir videosssssss!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
MatPat you just described tiktok as a fun time. I think you're thinking of something else
I miss ronnie
At this point nintendo should hire mat pat for their lore
0:04 - With demonetization, you can watch it without touching a coin!
Only 650 dislikes? This is sponsored by tiktok, cmon
I was about to make a comment about you being wrong about something,and then realized you capitalized the C in Calorie which is not the same as calorie. Carry on with thine theory
How did you look at sun.
Roses are red 
Violets are blue
This is original so don't copy it or you're a peepeepoopoo
Unfortunately i cannot subscribe right now I'm already subscribed
YOU ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE POWER OF SNICKERS
Me eating a bowl of spaghetti: I will power New York City all on my own
2:11, you missed a minute
Shake my head, thought Matt would not fall to tik tok hell smart as he is!!
Welp, this channel has become part of the demon app that has too many ads, time to leave
Why arent you a science professor?
So that ad at the end was just May saying "life us hard alright I need the money"
Yay another meme
So when are we gonna get a Slenderman theory? Curious
They could also be more valuable because they might be a renewable energy source. Since it's implied that moons, stars, and shine sprites are the same material, that could also mean that the actually moon or star is just a plastic-like casing (like the drained moons) that protects the substance inside. By some strange Mario-universe logic, it's possible that once the moons are collected, they refill energy on their own, which would explain why the Odyssey doesn't need more moons to go back to previous locations AND how the moon number never goes down after they're collected, whereas if the moons were a nonrenewable resource, then the number would go down as more energy were used.
Hey matpat, would the plungers work with the stuff theyre atatched to in fortnite? Like the grapple gun and suction grenade. And if they wouldint work, how could you make it work?
Bruh the Mario franchise is tired of being milked
What's next shaggy is actually mario?
hiT Or mISs
I might unsub because you got sponsored by tik tok
Heck
no
Oh my god Mario is sans and sans is ness this is mindblowing
make a theory of how old is scrooge mc duck in the ducktales reboot
It could be that in NDC the moons recharge their energy and they only use like 60 moons and while a moon goes without power, immediately starts to recharge it's energy ü§î
Good video matpat. Shame about the moons and their ever continuing exploration as an alternative energy source. Our world knows we need that more than ever.
TikTok...  so now officially the Blooper Reels app.  :-P
Ur still making videos and I love it

Go on bro üëä üëç
Sees Tik Tok In Video Wait What?
Sorry MatPat but I subscribed a long time ago.
yes, yes i CAN
mat stop ignoring me and do a monstrum gt live
Welp. Even though you are on furry haven, I have a theory. So I was reading a Pok√©mon handbook. It said ‚Äúpeople who see Ho-Oh (the Pok√©mon) will be blessed with everlasting happiness.‚Äù If you remember, ash saw Ho-Oh in the first episode of Pok√©mon. What if ash‚Äôs version of ‚Äúeverlasting happiness‚Äù is never aging?
We need more lore theories :]
Bruh how did you get 28.7k followers OVERNIGHT??!??
But what if The Odysee takes the "Juice" out of the Moons and uses it as an Material for the Baloon?
In my opinion tiktok is toxic. I will never do it.
Can you finish this episode without touching a coin?

Me: I‚Äôm counting out the money in my piggy bank. Why.
Lol, #5 trending for gaming
Ahem. POPPY GLORIA! POPPY! GLORIA! WE GOT AN OPSIE ALERT!!! OPSIE!!
1:45 clue to the game
Oh god he has tik tok now there will just be even more cringe here
Just make diet theories for the ideas that aren't full episodes
In a little over 15 minutes and 38 seconds :)
I guess Mario's ship is super power efficient. or the ship is a fusion reactor.
The day the world ends is when MatPat joins TikTok
But the city is lit up just after you beat the boss, which is before you have to do the mission of restoring the power plant
Now calculate the power of the Just Shapes and Beats triangles
i mean, who says they're exausted for good in the generator? for all we know it's the same dozen or so stars cycling round endlessly
I always thought they were self-recharing magical batteries/capacitors. Would explain why you need set amount of them, but never need to refuel..And that powerplant just has big stash of powermoons on rotation. The very moment they have fully recharged themselves, the plant drains them
i expected austin, but i get matpat
but it's fine tho
so...... WHERE DID YOU GET THIS KNOWLEDGE?
well if it was just run through a world murder every one and hop back on the odyssey (mario's ship) it would not be very fun.
you have atleast 2 bosses in each world. the Broodals, and the boss for that world. like in Bowser Kingdom, you fight the last 2 broodals then you fight some robot thing that all the broodal control. then you have to collect more moons cuz 3 is not good enough.




Then you have your mario 64 refrance at the end once the game is over with the mushroom kingdom you can go through paintings to fight bosses again.
But cappy still wants to explores and crap so you go get ALL the extra moons you never got for the bonus game + the moons from the moon rock.
Can you make a theory on who is Bowser Jr's mom
Can some one make a counter for how many times he said ‚Äúpower‚Äù
MAYOR PAULINE? You mean Mario‚Äôs ex girl, like u figured out before? Oh crap
I have a question for what you said at 9:25 with the calorie. Was that a food calorie (Kilocalorie) or a basic calorie of physical energy?
Who else caught the Tom Lehrer reference at 12:05
Poopie head like gaY theoryyyy
Why did MatPat sell out?
Please Matpat I love you videos
Oh no... he got tik tok... he‚Äôs been infected
7:03 oh yes it does
Matpat Gets Sponsored By TIKTOK! SELLOUT!!!
