Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
i hope creepy joe biden wins the democrat nomination as he 'll be handing president trump four more years
they 're going to have to flip a coin and have the super delegates decide who gets to run against trump
ca n't see this schmuck winning against trump
biden 's still better than trump
trump already win 2020
pres trump 2020 win will be historically epic
bbc wants anybody any lowlifer as long as it 's not trump
the only qualification needed is not being donald trump voting him out is the whole point
i think trump will win again
lets make america even greater with trump
do n't worry about it because donald trump will win agen
trump is gon na win again so dems are wasting their time and corporation bribe money
intelligent people vote donald trump
i 'd vote for joe any day over trump at least he 's not a liar and a gritter and will bring more stability and dignity to the office
the only dem candidate pulling over large amounts of trump people

trump is the best
love trump
i 'm so proud of president trump
i love trump
thanks mr trump my bike üö≤ always gets stolen i ‚Äô m going to build the wall around my garden to its 5ft at the moment think i do 7 to 8ft dam thieves
trump is more focused on the wall more the 137 us military killed in afghanistan 2 weeks ago
trump we have been working very close to south korea..south koreans you just messed up everything and said you deserved the nobel peace prize
europe needs a trump or many trump 's or all is lost
the honorable donald j trump the best and greatest president in history
best leader in the world trump
so we all gon na ignore the fact that not 2 long ago he referred to the wall as a future trump monument
that would be a far better system than what trump wants to do
great speech president trump üëåüëç
trump would have more success convincing people the earth is flat than getting the wall built
trump should be focusing more on climate change then a wall
trump a real leader maybe uk will get ride of flip flop may
love from the london u.k get it done mr trump
i do n't think there can be any doubt that this surely trump 's magnum opus will go down in history alongside churchill 's 'we shall fight on the beaches speech and mlk 's i have a dream
trump is right yet again
first of all im deeply thankful for trump 's stance on venezuela i feel his support will bring in real change
trump is the one of the reason china to become super power
we love trump
we love trump
great trump has guts uk brexit dealers take notes
it does n't sound or look like emergency trump with a cool blue tie talking about china uk trade good relationship with china success summit vietnam summit with chairman kim chung un best friend exciting to meet a little rocket man talking about agenda of the meeting very relax over 5 minutes talking about bla bla
i have just completed reading crippled america by donald trump what a awesome book we need this guy in the uk
individual companies such as the trump family organisation itself realised that they could exploit poverty stricken chinese workers instead of having to pay decent wages in the us
mr trump is appropriate and good president for american
trump just wants another concrete edifice built by others paid for by others and slapped with the trump family brand for eternity
trump is still millions of times better than hillary
i laugh whenever i visit the bbc news web-site and read the anti trump comments
the best president ever trump 2020 too
the big beautiful powerful trump wall
trump doing more for the benefit of the usa than any leader in the last 50 years and the sneering weasel liberals ca n't take it
trump just a complete lying conman
president of america donald j trump america loves you forever ‚Äú you the first and the last president ever in the history of america america except you 2020again l god blessed america 2016 he will bless america 2020
the president of america donald j trump america loves you especially the america force the army air force the navy national army president donald j trump america loves you for making america great again
we can bash trump in bbc comments but anything to do with traitor may the dictator comments are blocked brussels broadcasting corporation at its shitty best
glad he did this cause democrats were resisting anything trump did even if it is the correct course of action to make for the country better
long live trump
obama clintons are globalists soros disciples trump is for strong borders the u.s.a
trump is doing a great job
trump the greatest president in the modern times

Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
btw i 'm also here for how d trump reacted he did n't disappoint me.i love donald trump he 's on another level person.love you orangie
despite your thoughts on politics at the moment despite what you think bush did or trump does we could at least be respectful enough to let the man have a funeral
0:21 love how bush said presidents and first ladies and did n't acknowledge trump individually
now you can see that they are human just like everyone else.sorry i ca n't say the same about trump cause did you see him barely shaking his head saying no at 11:46
seeing obama and trump that close kind of freaks me out
