Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
if you are going to do so much why now you 've been in politics for 40 years 8 years in the adminitration and you have done nothong
how exciting
great i 'm so excited we 're finally going to be able to hear who joe biden really is and what he believes for the first time just kidding he 's been a politician for six decades or more i ca n't imagine how excited people are to hear what he has to say finally smh
trump is going to win
gg cbs lol
im thinking mob ruled teamster onion is a special interest grupe forcing the labors to donate to demos
trump works better done more
lol sterling reputation
creepy joe is your best candidate lmao
come on you can do better
he 's old why they pick him
need more coffee joe to beat trump
after over 40 years why not hang it up and give young candidates a chance and enjoy a fine retirement
😂😆 this guy trying to find good things biden did the for the unions is embarrassing
well if they cant use corrupt hillary then i guess this is next best choice lol 'prostitute myself biden his words btw not mine lmao
not looking good as q dem candidate.also he is not a communist like bernie sanders
his first day he met with a comcast executive and got a lot of money
no one wants joe
how was biden working with middle class americans when he and obama raised the cost of health insurance by 100 200 300 percent in most states
trump kind of lowered the bar when it comes to presidents i would guess anyone following him will be seen as a relief even creepy joe biden
bernie is the best candidate in the election
how funny
anyone that takes over the white house will automatically do a better job than the piece of garbage that 's running america right now anyone but the donald 🤣😂
very smart reporter to ask 2 people present in a biden gathering “ which 2020 candidate do you support ”
i 'm sure creepy joe would be a very hands on president
he supports the establishment and issues about ukraine crime bill iraq war america joe biden is the past move on and pick an honest politician
he was proud of this bribe and extortion to protect his son
guess that makes him the perfect democrat as they all seem to hate the usa and its taxpayers
😂😆 this guy trying to find good things biden did for the unions is just embarrassing
sock puppets are always fun little kids love them
this guy would stick his hand up your mothers skirt at the same time stick his tongue in your 11 year old sisters ear
what a bunch of liars president trump best president ever
🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏 keep america great 🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏 trump 2020
good
joe biden the great white 'fondler is more likely to be indicted than ellected into the oval orifice
for example the tanya and reena show is already much more explosive than the washington posts efforts to attach intern impeached outrage as the presidents priority
he could get caught with a dungeon full of ball gagged little girls and the media would still sniff his jock and carry his water
judging from the thumbs down to thumbs up ratio i do n't think he has that much of a chance
we really only need andrew yang and bernie sanders the only democrats with original new ideas
dont like socialist i mean demócrats any more
specially the new ones
the stakes are too high

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
very very very tremendous very incredible tremendous thousands upon thousands very very very some people say most people say really everyone has told me tremendous amount of wall
potus bone-spurs rambles about vietnam and his new up-coming summit speech in hanoi and many many other items called stuff
take a shot every time he says very
i have heard drunks at bars who are more understandable than this guy
this is an orwellian nightmare coming true
funny how he says china does n't have a drug problem when that 's where a large portion of fentanyl is made
if it 's such a national emergency why did it take nearly 5 minutes to tell us
who know what that means because it only meter if we get it done lol what
he sounds like a rambling old man well i suppose that 's what he is so no surprise there then
how can trump declare a national emergency and then go to mara lago on the same exact day for a weekend of golf and leisure
here 's the life cycle of all great nations
elect a clown expect a circus
it was not only better it was like 100 better
the words of the greatest orator of all time
the president wears a super huge diaper and he fills it daily
good
it 's obvious the dems do n't know what 's good for our country
nothing like so me good ole fake news
thank you for putting americans first president trump
quick
😂 straight to courts
mr president you are the best
this is good finally the security we needed down there so tired of foreign opportunists and anti national rhetoric
20:15 and they just cut him off with some bs news anchor who wants to tell you what he thinks
no one wants to hear what you agenda driven faux journalists have to say
so glad the wall is going to be built
sometimes it 's okay not to smile
i tried to ask him a beautiful well thought out question and he shut me down
he 's amazing
yeah right sure
you pulled the wool right over our eyes
so many times with all your lifes
yeah right sure
i never remember a president brave enough to speak without a script for such a length
why did you cut him off at the best part
it is n't relevant if 'the generals think congressional appropriations are a good idea
they 're laws when they become effective
the executive does n't get to appropriate
cool content just subbed
amazing job president trump
if so many drugs are being trafficked into the united states isnt that a u.s problem more so than a mexico problem
if americans are buying so many drugs building a wall isnt going to help because the drug addicted americans are still going to be in the country and they 're going to find a way to get their drugs regardless of a wall or not
the solution is much much deeper than just a wall trump does not seem to be able to comprehend that concept
good job mr
when they are stopped they are stopped at legal ports of entry
one very important key factor you guys keep leaving out human trafficking is through holes in the wall lot more kids have ended up on the missing list where are these children going
such an emergency he waited on it for the first 2 years of his presidency when republicans owned senate snd the congress
so much mony give some to the schools
real news
great leader
people who have nothing to hide and want to enter the correctly not illegally
your turn 9th shitcuit circus make sure to reference 10 usc 2808 and 33 usc 2293
russia keeps on winning
he should be in a straight jacket
trump grabbed that guy really fast
we all knew that this president will run the country the way he has run his businesses no wonder he has filed for bankruptcies many times without oversight he would have bankrupted this country in his 1st year not to mention his lawless acts now celebrated by billionaires who profits off of it god bless the hardworking people in d.c keeping him in check
great man great hair great suit really a true american someone that cares about the people god bless you president trump
wow
national emergency beautiful 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✅✅✅✅✅✅
trump for president wooooooo lmao
trump made the right decision
the media even did not put them on the first line of the news
i was listening to trump and the tv guy cut in and started commenting so i have to find an uninterrupted full speech
first step towards a dictatorship
a page straight from the putin play book
msnbc cnn cbsn watch 1:06.35 potus clearly states “ i didn ’ t need to do this ” is emergency by definition the complete opposite
point of debate right here
just wait till the inditements begin then the liberals will really be screaming lol
this is stand up comical
cbs is really trying to be 1 over cnn
hey i 'm proud of trump he 's doing alright
he 's a good president
so how much do you think the giant trump lighted neons sign on the wall will cost
the reality freak show filmed live at 1600 pennsylvania ave has putin and the oligarchs rolling in the aisles
wow
i love trump
great love and respect for trump
negotiation right
that poll was taken at a university lol indoctrinated little shills took the poll
ya that 's believable
ooh he looks soo nice now why is that
the american people voted him in to take action on those issues
that would be so interesting
love how they have to tiptoe now when media is so used to us buying everything they spin
i would think the pentagon would like to see some highly capable critical thinkers for tomorrows cyber and technical battlefield
trump best potus🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 maga 2020
get ready to fill the fema camps seeing un troops down you 're street
fox is the best for fair and balance reporting but you cnn cnbc abc cbs nbc and that b station do n't know the meaning of those words
this is a present for social democrats
republicans and conservatives will live to regret this day
be ready declarations for gun control and climate change
got ta love trump
making america great again
i ’ m waiting for this to be interrupted by the price is right 21 minutes into his speech
ok lets be realistic
that is far more than the population of san francisco crossing in just that year
the koch brothers own a lot of detention facilities
they do or get cheap labor
where i live it is becoming more like india that america
this is more of a colonization that immigration
now before i start let me do my real state of the union ok everybody.also the state of emergency i do n't really have to do right now i could do it in some years.but you all knew it was n't an emeergency already sooo yeah moving on
there is a major national emergency
243 lbs huh is the doctor dyslexic maybe 423 he cant even get his breathing under control he wants to keep border under control
he could 've taken 1.6 billion to make some slats collect data use that to prove the success of a wall to get more
believing in a democratic process could be not voting for trump but hoping he succeeds and believing in a democratic process also means believing congress controls the budget
there is crisis when thousands invaders attempt to stampede into our country and drugs smuggled in since we are the most profitable market in this part of the world
the wall is one main infrastructure needed together with many surveillance monitors both on ground and under
the main reason for the canal was economic as well as security of the country
the president wanted the us to be able to move navy ships quickly from the atlantic to the pacific ocean
we are planning on building walls in the real world while russia and china tear down cyber walls
trump modern day hitler
lol from 🇲🇽
i love how they act like only a few hundred thousand illegals a year is a good thing
trump thinks he is the damn king and can do whatever he wants
lmao trump is without a doubt the dumbest president in u.s history
its good also to hopefully put a damper on the human trafficking drug trafficking and illegal gun trade not to mention the possible terrorists that might come up through the southern border
americans good luck 🍀
what does great again actually look like
lol he just opened a can of worms it 's going to be a free for all and the end of the gop
good news on the eradication of the syrian caliphate
now if we could clean up the ninth circuit
cumo signed a state emergancy and passed the ny safe act out of neccesity for saftey when the shooting wasnt even in ny state
great job mr trump
since most white america is being killed by legal drugs is he going to give big pharma the death penalty or some in the c.i.a
i highly doubt it
lol
he promised the left did n't want to help or play nice cause they need the votes so he is making it happen
good job trump love it maga2020 you know the dems hate it because they love those illegals and put them before the american people
so these weman are getting taped tape over there mouths and your building a wall to stop them from getting help so you really dont care for weman and how they are being treated by men
but yes there was collusion by certain democrats with russia and others
emigration can be control with big penalty for hiring them trump is the biggest criminal in history of us..for many reasons dangerous sociopath
would like to see someone go into these newsrooms while theyre airing live and put a gun to the back of these news casters heads and ask if they really beleive in all the democratic bs they spout off their mouths with then pull the tigger and tally up the yes and nos
boy oh boy all those people that were put in prison for “ intent to sell ” for possessing one more gram than they ’ re allowed to have for consumption
re-election confirmed
what does a wall have to do to be 99 effective
then goes through legally to see if he can get money through the courts
if the great dictator spends any money that was originally allocated for national defense on this border wall vanity project then we need to vastly decrease defense outlays
now the legal fight can begin to block trump 's attempt to use a faked emergency to over-ride congress constitutionally-protected power to control spending by the federal government
watch for more trump tweet-storms as his latest move of faking an emergency to end-run congress gets blocked by congressional committees and federal judges
it is not just the democrats in congress who disapprove of this latest trump scam
there are many republican members of congress who do not approve of trump 's attempt to reduce congressional power and undermine the separation of powers outlined in the us constitution
us voters will remember this this latest con job from the trump administration when they go to their polling stations in 2020
we totally agree with the president donald j trump in using anything that has in the hand of a super powerful nation in protecting the people of america
may god bless the president and protect him in the love of god
he ’ s really doing good things for people and country
he ’ s really a great gift from god for usa in the world today
the majority of successful smugglers know that too that 's why the drugs make it in
so many disgraceful comments
the problem with cbsn is its fake news like 93 of media if you people can ’ t hear the truth and president trump clear message of putting america first by making it safe you are all blind idiots full of pride a lot of people didn ’ t like trump when he first came into office but if you can ’ t understand all that he has done and is doing to make america great than i suggest you leave this country because you obviously have no respect for america and it ’ s people
why is politics on main street did i speak to a foreign power
i 've never seen a president from any party with the lack of depth to their answers or that repeats himself as much as trump
basically he is honest in the sense he signed the bill and took as much money from congress as they can
that created the emergency that avoids another shut down in order to secure the border
this man has no empathy for anyone and he certainly has no honor
lol n trump is written in the stars til 2028/2030
talking about wise guys fake news again
lmao there are less expensive ways to have border security with drones and high tech surveillance if i know this then trump most definitely knows this
he wants a physical wall because a wall is a symbol of “ not welcomed ” throughout history we ’ ve seen what walls represent
like i said if it was really about protection and national security there much much cheaper and effective ways of protection but this isn ’ t about that period
i 'm pretty sure 40,000 people would go to the border to help build just like the pentagon once its final also millions have been raised by charitable patriots
did n't he write a judge a letter requesting a break for his friend the major drug trafficker joey wiechelbaum
i hope that many republicans watch this speech in full
i am certain that many of them will come to the conclusion that it is time for article 25 the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office
this is just a shameful anti america site full of antifa libertards and democraps
1.6 billion he first said yes
if the high courts accept this case and rule in his favor republican 's will rue the day
and congress will not be able to overcome it
it will come back and bite you right on your a
america first
good
the real national emergency is the president of united states so simple crazy fool🌵🌵🌵🌵👺😁
free el chapo
he hurt this nation more than he has hurt russia trying it
the boarder is older than trump
trump wants the death penalty for drug dealers
i am a liberal but i am happy the wall is being built
listen we waste far more money on things that do nothing for this country like the 100s of billions being spent on this war
the usa courts will be busy with trump 's so called national emergency funds to build that wall
let 's believe him and his stat should be ok for democrats i assume
not everyone is a good wallclimber right
cheeto is testing out how far he can go to become a full-on autocrat
he did just sent the dictator of egypt congratulations on winning an election where all the rivals were jailed or otherwise disqualified from opposing him
i love donald trump
he is fact checked over and over and he lies a specially about the southern border..a major liar
and in the end it is all grounds to impeach the cheeto lol
think and grow rich
the best president ever
it is so funny to me that the legislative body of this nation and governors and state attorney generals begin lawsuits once potus declared a state off emergency to get his border wall and keep in mind i am no supporter of president trump
so going into the next election year the house and senate who should be making these laws shreds the constitution in the same manner by having the batf with a pen and directive re-write the law after they already said bump stocks and other rate increasing devices for firearms were not only not an automatic weapon device under the national firearms act and allowed the sale of these devices but now if you do n't forfeit these formerly legal devices you become a felon and go to prison
holding it just right and allowing physics to do the rest will cause automatic like firing from the fore-mentioned rifle so what will they ban next our fingers
our forefathers are looking down in shame as this great experiment in democracy has become the worse case scenario of itself
the real national emergency is having human garbage for a president
25 45 and quick
chairman kim has economic potential
these social problems will not be solved by a wall
beef up border security fine
trump is the best potus ever
trump harasses the press so much
well done mr president those who don ’ t realize we have a national emergency just travel to one of our southern borders and see i want my hard earned tax money to benefit my family and my fellow countrymen and i don ’ t want to benefit somebody who wants to cross the border for easy living
we have to control and secure our borders for our future america before it goes beyond our control
a complete lunatic who should be thrown out right now before he throws the world in a complete disaster
yet another promise fullfilled and the left 's main talking point sinking faster than a brick in water
the us is a country that greatly over rated through out all these small towns and villages in mexico and central america
the political class are very talented at stirring up there baseball in the name of votes
his politic career pretty much like adolf hitler
both of them are orator good at acting
i doubt that most drug dealers would try to get through a port of entry
the logical choice would be through unguarded borders
anyone who wants the wall does n't care about regular people trying to find a better life in our country
thanks donald
trump and his 'very good relationships with korea and china we 're friends
i feel that he wants to be in the big boy bully clubs of power and fear in the world
this man stands there and tells bold faced lies
it 's incredible that the press even bothers to ask him any questions
also he 's saving the whole world too
quote what ’ s good for liar
it is not a fabrication it is a real crisis
it may encroach on congress ’ power but obama signed more executive orders that took congress ’ powers away than any president combined
the main commodity the mexican cartels are dealing in right now is human trafficking
get ollie north in there with his old partner elliott abrams they 'll find the money
what 's the point of the wall because as trump just admitted that when they come to the wall they ca n't get in unless they turn left or right and go through where there 's no wall
apparently you do n't need to be very smart to be president or to be old enough to vote
make america great again
two of trump 's problems are time and space.another is knowing and reporting actual factual information in a coherent manner
i love it
what trump is saying is completely 100 the truth
you wanted some idiotic murderous lady as your president i 'm sure she could win in mexico so go jump the fence and vote for her over there
lol
if dea sold some of the illegal drugs seized at the mexico border for legalized recreation purposes they would have plenty of money to build a really nice wall
20 years ago the idea of legal recreational marijuana was a joke not taken serious maybe in 20 years from now there will be a form of legal recreational cocaine
gray state today starts the day of martial law will see how fast things accelerate from here
most of the drugs is coming true the ports
i love president trump
lol mexico is paying for it
his daughter married a rich jew
but anti-semitism is at an all time high in this country
haha go trump finish the wall 👏👏
good luck in the future
he is the loud mouth at the end of the bar shouting that the way to stop crime is public executions confident that we can solve the problem with iran by dropping a few nukes on them
if russia defeats fascism again how many of you will be shot dead
the trump bots are in full force in these comments
he tried playing nice but no more mr nice guy
and i really do n't give a damn about the opposition at this point
have a nice day everyone
potus your the cartel that needs to be attended to you need to be booted out of the white house now we no you are as cucoo as everyone says you are ooh yea the croweds are huge so huge we cant even see you how funny from a cucoo man
they are going to be supporting these migrant caravans from now on not us
next the government will try to add more laws and control us more and more
america is ending and we will all be getting killed by our own government and they will blame another country
good job donald
or maybe you 're one of the uneducated trump loves so much
perfect now he gave real presidents more executive powers
trump 's the true national threat
if he runs again in 2020 i will register at my new location to vote for him again

Synagogue shooting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
god bless his soul that was no ordinary rifle
unconditional love is the highest form of love a godly love rabbi you are a beautiful soul my prayers for you your people for us all 🙏🕎🙏🇺🇸
it 's a beautiful story how you and your wife came here and fulfilled such a beautiful vision
ms lori is indeed a hero my heart goes out to the family and indeed this beautiful community.may god bless you all and love you and multiply you 🌹
all praises to the most high yah
there is a special place in for the cowardly shooter there was never a question who the shooter was the cops should have killed him on sight
she sounds so wonderful
god bless them at the synagogue with strength and love to rebuild their lives
the rabbi did a great job of really demonstrating the enormous pain that occurs when a tragedy like this happens because we are all becoming desensitized to this and that ’ s not ok
create joy build a community be open to loving humanity
find love for yourself and your true goals and dreams
kjv john 8 33 they answered him.we be abraham 's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free
we need to knw how criminals can get away so far and repeat same patterns
stay strong our brothers and sisters we feel your pain we love you here in ny
he was motivated by the killings in pittsburgh and christchurch new zealand
they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun for the lord god will give them light
oh lord i can ’ t believe it god bless u lorrie pray u with god n at peace love u
what a brave rabbi
there are none good no not one
rabbi thank you for that beautiful message
i love the jews
n it is peaceful n safe we love u again i ’ m so sorry for ur loss
i wish we all can get along so the world could be a better place to live
youtube has taken off all the videos of the people who have done the research on this shooting and so many others
stay strong rabbi
it is pretty amazing he 's missing fingers on both hands but no shots to anything vital
we need to be responsible and subsequently be
ready to protect the innocent
only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with gun
kjv john 8 33 they answered him.we be abraham 's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free
anti-white bigotry is the real threat
this all just does n't add up right
bigot shoots four people and gets to be portrayed in the media as a mentally ill misguided but fundamentally good person
18:01 reporter asks the rabbi we ca n't live in fear is that what you want people to know
rabbi 's answer absolutely
true
we are not to live in fear due to the actions of others that is mankind but we absolutely must remain fearful of god for our own actions as this is showing true love and awe of our creator
someone who has lost his finger is not in a fit state to talk like this the next day
the most high is coming
i am a non denominational christian but have had the honor to act as 'shabbos goy forgive my spelling sir on more than one occasion for our observant jewish neighbors
what 's becoming of religious freedom
america is a nation of many religions
his hurt tells me more about his politic
let me clear it up for you
this will not be the last for sure
let us now be instruments of gods divine love and peace
forever finger messed up i believe you said blown off his hand sure shaking that right fist around it 's only been a day i think the stitches should be throbbing he must be on some good medication personally i 'm not so sure i kind of think it 's a scam i was too good of a speech in the way you kept swinging his hand around is hurt in and grabbing his head like there 's nothing wrong with his hand
this man gives a much needed human touch to the horrors of domestic terrorism
her future if she is allowed by tmh to live will be slavery read it for yourself
this rabbi could have been killed had that woman did n't shield him from any more gunshots
this is real testimony from a survivor of a tragedy that has actually happened
conspiracy theories are complete lies and hatred against any religion whether it is judaism or islam must be annihilated from the every country on this planet
he 's amazing
he 's right darkness always give way to light
judaism has my heart and soul luv catholic childhood jewish people have my first hand you are the people that will lead the world
tmh will protect his own all others will perrish for messing with his chosen ones
surely not the ashkenazi that are in israel and all over today right
love and prayers for the jewish folks i ’ m a christian but jesus christ was the purest jew and rabbi
my great great uncle hugo was a holocaust victim in berlin so this hurts deeply close to home
i was just celebrating passover with my jcc special needs group just the other day blows my mind
but the demonic entries who want hate and fear have lost love and light concur all
when do we wake up it took new zealand a whole week to start getting something positive done
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt anyone anymore
he then said you know part of the reason it takes so long is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore
i promise you i will pay your legal fees
amazing rabbi a true spiritual leader and healer.💙
but please teach your children that there are many religions and we have to respect that
omg i hope everyone is ok
these people are the true psychopaths ask him about the noahide laws and what they think of goyim
this is very touching
i feel very conflicted
he wants all of the jews back in israel now
take the hint start packing and be quick about it
stand strong
very sad how much more of this nra enabeled craziness are we willing to tolerate
very fine people on both sides
you happy now trump😠
ahhh the great storytellers
they use these sites the exact same way that isis and alqaeda uses websites to recruit more followers and spread their messages of hatred and violence
another gun jam i ca n't emphasize enough the importance of good maintenance
this rabbi offers little light despite his plethora of heroic words and heart felt emotion
reference to his stated beliefs is reserved for page fifteen in the local newspaper as well as the new york times
where is the forgiveness part.i doubt very much if this 19 year old punk even understands this anti-semitism
quick
i blame donald j trump and steve bannon for the atmosphere that fosters this kind of madness
god preserve us to be able to see the end of this hateful administration
remember the terrorist is a christian lol
as you told the true israelite when they were where you are right now
get over it it happens to many why not you
no symphony for thise who have oppressed the true chosen ones and knew it and will not admit who we are until you tell the world who the true israelites are you will continue to lose
the lying rabbi many shall come in my name rabbi and shall deceive many quite from jesus christ
more and more countries are now recognizing palestine as an independent country alhamdulila
trump said there were good people on both sides of the shooting
in fact he did the exact opposite his first year in office
you 're not the true jews of the bible you 're not the true seed of abraham
i came to the conclusion that this incident is/was not a false flag because this demonic mistake in nature trash rabbi lost a finger
if these are true jews from israel i pray that the lord will bless them and get them back over there to their rightful land
donald trump enables far right terrorism
the media is trying to sweep this story under the rug because this was not a false flag
john t earnest is a very real character
he took matters into his own hands and rightfully so
the media does n't want to give young white men with nothing to lose any ideas on what to do and how easy it would be to execute a plan like this
this is why there is n't too much attention in regards to this situation given by the media
but truthfully someone in a group of 200 ppl threw a rock at a protest and their 13 year old brother got shot in the chest and face
you can blame that on californian liberals for this this would n't have happened if i was there if i had the right to bear arms in cali i could have protected them god bless texas
this happened right after their convention
they wanted to know how many died and were injured instead of who lived
how many stories we did n't hear
we send useless thoughts and prayers instead of any kind of action
does the rabbi 's recounting sound terror fying enough
first of all he 's a white male so hes not a terrorist
and 3rd give that man an oscar for that great performance

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
quasimodo really be out here saving us from frollo
how did they not have any fire alarms or smoke detectors lol
why did n't the ones in there phone the fire brigade no one noticed it was on fire until it was to late an iconic building wow
lol
glad no one was injured
france officials calling for a crescent moon on top of notre dame
its a pretty clear sign
i mourn for the cathedral it is sooo sad she was one of the greatest artistic architecture of human history
but i am very thankful that i happened to see her
your promotion of the show the good fight is going to come back to bite you
oh it 's cbs you can be sure whatever they say serves their political and corporate agenda
glad for the favor in this situation that no one was hurt either
at the end should new technology be used in the renovation of this priceless relic
aluminum can be antiqued and will look great and you can eliiminate all those absurd flying butresses
this is the 21st century so lets go we 're the cultural that built the wtc and then watched it crumble to the ground in controlled demolition style
more aluminum for notre dame
the belltowers and the main structure are intact
notre dame can easily be restored and rebuilt
lots of old historic buildings have been rebuild all over europe after the destruction caused in wwii
now the disturbing part is if they france/the city of paris/the catholic diocese decide to partially rebuild it in modern aka cheap style
it would be even more preferable to leave it in ruin than have some eccentric startchitect add some contemporary flare to it and turn notre dame into a modern monstrosity
very symbolic indeed
yeah right
what a good view
oh no poor notre dame cathedral
i hope they can rebuild it exactly like it was
we express great sorrow
whats going one to us now to that antic beautiful historic monument
garou celine belle what 's matter now so much to remember🙆🔥notre dame de paris now
burn devils burns haha cant wait
so sad a great loss for whole humanity
the saints show us the selfless love of his way the saints are true interpreters of sacred scripture and he always said about energies the cause of this fire was an electrical overload in the wall and they were the source of the fire a song to comfort the spirits of the saint bartholomew of those who died at the shores of the seine and of swords comes martyrdom of the servants of god now where the huguenot camp 's is under siege and in rochelle happens an error men and women are fighting for their lives are thrown to suffer and die on the banks of the river seine then comes that one that with revenge in flames knocks down the notre dame tower
really frollo
i 'm not even french but i 'm depressed at the fact that so much of the history that brought us to where we are now is fading away
there needs to be strict laws placed in order to maintain our significant landmarks or the next thing you know places such as the roman colosseum or the taj mahal is going to collapse
lol
lol
never been to it but would love to go
i am all in on humainity easy bet here
my cousin went to paris two days ago i hope hes ok
aaaaannndddd cue to miraculous ladybug ending theme but in a more sorrowful tune 😭
i have no idea what it is but im sure it was important to many people and my prayers go to everyone
it like saying the sisteen chapel is just a ceiling the mona lisa is just paint everest is just a hill st peters basilica is just a meeting hall the grand canyon is just a ditch a 2000yr old 300+ft tall coastal redwood is just a tree whether natural or man made all of those l mentioned are so much more and are treasures to humanity and the beauty in them and the memory of them will last as long as the human race or longer
really points out how things come and go
the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands you need to have your heart circumcised because this may be the warning and the preview of last days
this comment section shows how fast people jump into conclusions
notre dame cathedral feeling cute might burn down later idk
i feel blessed to have been able to see this beautiful structure in person a year and a half ago
say it right
the end of an era and the start of a new
i 'd say you got your money 's worth
it 's hard to believe so iconic and so old is gone
i hope i 'm not the only one who cried watching the burning on live
a building burnt thankfully with nobody inside at the time although historic stunning and a national treasure still a building
hopefully everything doesn ’ t get damaged so i can visit in real life
outside building sprinklers are always good
most iconic church not worth a fire sprinkler system
this video is very interesting
what a waste of perfectly good scaffold
thank god i have beautiful pictures of both inside and outside
would it be too much to expect american newsreaders to actually learn to pronounce the name of the cathedral correctly
not any more
to all dear friend they still can build 100 more notre dame.but can not bring back life
anyone seen the plans for the new mosque yet
for the most part it will be victim to wrecking balls and bulldozers
burn burn burn and burn very cool by mevlüt çavuşoğlu
just a old building
probably caused by some frenchman smoking at the top of the building
💔 goes out to people in france 🇫🇷 in general
an identical/better architectural new construction 🏗 still
funny how no-one talks about the cause
1:48 lol you can hear a lime scooter alarm in the background
with enough money they can fix it good
if the main vaulted arches inside are still standing they should provide some protection for the rest of the inside
very toxic
the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands
the first person to reply has the big gay
very not epic
where is the hunchback going to live now
first is the terrorist attack in paris now the burning of the notre dame cathedral
nice
nice
i hope quasimodo is okay
lol no way
what man has to do now is develop elegant but very strong architecture
the great pyramid of giza in egypt has withstood the longest test of time and is the only one of seven wonders of the ancient world still standing
the third little pig who built his house of bricks had the right idea
im sure
okay what happened i just came back from school and go to youtube and see this
how does a building like this burn in the middle of a huge city
so the crown of thorns they say was christ thorns i 'm sure they was not gold oh well
why is it that the people doing the interview or news are not in sound proof rooms away from noises background people
good job renovators
lmao
you really do have to respect the history and the symbol that the cathedral was
with a light in the middle where the pointy thing used to be like the world trade center
because this is a new millennium and there 's no way they could redo several centuries of history
but i can not avoid seeing that there are entrepreneurs who are going to donate many millions of euros for their reconstruction
as my case i work since i was 9 years old
to have my own business
if someone wants to give me help to grow
i 'm not as important as a cathedral
many keep talking about priceless in regards to this fire
what i really want to know is the fire out
sneak peek of the fall of babylon the great
i think it 's good time to install water sprinklers as part of new innovation
also good property insurance
shouldent the building collapse completely after 9 hours on fire
after all buildings in new york collapses after 1 hour of fire
it is a beautiful cathedral
my first thought was that the government did it to try and squash the yellow vesters
i know it ’ s an old building understatement but you ’ d think there would be fire protection including fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems
i hope you can feel the feelings of the owners watching the cultural assets that you looted
i really don ’ t know how to respond to this
i am not catholic and can ’ t understand what is exactly what is going on
i really hope the hunchback is safe
glad i saw it when i had the chance
what caused the fire is what 's bugging me the most
a great victory
lexicon strong 's g40 hagios
strong ’ s definitions
they burnt down the whole talmud about 300 year 's ago
what caused the fire exactly
it has a history that is important to the world it can be rebuilt as it always has
this is exactly what happened in the movie
one day soon god will burn the whole world
we will have a new heaven a new earth
my question is why do major public history places always seem to go up in flames everytime there 's a restoration goin on am i the only that notice this and see how it 's always religious stuff related to jesus christ
it would be generous and appropriate for the vatican to kick in heavily for the rebuild
fireproof corrosion proof good for the thousand years
the old system of relgion are dispearing before are eyes
behold when ye are entered into the city the new consciousness there shall a man meet you ‘ bearing a pitcher of water ’ follow him into the house where he entereth in ”
it ’ s a shame that building was beautiful
so sad this happened i ’ m so glad i was able to go there see it was able to climb the top
i ’ m sure they can rebuild it but i hope this won ’ t be the next sagrada familia that would take decades
anyway this is a reminder especially to all christians that god the people is the real church
buildings are just gathering places just temporary our focus should remain on the worshiping praise of god who is not seen but is truly alive and not the relics the structure the material things that we see
oh jesus christ said you really must have that
wow
wow
isis already destroyed so many ancient western structures
surely this wasn ’ t deliberate too
lol should we not burn down all churches are they just places for pedophiles
what other religious group would gain greatly from this maybe not financially but maybe religiously
this does not mean anything viva virgen de guadalupe viva catholicism into his saints viva mexico
this was no accident there have been videos already saying the radical muslums did this and celebrated later on
all the material and historical items of the catholic church will not be in heaven when the new heaven new earth come to pass after christ 's second coming
we will not be able to take hold or do anything with material things as they will be destroyed in the end
as far as the fire itself news reports that the fire burned from the inside out
god tells us that we should have no other gods before him
if we 're gon na stay alive
watch the black smoke fly to heaven
see the red flame light the sky
take all you need to live inside
great news
maybe the fire is part of an elaborate insurance scam
msm has been hiding the truth about 10 churches in the city being vandalised in one week more so in the public domain now
idk why this guy 's voice annoys me not an appealing voice to be describing such tragedy and the stuttering doesnt help
april 15th is the most cursed day of the year
it was history to us which was 1000 year old
ok it ’ s good to burn
lol
lol
kinda ironic that this happened almost a week before easter
i believe that they were there getting ready for service
i ’ d be looking at the motives of “ mohamed 's roof restoration ” who were lead contractors on the re-roofing job or perhaps the muslim boy scouts climbing club visit that just happened to be there right before closing when the fire started
then i read the title of the story trump knows better than parisian firefighters
i bet that 's not the real crown of thorns
lol
just more nonsense
white guy must 've snuck in and read the real history
christians in the christian countries should become strong christians
apparently in jerusalem about the same time a mosque also caught on fire too so theres that
who wants to bet they tear it down and build a mosque
world is burning my friends and ocean is full of plastic
cathedrals could be rebuilt but 9 year old child lost leg by bombs ca n't
wow where they were crowned
no one cares what happened to greenfall and many people died wtf
guys xxxtentacion is alive
exactly what democrat/socialist/globalist want
notice how it burned exactly a week before catholic easter
i hope the new mosque looks just as good
im glad to see that eye sore gone it was a decayed tooth and im thrilled it was pulled today
and no matter how its rebuild it will always be second best
call it an accident but there is no way that fire got white hot in that short of a time
i saw the entire live feed and something major happened
y'all got tears for idolatry but no tears for the true yasharal
gosh such a beautiful piece of history lost
this was not an accident muslims have been starting fires 🔥 and media has been covering it up people need to know that ww3 has already started and mass migration is the first faze time to wake up
france 's greatest accomplishment a stone building that burns down xd
not even we are n't sure how
even if they fix it the original beauty that has been for hundreds of years is gone forever
a one bedroom apartment high up is preferred
a sign god is furious at those priests for molesting all those innocent children and the catholic churchs coverups of the scandal
millions of people question cbs news and what you all cover why are not all covering real facts and truth why is you leadership following fakeness and falseness
your company is in big doo doo because when the truth comes out wow wait till people keep following the hundreds of millions following joe rogan logan alex jones and the rest of real humanity you guys are nuts to cont
enjoy the muslims
an image of the spiritual reality of post christianity interesting that the mosque covering the temple mount in jerusalem was burning at the same time time for those who are awake pray very much
good
look at the smoke who 's the new pope
the age of aquarian requires major changes
the old buildings built on corruption must fall
i respect your belief but i ca n't find anything to be happy in this
thanks for the likes people
i 'm glad it burned
then trump tweets just dump water tankers on it wow we have a spart president
i better not here that a islamic temple is gon na replace this old church that would be going to far to soon
fire i 'm about to end your whole career
200 year for a cathedral but the pyramids took 20 years lol
it shows lack of leadership in the country to protect what is important
someone smoked a joint and didn ’ t put it out right
but really it sounds like a jihadi wet dream to burn it to the ground they love to destroy any and all historically important objects and locations relevant to western culture
the world has become mostly secular so it doesn ’ t matter
seems like a pay back for new zealand mosque terrorism attack
good job to anyone who did this
classical architecture of rome and greece might be more durable against fire
giorgio vasari used the term barbarous german style in his 1550 lives of the artists to describe what is now considered the gothic style 3 and in the introduction to the lives he attributed various architectural features to the goths whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered rome and erecting new ones in this style
lol do n't worry guys it 's a part of god 's plan
close enough but not too far
dreams walking in broad daylight
i love it
good riddance
looks like a new pope was elected
there has been many attacks on churches and even on nortre dame before so terrorism should not be crossed out
priceless meaning religion is a bogus made up construct by man to control man
this is the wonderful history of france
what a brilliant fire
hahahah that 's totally undoubtely a captivating view when i saw the fire
how fascinating it is is n't it
as an atheist i think of the pure historic importance of this building and the fact that in modern times we could not save a building survived 750 years a building that was still in use by modern people in a modern city with modern technology it seems somewhat biblical
islam owns the ground and have plans for a new mosque the end of france the end of christianty
wow
science really did beat christianity
this is what happens when they tell you illiegals are peaceful
a reputable investigator would say that “ all possible causes are going to be investigated ”
the most egregious examples of misinformation originated in the darker corners of the internet but many found bigger audiences on social media
one prominent conspiracy theory revolved around the claim that the fire had been deliberately started
and we know for certain that terrorists want to harm europe and christians in any way possible particularly at the beginning of easter holy week
like any honest investigation we should consider all possible causes
during the renovation many more people had access to the roof area than at any other time
the fire itself could have been a muslim conspiracy involving many people
this media action could be the biggest conspiracy of all to distract us from a terror strike on the heart of french christianity
yes it s a shame but parts of france have been burning for 22 weeks not as much said about that just brushed under the carpet as much as they can
it ’ s pretty lit rn 😎
burn baby burn the symbol of atrocities by the catholic church against so many ashes to ashes
this is very not epic
it 's so much fun on easter
omar is loving this
if anyone saw a middle eastern man near that fire it was probably jesus
we sure did n't make this fuss when bombs destroyed aleppo
hope everyone okay there
why arent the french so responsible they let a home of christ burn down
helps to put it on 1.25 speed to decongest that first guest
im very worried
great news
fabulous to see the fall of religion
bro it ’ s the hunchback of notre dame in real life
such beautiful art and history
but if you had the insight that i do and the analytical ability to calculate future paris population demographics then you would know that under macron 's leadership the out-breeding cult lead army of islam will convert the cathedral into a mosque in just a few more generations
wait notre dame is real
so glad that the most high is proving that catholicism is not his religion james 1:26/27 get ready for the ride down jepheth gen 10:5 and more expressly everyone who made that united nations agreement psalms 83:4
this week on watchya doin rabbi we are visiting a 12th century cathedral to light a fire in the heart of old france as new french look on and cheer
i for one am happy this has happened lol 😂 and that is my freedom of speech
the disney version of the hunchback of notre dame was way better
macron must be loving it
there is nothing unpopular politicos like more in a time or their own unpopularity better than something to unite people
harsh but so true
never let muslims near your places of worship
babylon the great has fallin
do n't believe their bs about not being able to fight the fire earlier
hahaha
maybe it 's an omen to the fall of the white race and europe as a whole
and supposed to be the first birth of moments of beauty
would be tears of joy
pure political set up demolish it to erect new building to gain more cant you see people it is pure intentional
it ’ s a building nothing more
it would cost too much for us to pay for the fire sprinklers but now we can get taxpayer money to install them for free to us of course
you see folks its much easier to socialize the loss/bennefit for those in power
to me this is symbolic of the energetic changes that have been taking place worldwide climate change environmental religious economic and hopefully and end to domination and control
best wishes
hey burn it in fiction not in real life
how convenient it burns down with no answers to questions the church has hurt young children
any word on if this was a jihadist hit on a major symbol of christianity
yet what a glorious building on par with the light house of alexandria and the colossus of rodes
the most casual condo-development renovation has better fire controls in place than this did
the official story smells to high heaven
this certainly wasnt an act of terror
were they able to save the masonic flooring in the chapel along with all the gargoyles on those towers
looking at how france 's political conditions are i bet a mosque will be built in its place because that 's what 's 'right these days
how many thousands and thousands of people were killed on the crusades by the same hands that build this cathedral and on the same period
the most ironic thing is that they burned the people alive including innocent woman and children
maybe a legacy of evil shouldn ’ t remain upon us no matter how beautiful and creative looks so we can move forward with the legacy of the hands of justice and unconditional love
let 's just be thankful no more altar boys will be raped or sexually abused any more
kind of fitting actually
i 'm more apt to believe a hater of western culture had possession of a lighter and a can of gasoline
just my opinion but alot of dark things have been happening since france allowed those syrian refugees in just like lebanon and netherlands and many others
i guarantee the media already knows who ’ s responsible for this lost
i really dislike how americans cover news stories
that place was full of demons and idols i 'm glad the was destroyed
check out how many churches have been attacked in france this year alone
lol muslims cheering and laughing about a satanic temple being burnt is that irony or what
priceless historic cathedral
how many people go and see this church to worship christ other than to just roam inside it and admire its architectural structure
french people been saying that this is their 9/11 wich is an absolute bullcrap
so all the dead people in nyc is a much worth as a symbolic religion cathedrale church
they say the heart of paris been hit wasnt the eiffel tower the heart or better the arc the triomp
i been in paris and yes it was a nice building to see but dont say it as 9/11 or to donate millions for a building wich the french can pay themselves
🤔 anyways welcome to the world of ados in am🇺🇸 kkka over 3 churches were burned in louisiana 😒

Hurricane michael
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
please use your brain if weather is really controlled would n't you think places like korea or us enemies would be wiped off the face of this earth one thing i will agree with is that big pharma conspiracy
there has to be something much darker and more serious going on behind the scenes in regards to the “ dem professional ” staffer jackson cosko
the best is yet to come for you in jesus christ name
the best is yet to come for you in jesus christ name
lol hurricane florence hooked around me what will be different about this 1
florida can give thanks to risk scott mister denier of global warming
i wo n't be surprised if florida again elect another global warming denier
well it wo n't do much good to remind people not to go out into flooded areas and downed power lines to avoid electrocution they have n't power to access social media
nature makes light work of human 's endurance to conquer it
there could have been more deaths easily god 's hand of protection is still on this country
i-75 and i-475 has trees across the road as far north as jackson ga both north and southbound lanes starting at cordele ga
basically was the entire live feed
i hope everyone was safe and rest in piece of anyone died send prayers to the injured
but make sure that north indians won ’ t say because you americans eat beef that ’ s why you guys had this
maria noah 's bagels also suspect in sexual harassment with the majority of the store
it looks better than mosul iraq after the us troops left it
i live in north carolina and a tree just fell on my garage i ’ m scared
wow
cool
but usa deserve more destruction coming from our injured mother nature

Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
i didnt vote or care much for either bush president but that was beautiful
pitch perfect eulogy from a son to a father
man he loved his father very much
what a great family
g w your father did leave this place better than the way he found it all that power and he used it to help everyone else on earth using none for himself
your father is so proud of you
beautiful eulogy
one can disagree with someone on so many things but if you can laugh together with heart then i always find comfort knowing we ca n't be all that different
great work from a guy who has trouble opening doors
a touching eulogy by a son for his father
beautiful eulogy almost got a little teary eyed
he and barbara had 6 kids 5 loved to adulthood and 19 grandkids
wonderful eulogy from a loving son to a great and cherished father
43 is a pretty good man himself
our sincere heart-felt prayers for the bush family
i may not agree with the politics of the bushes but as far as dignity and honor they were miles ahead of what 's in the whitehouse now
simply beautiful
george w spoke of his father mostly as a man who loved family friends and was a patriot for his country
very heartwarming and moving
george hw bush the 41st president of the united states is one of the youngest naval pilots to ever fly in combat
he spoke reassuring words to our nation about the homeless and did his best to unite this country
in defeat he befriended the man who replaced him and kept the good of our country in his thoughts each day
wow
even though you have never been known as the best “ speaker ” that was beautifully done george w say what you want about him and go ahead and disagree with his politics but there has never been a more down to earth president than george w he is someone that even the average joe american seemed to relate to
my family is originally from the odessa/midland area and my great aunt often talked about this she would often say if you did not know them you would have no idea they came from money
she said they never acted as though they were better than others in their small community
she did however say that w was a “ little ornery ” in her words which sounds about right
rip to president bush a great american and part of what is still the greatest generation
really moving
a great way to honor the father he loved
beautiful
r.i.p 41 🙏🏼 much respect
wow most moving a great family
this is a man who truly loved his father
beautiful good look little george
you can see how much he loves his dad
that entire family love h.w and barbara so hard
and g.w did a great job with this eulogy
bill 's reaction
president bush 43 u honored your father very well
this was beautiful
i could not could have said it better
you may always agree with president bush decisions but he was a great man
very nice tribute
he placed great value on agreat joke so i chose simpson to speak
wonderful eulogy
that was a great eulogy and it had to be very difficult for the family to go through multiple days of a funeral
beautiful
great speaker speech maker god bless👍
beautiful ❤
thank you lord jesus for another beautiful example of you can do with one man or one woman
what a beautiful legacy of love honor and respect
at the end he will be remembered for the loving husband and father before being president
god bless the bush family they are great people honorable
cool stories i love hearing them
you were great on 911 to
that was so beautiful ❤️
beautifully written beautifully delivered such a moving eulogy from son to father
the grand old party may have lost one of it 's best and brightest
safe journey rip
very touching eyoulogy..from
your eulogy to your father was perfect and he would be proud
beautiful and touching
a wonderful tribute/eulogy to his father and us president
a beautiful eulogy for his dad
you made him proud w
very well said and great tribute to george h bush.he was a good president and lead america during tough time including fall of communism break up of the soviet union
nicely written speech i almost forgot about all the war crimes
beautiful speech perhaps the best he ever gave after the one he made on 9/11
a wonderful tribute
you are a true daddy 's boy
i was five years old and i remember exactly where i was say you
great speech
best speech bush jr ever gave
beautiful speech
that was the best
thanks for bosnia mr bush
im not crying u are
outstanding dad and son
commercials even on a video this strong
how good was that
really great to see and hear this
a life in service for good is a beautiful thing
a beautiful eulogy
a good speech
you completely trashed both bushes every chance you got during their presidencies
never was a huge w fan and always thought he was a lousy speaker compared to most potus but he got this right and flawless
great job mr president
wow
i had my disagreements with both bush presidents but that was a very moving memorial
that 's straight from the heart i respect the man and wish we had more like him
i remember george bush sr like more than i thought
had a lotta laughs back then as i was only 20 when he became pres i was n't aware of the great man bush sn really was
thanks for caring
what a great moment in history
come on cbs news real classy stopping a beautiful eulogy from a son of his father to show an ad of some mafia cell phone game
this is what i always loved most about president bush
he was always an amazing speaker
the most humbling thing seen from a funeral like this is seeing republicans and democrats sitting under the same roof being civil and treating each other the way everyone should be treated
its a big idea a new world order
incredible
very special
love this family
i do n't care what color creed a person may represent at the end of the day we all are one race the human race my heart goes out to this family because it hurts to lose a love one especially a parent
probably george w bush 's best speech ever
very heart felt on the memories of his father whom he looked up to
great tribute from a son to dear father
great speech
nicely done
beautiful and eloquent eulogy my thoughts and well wishes sent to the bush family
george hw was a good president and i know his namesake son tries hard to be a good man too
i really like seeing fromer presidents together plus mr 45
i really love politics its my favorite thing i know its crazy but i really like it
president bush 41 was a good man a good president
it was nice to see president trump send a plane to texas so the bush family go to washington god bless you trump
for all the hate this man received 10 years ago i 'm glad that people realize he is good person
he made mistakes all presidents do but he is caring guy who did his best for his country
all the first women look great especially michelle
0:17 wow look at the carters on the far right they have been married for 72 years
beautiful
beautiful speech brought me to laughters tears
great job president bush
wonderful eulogy and thanks for all you have done
though i was young when bush sr was president i experienced a good job by the second
nothing shows more of a true good man except when one can cry over the loss of his father
i ’ m sure the left has much nastiness to say but that ’ s ok they can stay bitter and hateful
the rest of us can live a full and happy life until god calls us home
wow
mr president bush 43 know that you have touched many lives with the wonderful eulogy for your father
i would surmise that most people do not understand the sacrifice that a presidential family gives
some might find it glamorous and powerful
i see it as incredibly demanding and an unselfish sacrifice for your brothers and sisters around the world to say the least especially for those that know what they are in for
father and son to be presidents however well you know that is wonderfully unpresidented or..unprecedented
beautiful ♥️🇺🇸
the new world order can die
he too mentions his ww2 service his commitment to his family and his country his dismantling of the profit driven american war machine and his championing of a truly equal society where everyone regardless of status or race gets a real chance at success
what a smart man to be president after the air force
beautiful eulogy
he 's pretty hilarious although his father was a way better president
after jonathan kwitny unearthed duplicate copies elsewhere bush admitted through a spokesman a brief business relationship with jorge diaz serrano which he claimed lasted just 7 months yet which the duplicate sec filings made clear in fact lasted 4 years
what a stark contrast the elder bush was to trump exact opposites
great great great
apparently nothing is sacred anymore
great eulogy
a very well thought out and poignant eulogy with some messages for trump
i am no fan of george bush but he loved hid dad and i can appreciate and admire him for that
i liked his father much more and believe he did as far better job in leading the country
i did not care too much for his politicking but he was a good man and my heart weeps for the bush family for their loss
if yours is still alive please tell them everyday that you love them and how much they mean to you
i extend my utmost and sincere condolences to the entire bush family and i pray that their faith in god will help to guide them through this time of great loss and sadness
haha
who can tell me how many millions of deaths home and abroad were caused by the men and one woman sitting on the first two rows
very very nice speech but why did u invade iraq
you seem to be a nice father to somebody but you should have not invaded iraq
anyone using this as yet another excuse to bash trump should honestly consider swallowing a bottle of pills already
he is getting old
awwww white supremacy
he did n't mention his father 's famous quote if the american people knew what we had done to this country they would chase us down in the street and lynch us
good riddance
bills mouth was open the whole damn time
as i said before and i say it again i would 've been satisfied with a third bush with what is going on in washington now
too many americans have died
great service except for the smug looking embarrassment called trump.rip 41.you will be missed
i was never a fan of w but this was great
