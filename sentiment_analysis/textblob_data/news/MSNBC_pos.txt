Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
breaking news nobody cares or wants joe biden gasp
never forget that even with the benefit of hindsight biden gave george w bush a liberty medal just last year 2018 for bringing so much freedom to the world
really
how very anti climatic even for a creep like joey
i really do n't like bob dole lettuce
but the fruit is awesome
bush 's baked beans i 've always enjoyed
biden your memes were funny but bernie 2020
i guess a candidate that would actually do something about the ramped corruption that had been on display for the last two years would be asking too much
exceptional reporting andrea.👍☺👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
d
biden is only running to make sure bernie loses
why not just announce it now why does there have to be news about it for two days first
i win again 🤡
same old politics the only thing new is the suit😂
great guy though
2020 lol too funny
lmao hes still going to try
ok establishment
i hope yall are ready
read any good q posts lately
highly suggested reading
not voting establishment in the primary
uncle president does n't have a good ring to it
it sounds like biden is not too enthusiastic about this
if biden is n't a very strong yes on impeachment he might as well not bother to run
if you do n't run you wo n't know whether you could win or not
we have to stop this hyper partisanship and just vote for the best candidate of our choice
lol..creepy uncle joe has as much chance as cpl had
hahaha
his ideas are way too old school
joe biden ’ s senate career information that spans more than three
records might not be available until late 2019 possibly even later
we have another easy chance for 2020
no matter how much money he raises from big donors and wall street it will never make him likable or relatable to every day voters
nobody wants to hear him defend billionaires nobody wants to hear him defend republicans
the only people who like him are party elites media elites and older moderate democrats who think that it 's still the 1990s
big deal my pet dog announced it was running for president and spot is polling better than biden
he 's really going to get in touch with voters
he missed his chance in 2016 will be too old
love joe
i want new ideas not old guard
so we have had the hot diarrhea of presedent for two years i guess that 's why they think they can win us over with the plain oatmeal of candidates
the last time around joe biden said he was n't going to run because he had to put his family first meaning not america first
that 's fine
another thing he 's 76 year old too old to run for even the dog catcher in my town let alone for the potus
let bernie duke it out with trump and may the best man for the country win
i literally don ’ t know 1 person who wants biden to win
joe biden/al franken hands across america make groping great again 2020
keep in mind whites did same if not worse they got off we are still locked up
trumps making america great
lol this is not news it 's like speculation about speculation
he won ’ t be able to counter bernie with his middle way neoliberalism without attacking him with right-wing talking points
supporting bernie
no country for old men
half truths joe if you are going to quote trump give the full quote
that 's awesome
the first time biden ran for president was in 1980
i do n't care if he is best buds with obama bernie is getting my vote even if i have to write him in
more like corporate cork sucker
you are robbing bernie chances of becoming one
in the primary i ’ m voting for bernie
and if biden wins i ’ ll be voting green party
this is great news for republicans
🙄 i better stop rolling my eyes over this or they 'll get stuck
to old
is joe biden vs kamara harris wild card ms warren
mayor pete has my support we need new blood
biden has made too many mistakes that were detrimental to the black community
very smart for a democrat
biden has just too much baggage
here 's my thoughts on the dnc plan this time around with massive voter fraud like they did to bernie the dnc makes sure biden is the candidate
with even more massive voter fraud than last time they finally steal the election
older democrats seem to favor biden and younger bernie
lol
bernie sanders is too old
this country requires a new direction
let 's end the 'joe biden for president delusion right now
kamala harris is much better
my first question for mr
lol
biden is first in the polls by 27
wow what a great thought i just had i 'm going to announce i 'm going to run for president then i can raise money to pay my credit cards
who wants to vote for a child gropper and molester
wow
i am soooooooo excited
obama said you are a good man
also its fun to see all the bernie boys out now last time they were crying about it being hillary 's turn
time to storm washington by the millions and show em what a real government shutdown looks like
the reason is that to win he has to take the bully pulpit from trump
we finished the civil rights movement in the first stage
you can go and you can make all the money in the world but you ca n't build a wall high enough to keep the pollution out
you ca n't live where—you ca n't not be diminished when your sister ca n't marry the man or woman or the woman she loves
you can't—when you have a good friend being profiled you ca n't escape this stuff
hes not going to win anything
while biden has name recognition and if it came down to it i 'd cast my popular vote for him but i hear that he 's not for marijuana legalization across the board and that if true is one of the things i 'd hold against him
for me he must change his mind on that matter otherwise i might not even vote at all in the so called 2020 presidential election knowing that the president of the 🇺🇸 in not elected by the popular vote am still ambivalent on all the other dem candidates the gender and race of the candidate is of no factor to me even though i know that it 's a white-male dominated system of things
great leaders are never afraid to stand and fight for justice and truth even when confronted by rich and powerful men of the world
andrew yang needs to be the next president he would do the most to change america for the best its not about money it ’ s about people ’ s lives and there health i feel like some people out there would rather make money then save someone ’ s life
biden is great
give room to new talent joe
joe touch biden if i am your president i will keep your kids safe hug every individual i encounter i will make sure everyone smells good i will keep your children 's hair comb with my hand comb
that 's awesome i 'm glad that old sack of s is running the democrats will be eating him alive he 'll be eating them alive there should be some very juicy s coming out about him i mean swimming in nude in front of female fbi agents that is proven that is a fact that you did that kind of s and is funneling and touching and yeah he 's a creep what 's the weather rest of the democrats it 'll be a fun show buckle up
seems like a vanity presidential campaign for the old school democrats just thinking how much money he ’ s going to waste on this makes me cringe
hes really affectionate with kids
totally not creepy
during his first year in law school he was accused of having plagiarized five of 15 pages of a law review article
after graduating law school and becoming an attorney he started a small law practice
slick-tongued and capable of cheating and justifying his transgressions biden had all the prerequisites of becoming a consummate member of the d.c swamp where he could flourish and get in on all the perks
at the age of 30 he went to where the real money was washington d.c having won a senatorial seat in the u.s congress
and i really like joe biden
but candidates have been out there busting their butts for months showing the work they ’ re willing to put in
does he have nothing else better to do
we do n't want more cooperate dems
great i 'll endorse anyone but another republican at this point
i do n't care whether its bernie or biden heck better yet maybe we should put them both in😀..they say 2 heads are better than 1-dum trump 😂😂😂
we 're just friendly
i do like joe and was feeling positive about him running but i have to be honest i am way more on board with mayor pete any this stage
he is more than half joe 's age and is a more exciting prospect in my opinion
great idea msnbc biden is our man
hillary was a better choice at the time
joe was n't interested at the time
geez might as well throw in hillary more corporate sell outs
you mean more of the obama/clinton/deep state crime ring
they all need to stand down make sure bernie2020 beats trump
elizabeth warren the first female commander and chief
good bye joe
i hope very sincerely
trump made humongous tax cuts for the super-rich and now plans to pay for it by taking the money from social security and medicare
new blood is needed
the memes are ready to fire
same old same old
biden has n't had an original idea since never
good luck biden
you 're currently 12 points behind bernie in the latest polls
screw the democratic party old guard‼️
whole to meaning to a touchy feelly president
are u kidding me breaking news biden to announce i think there are far more related breaking news how about after he announces u tell us guys we dont need the clip per clip whateve this is
love uncle joe but i dont know how i feel about this
this should make all the senior citizens of the democratic party happy
biden is the new hillary
trump will easily defeat joe
is this the best the democrats can do
you couldn ’ t close the deal the last two times you ran and the stakes have dramatically changed since then away from you but have fun pretending like you still matter
please creepy joe and commie sanders do n't have a chance economy great unemployment rate is a all time low jobs coming back to usa border protection for the americans and not foreign countries self billionaire and not bought
we all want biden to run as much as we all want gonorrhea
if joe biden wins the nomination i trust democrats will rally around and vote for him
hey i get it we all want our favorite person to be the candidate
will almighty all knowing powerful god tell joe biden depart from me you wicked he-she knows a lot man i never know you
we love ya but i do n't want you to be potus
i 'll be voting trump thanks
they are sooo transparent easy to spot
they attack biden because they fear him the most he poses the greatest threat to trump 's presidency
great
i think if he 'd announced right at the same time as elizabeth warren it might 've caused more of a stir but the public 's moved on now and it feels like he 's that last kid to make it to the three legged race only to find everybody else has already packed up and gone home and it 's started to rain
awesome
is anyone actually excited about this
why ca n't biden stay away from politics stay home and enjoy your good work and money
you 're not going to win a tall not
too old
the new hampshire poll shows bernie taking the lead at 30
biden has made segregationist comments and has an issue with touching and getting too close to women without consent
he wrote and is proud of a crime bill that has scorched the black community
not only is he a hillary and obama friend he started out his campaign by starting a controversial war
slams the president we want a president for action not mouth
if you want a chance for president stay away from talking about guns trump and distance yourself from hillary and obama stand on your own two feet not the backs of others
extremely interested in a joe biden presidency especially if obama is his vice president
good i want him to explain his stated segregationist view i want him to discuss his plans to cut medicare and social security where he agreed with paul ryan how he supported a republican prior to the 2018 congressional election his transgressions against women and his love for the crime bill back in the 90 ’ s that has scorned the black community
ok
why should this guy now supplant any of the highly qualified people already in the race
biden is good on foreign policy and putting russian in check
your corruption involving your son will come to light
if dems do n't stop you now the republicans sure will
any of you seen andrea 's new band called msnbcannibalcorpse lots of pics of her live on stage with them on bitchute
i bet he 's looking up old neil kinnock speeches already
we do n't need more corruption in the wh
clean the swamp
i bet he will keep the president salary not to say he 's going to win but to say he needs more money for hair transplant
i do n't think biden really wants to be president
this is the best thing that could happen to bernie 2020
awesome news for daddy bernie
too many people in the race
lol pedophile joe was supposed to announce weeks ago
he wo n't even win the primary
so i wonder how many more women he will touch up
good
time for new blood to lead our country 🇺🇸🇺🇸
child rapists are popular at msnbc
we need fresh democratic blood in our white house
we need youth relatability “ a today mindset ” we do not need more old fogies we definitely need a more 21st century democratic president not another retiree with same old same old 20th century ideas ideology

Wall

enjoy the caravan
many illegal immigrants work peacefully for years in country clubs
“ i didn ’ t need to do this but i ’ d rather do it much faster ” stormy daniels
okay he 's nuts
well it 's not a f*cking emergency then
confirmed
better go play golf
his stupidity is stunning in his own words he proves its not an emergency its just a campaign issue
brilliant move dude
happy further drowning in lawsuits and investigations
on the wall first it was mexico ’ s going to pay for it then it was american taxpayers we ’ re going to pay then it was the walls built already or most of it now it ’ s a national emergency
if it was a national emergency he could ’ ve declared one when he first got an office
“ i didn ’ t need to do this but i ’ d rather do it much faster ” robert mueller
trump is always finding new ways to throw a tantrum
this president will eventually reveal himself as a true song bird who will sing like a canary
that sounds like kid calling 911 for fun
he said take me to your leader the most powerful and intelligent being on this world
the dems just showed the world how much of a loser he is by making him except a deal where he gets nothing
he must be thinking omg they just grabbed me by my p in front of the whole world this must be a national
emergency this is the perfect time to go to mar o largo play some gulf and try and get my sh t together and do
but i ’ d rather do it much faster ”
me “ so trump if you ’ re giving yourself the option of doing it faster or doing the the wall over a longer period of time and that you really didn ’ t need to declare a national emergency then there really is no emergency
straight out of an snl skit
hes milking the us as much as he can before going to jail
it 's the perfect example of what emergency is
there you go words from a person that just trumped his own national emergency
good luck in the courts your last bet is your friends in the supreme court
so glad i mistakenly put videos on 2x speed 20 minutes ago
gee is this the first time trump actually told the truth
ahh flawless logic national emergency called let ’ s go on vacation
i never promised you a rose garden i beg for emergency but i don ’ t have to
if by any chance any chance trump is reelected in 2020 does n't seem likely but neither did his win in 2016 so who knows and the american people does n't counter that win with a full on revolution you are lost
no wan ist coming to help you
trump-putin filled 2 seats
okay i 'm going golfing
letter to my senators feel free to share with yours
our so-called president gives us shades of jack nicholson in a few good men
you 're goddamned right i did
i better go to florida where i will be safe
lol
now we need to hear from giuliani so he can sink trump right to the bottom
the only impenetrable wall is chump 's want or absolute power
those golf trips ain ’ t cheap you know
melania needs more botox
have a good one folks
this remind me so much of the movie 300 where the politicians refuse to allow the military to guard their country so the king take 300 men to defend the whole country against a million persians
wow
the best part is even if it does n't work the outcome wont be known till after 2020
4d chess in action
the national emergency is kicking this fool out of the office right now before more damage happens to our democracy
“ i didn ’ t need to do this hysterical it never gets old and i laugh every time i watch it d
criticism from the right wing ann coulter sean hannity and rush limbaugh did not approve
trump knows more about technology than anybody
he also knows more about drones than anybody
does n't he know more than our military generals
better than stand up show
why is everybody ok with that
right in the lawsuit
i didn ’ t need to do this but i ’ d rather do it much faster ” melania trump
no one is saying what is really going on with this national emergency and that is the army or national guards are in our state pulling over people asking for identification for no reason
not one coherent sentence he did it he did n't he already built a wall he 's doing it so fast we even did n't notice it
to his wallet more like it
real collusion
2019 is off to a good start bye bye trump
0:26 could some talented person re-mix this into a song
the more ridiculous the better
politically declaring a national emergency is a good move
if he gets his wall this way brett seems to prefer having a more powerful president he will open a can of pain and chaos
the system of checks and balances that our nation relies on to keep the power balanced between the branches if government will take a great hit and the president will become more powerful than congress
outstanding
trump lawyers be like “ yeah he said he didn ’ t have to declare the national emergency but that ’ s not what he really meant ”
i did n't need to do this but it was so easy i just could n't help myself
i did n't need to do this means 'if the congress had done what was best for the country then i would not have needed to do this
how is a méxico paying for a problem the u.s created and that goes way beyond just the two countries fair
but first they need to stop him from building that racist wall
walls worked good way back in the 1800s but this is the 20th century and walls are no longer needed
you must love your electoral college
he just shot down his own argument
disinformation campaign designed to buy ‘ them ’ more time by attempting to ‘ con ’ enough people in order to remove the duly elected potus in order to ‘ save ’ themselves from prosecution
sit back and enjoy the show
raise your right hand if your answer is yes…
just a reminder brian williams lied about that whole iraq/helicopter attack thing
rubbing chin thoughtfully hmmm you know what
i 'm starting to think that our president is somehow maybe not so talented at leadership
so now though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice wolf
as he expected the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture
again the villagers ran to help him only to be laughed at again
the wolf killed a great many of the boy 's sheep and then slipped away into the forest
has anyone ever considered that trump might have found a loophole to get certain contractors he has used to receive government funding to do the
and we know that the emoluments clause has the legal strength of wet toilet paper
make sure you vote and generate as many votes that you can
a sincere thank you for the honesty mr president
and lol at your breach of leadership kayfabe
true the show must go on but we are about to go full improv as the young progressives take the stage
does this sound familiar
early signs of dementia
difficulty finding the right words
difficulty completing normal tasks
trump is really borat
dude you did zero wall hahaha
instead of something significantly immediately pressing trump might think of this as a continual ongoing crisis evaluated in annual accumulated terms to persistently keep resolutely moving ahead regardless of opposition and obstructions
like the old aesop fable of the tortoise and the hare trumps real supporters anticipate eventual win
trumps next move is lock himself in the oval office with 2 years worth of hamburders
what trump was doing there with that cadence is called up talking and was very popular in the 1980 's in san fernando valley in ca otherwise being popularized by valley girls
so it 's a national emergency but trump did n't need to act quickly
we really have entered some kind of alternate universe
russia must really need that money
that whole nonsense rambling raising pitch at the end like 10 times was true senile behavior
this group has proven to be large enough to be able to steer the us on a really dangerous path
i believe we need sufficiently effective border security/walls/barriers however i also believe
his logic about proper time place to use necessary tools is equal to using his wife 's washing machine to mix concrete
you can do it but that does not mean you should 🙄🙄🙄
the first thing the next president should do is to declare a national emergency citing a certain state propaganda news channel as a danger to society and shut the fox up
he spends more time on being re elected than what he does actually working huh and duh good luck gop seriously
trumpty-dumpty had a great fall again
what 's trump 's true agenda 🤔for those billions or for that wall ⛑🤐😱🧟‍♀️
just blabbing n gossiping wo n't do but what are their highest educational level
i have to say that from an outsider 's view president trump is a walking disaster for your constitution and is viewed as a joke by most nations in the world
this latest move just reinforces our opinion that he has no idea what he 's doing and the only way you can make america great again is to get rid of him
good luck america you 're going to need it
and despite the stupidity of trump he 'll win in 2020 by saying he is against abortion
exceptional reporting brian.👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
thank you being real with us
like a loving caring parent to the whole nation
we love you sir
we will make you proud
trump is so far out of his depth it is simply staggering
my company hired 30 new people last year because of trumps policy
the real national emergency is the president of the united states
everyone who bought trumps book the art of the deal has a right to get their money back
for sure
‪trump to base-did you see the way i sucked up to william barr the new attorney general after i declared a national emergency
the mueller report will never see the light of day if he got my clear message to be as loyal to me as whitaker
you can really see how dumb americans are in the comments on these videos and the press is n't much better either
trump is looked upon as someone undermining world peace and order more then vladimir putin by all of our allies that have stood side by side with america for the past century
the supreme court rewrote the ban to pass and he claims a win typical baby trump
this goes directly against the constitution
take it right to the supreme court
let them decide right now if we are a democracy or a tyranny
then we the people can respond quickly to resolve the issue if they don ’ t
congress needs to submit resolution of disapproval put a complete stop to his declaration
no executive action required
and soon very soon he will self destruct
if the president has the right to declare a national emergency then he should be able to speak freely even if the verbalized intentions are deemed unconstitutional
haha
what is amazing is that enough people were conned into voting for him
they must have believed the apprentice was real lol
a fool shooting himself in his foot with his own gun
stupidity at its best
that pootin has better ideas and that fox and friends are his best sources for national security intelligence not you
how degrading for you the elected officials of a still free nation
wow trump is reaaaally desperate to win back ann coulter with this stunt
building inside your core for stability and as a hole needs to be established as one all countries need to build there core and economic value
trump has sucked the media in again and has changed the narrative from the real national emergency
and it reminds me that we don ’ t hear much about organize crime in the county because it ’ s all in washington
he admitted his entire motivation is his own re-election
selfish egotistic man puts his own re-election above the american people
if trump really wants the wall why does n't he put a 1 billion down payment for the wall
if he appropriated money from his secret service protection and his personal fortune he 's really rich he says so all the time into this vanity project i doubt there would be so much complaining
wow
in the last two years he 's gotten fatter and crazier and with alzheimer in his family 's history i 'd say he 'll be in a nursing home before the 2020 elections that is if we are lucky
if this is how trump misappropriated funds from his own empire what makes others think that he would not apply the same method to americans hard earned tax dollars
he does not contribute to any funds in the country by way of paying his taxes so he will never understand how best to manage it
at this rate and if allowed to get away with this he would surely bankrupt the country the way he has done to most of his business
how many lawsuits does trump face now
collective punishment is when the acts of 1 person represents their whole race or religion
paddock las vagus country concert killer 64-year-old white man from mesquite nevada fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay hotel killing 58 people and leaving 851 injured – over 400 of them by gunfire and hundreds more in the ensuing panic
president trump should have the wall built then fine the people who do n't like it 800 each
did he not think that the opposition lawyers would use this against him in the court case challenging his emergency declaration
you are allowing this man to laugh your country into disaster
he sounds like a 2 year old 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
a great deal maker
why does trump sound like a 6-year-old giving santa his wish list
el chapo just mentioned names big names on the left hillary cl nancy p adam s and many others no wonder the left want open border they need it for drug running ✝️✝️
is trump trying to talk like an seo expert to get more hits
does he not realize seo is n't used on live tv
i have a family living near me who immigrated here from honduras last year
but no they opened up their own metal fabricating business
most of what the father does is make new metal parts for old cars and turcks
immigration seems to be bringing along with it new innovations new ways to get things done and make america better
maybe america is smarting up and will elect a democrat president next time
whadda mean to be fair mexico was supposed to pay for the wall
good news
what is truly stunning to me is 1/3 of the population of america believes this fool is capable of leading their country dumbasfuck
he will be fired by his real employers if he does n't stop going off script
that moment you have this idea of going off script thinking you are so much smarter than everyone else is when you simply f up
trump was able to manipulate and excersise his narcissism in his private life but will not be tolerated much longer on the grander scale as president
lol 😂 he always wins at the end
he only knows how to win people i know it hurts some of you
today i spoke with a woman whose aunt has 1 house in el paso and 1 in juarez and my first thought is she can cross to mexico get affordable healthcare
we 're becoming a banana republic
guy is more intelligent than people think
white house staff should resign en bloc since they are unable to stop trump from for acting above the law and constitution with his latest executive order
maybe like republican lawmakers they need to secure their positions to support him at all costs
trump will win
good job trump we ’ re behind you
long live trump
this is the first time i 've witnessed trump screw up and i give him a pass
by declaring a national emergency any funds appropriated from other sources is completely outside of the bills parameters and restrictions.thereby meaning money that is reallocated elsewhere can be used to build walls wherever president trupm wants
the bill does nothing to stop trump from using his presidential powers under a national emergency declaration to appropriate money by himself from the defense budget this money can be spent anywhere potus desires
completely getting around restrictions.president trump can build walls elsewhere for the next 7 months when bill expires and then return to build the walls in restricted areas after the stipulations expire
obama was so much of a putin puppet that he signs a national emergency helping russia
lol
we 're liberals and we know whats best
if it is not an emergency then why did democrats give 1.3 billion for a not-emergency wall more money than trump knows what to do with for other border stuff
it would appear that democrats just do n't want to 'fund trump 's campaign promise knowing that a wall of any kind would work and make democrats look like liars
prove that walls do n't work i 'm willing to believe ya
what works too well is america 's social welfare services being depleted for foreigners us unfunded liabilities currently more than 122 trillion in debt
i wonder how many more tax dollars spent on ileagles crime and murders of the american people are willing to let happen

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Synagogue shooting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
so glad to hear that the number of casualties was far less than it could have been but even one casualty was too many
i salute the brave people in the synagogue for acting when they did they undoubtedly saved many lives
when i first seen the title i thought the mayor died
sending love and solidarity from pittsburgh
there is a good feeling that radiates at that corner of shady and wilkins but i never realized it until the attack on tree of life
i do n't live in the neighborhood anymore but it remains close to my heart and it really hurt to see what happened there and the rebuilding goes onward
i have nothing but compassion and sympathy for the good people of poway
that 's incredible
the hero 's were n't cops lets make that very clear
and give him any kind of fame or whatever
ramona here sending love to our poway neighbors
19 year old is too young to buy alcohol but old enough to acquire a firearm and go on a shooting spree
right after the nra speech 😒 got ta look sideways
guess gun free zones work pretty well from what i can tell here
keep guns in the hands of criminals and keep guns away from normal people
these guys are n't doing anything except for ruining lives and making gun laws more strict smh
rip to the 1 person that died and i hope everybody is ok
wow so glad those gun laws working in comifornia
good job saying absolutely nothing whilst talking
captain america grows old and retires
not even the most restricted gun laws ca n't stop a shooting
but what kind of gun was it
asking the important questions huh
prayers for those injured their families and the family who lost a loved one
san diego police live in poway california
narrative shift media leak strsgety catching up with msnbc
i am glad you have a close knit community
i 'm interested in how
interesting that trumpster rhymes with dumpster must be some of those good people trump alludes to for sure
this is not going to look good for the anti-semitic democrat party
best believe gun confiscation is somehow the end agenda
interesting
my deepest sorrow for loved ones
well this was unexpected
when they give no information at all we know what 's really going on
another example of the advantages of having someone armed in a building being attacked and saving many lives
first this then unc charlotte
this really needs to stop
so close to home i live in el cajon about 25-35 min to poway
huge mayor balls
for all the people who think this is real send me a dm
i find it rather interesting that you never get to hear the shooters comments
this right here is why concealed carry is important
good job of asking who the shooter was
toxic not a good joke
yo dats kinda scary lmao
good thing someone was in the synagogue with a gun to stop him
imagine if society was comfortable with people walking around with guns on their belt like in older times
whenever a psycho pops up they would be quickly neutralized
you can really hear the pain and shock in the mayors voice
california has the most strict gun control in the nation already
exactly what i ’ d do smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
thank goodness the rabbi is ok condolences to the family of the departed
if this man is proven to be part of an organized group someone better return the favor to its members
may all beings be free from suffering
what a great time to be an athiest
well guessing the fatality is the puke responsible so save your prayers for the rabbi who got shot in the hand
i live in powayy
he knows absolutely nothing
all he did was spew rhetorical bs about how safe his town is and wonderful the police are
poway california has more kkk living there
wow this is right outside my neighborhood
like i know ya really want it but ya pretend ya don ’ t lol cause i talk about it but meh bills come first before everything
awesome
totally awesome
goes to show a gun in your hand is worth more than 100 cops with guns five minutes away
it 's amazing how some politicians wash people 's brain in order to use them for their personal goals and get away with it and the saddest thing is that we like a great nation that we are allow them to play with us like a herd of lambs
i live near sd we go their almost 2 times every month glad we didnt go today
americans we need to come together not hate
it do n't matter what kind of gun was used
aghh another shooting 😑 this is getting very old 😒
looks like people love guns more than life itself
may this sweet lady rip and god bless all the wounded and give them a quick recovery
i have nothing nice to say
so many shooting issues in america
oh wow normal citizens using effective self defense to save lives
hmm gee golly gosh i was told we were incapable of being that responsible
i 'm sure congressman ted lieu can cut together an audio clip of candace owens doing it
i was at the orthodox church right next door
this indicates some political agendas are in place which needed to be justified may be war somewhere we will probably see in next few months
then i am lucky
first the new zealand mosque then the sri lanka churches and now this
just let everyone practice their own religions and let them pray in peace
how many thoughts and prayers are we going have here
one thing im learning is to stay away from major populated places
cop are rarely on the scene as a crime is underway they show up after the fact
that mirror has a good publicist
i used to live in poway
i used to live in poway
the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
yes yes we know zionist jews are the 'extra special important chosen-worthy their safety is always our primary concern
looks like those gun laws worked out really well
good job liberals your laws saved somebody
democarcy is so wonderful
it brings so much advancement and safety to society
keep up the good work us of a
it ’ s the left and obola who did more than any other pres
to divide this country since the civil war it ’ s what he did best
ok let 's get it over with saving you from the usual nra denials
whys this whole thing just seem rather scripted
forgot where i saw this before live by the sword die by the sword
transmitting my thoughts and payers to the loved ones of the victims via satellite
this is a prime example of a mass shooting being prevented by a good guy with a gun stoppi ng a bad guy with a gun
on a day devoted to love redemption and renewal we pray for the victims and stand with the people of california
poway is a nice city
god is great
beer is good
i blame donald j trump and steve bannon for the atmosphere that fosters this kind of madness
god preserve us to be able to see the end of this hateful administration
and to make it even worse bernie would be ok with this pos being able to vote from prison
thanks bern
yet they claim to be the peaceful ones
yet another place of worship killing and yet another done with the 'massacre special ar15
just days ago trump doubled down on his very fine people comment relative to the charlottesville disgrace
the jews got off easy this time
the growing truth of history with unstoppable momentum gaining more speed daily
lol
as long as we have a raging antisemite in congress condemnations of this violence simply don ’ t ring true
now now before we jump to any conclusion i 'm sure there were some very fine people on both sides
let 's not just hear one side of the story we should not make a judgement until we hear stories from these fine people on both sides
does n't ca have very strict gun laws how did this happen
we want to see the shooting video or some real evidence for once not talking heads and crisis actors
why is it we do not hear the truth about jew phobia and christian phobia that are claiming more lives than the other phobias
msnbc is been a huge contributor to stirring hatred and division in our country
this years left-fueled race wars are pretty astounding
only good guy with a gun could stop a bad guy with a gun
but they have laws againt having guns how do they shoot when they not allowed to own guns
my grandmother always insisted it was a safe town but i kept telling her that nowhere is safe
ofcourse he would ask about what kind of gun was used in the shooting trying to find some way to make this political and shock the viewers to get more for the ratings shameful
the mayor gave a good response very professional
lol
great more fake shootings
trump said he ’ s a fine person
stop giving them attention thats exactly what they want
what a great president there 's a shooting spree in a synagogue and he goes to a rally right after
whenever they attack god 's chosen its always old and senile victims and a very low body count
the so called right at it again
so full of love are n't they
do n't we all want 4 more years of this
it does n't matter if guns become illegal mass shooting/killings will still happen unless we focus on the real problem the shooters/human beings
i am more interested in finding out who was influencing bullied/abused and corrupted him
thank you for reading my comment my fellow human being who is tired of this too
we know that your country is so out of control just showing this on tv will only make more
the view count on this almost nothing burger issue is highly suspect
the police are still only the clean up crew
do n't worry all of this third world sanctuary country is safe
radical right wing terrorist
but kommiefornistan has all those super duper strict gun laws
and the mommies demanding attention say a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun
a man opened fire inside a san diego synagogue saturday and a good
striking his vehicle ”
thanks trump
nice
good people need to think offensively not just defensively
what kind of weapon did the shooter use
the media will give this a lot more attention then it ever gave to the 380 easter worshippers that died in siri lanka
pro-zionist catholic here and positive white guy antisemitism and antichristianism both must not be tolerated
this church is going to make serious bank/money off of sympathy and sht also tax free pray the lord for guilt
liberals should love this most of them hate jews
why do these disturbed individuals want to hurt innocent people
they will forget really soon about this
poway is and was a very conservative enclave in a very conservative part of san diego county
another great day america hurray😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
all religions preach love as long as you believe in what they believe or else
we need to make sure that kids are educated about slavery the holocaust and other tragedies because some dont seem to have been awake during classes
and we need to make sure that racism is condemned especially when the president does n't seem to care
is this what trump meant by make america great again
these kind of attacks have increased over the last few years did something change is there some reason these attacks have increased
fake news california has many gun free zones
the media covered this story more than the three black churches burned in louisiana
thanks omar for amplifying all this anti jewish rhetoric
this was more of a homicide than a shooting
after not finding any other more interesting news for an hour i am now watching it
but more importantly how did i and perhaps many of you go so desensitized
i wonder if mass attacks hate/terrorist attacks regardless of the method assault riffle bomb knife vehicle etc and attempted or successful murder of a police officer result in a mandatory fast track death sentence once convicted would result in fewer incidences like these
and not an easy death but perhaps the same way they killed their victims
while we definitely need gun laws that better protect public health
i live in a red midwestern state
my family in the police dept tells me we r 146 officers short bc our republican legislature has thrown out most all gun laws or they r told not to enforce them and allow open carry just about anywhere which has made the jobs of police officers much more dangerous and resulted in fewer and fewer ppl signing up for the police academy
from what i understand many cities throughout the country r having the same issue
luckily it was the gun owner who was shot in the leg
i could go on forever w/examples of how loosening the gun laws has lead to more ppl being shot and killed over the stupidest reasons
in addition the number of ppl leaving guns in cars or even unsecured guns in homes has allowed criminals access to more guns all the guns they could ever want which had lead to minor males using these guns during crimes like carjackings
clearly an event took place
i live in poway
it ’ s such a quite and great place to live
this is what happens when you watch too many conspiracy videos on youtube and read too many conspiracy nutjob blogs online
some very fine folks on both side of the divide
it ’ s almost 2020 and people are still murdering each other for religions that aren ’ t even real
huge cream pies
how come whenever there 's a mass shooting it gets so much attention but when there are n't any casualties no one seems to talk about it
to have the maturity and humanity to live and let live
however it ’ s very interesting how all these white shooters are always taken into custody
weaponry can give you a real advantage if you are trained highly qualified in its use
maybe you disagree that 's okay
i 've had dealings with police both personally professionally
the best response time i ever saw was two minutes 35 seconds but the other times were never less than a half-hour
killing over religion is older than jesus
even quiet town usa is n't safe
the most likely suspect is ilhan omar and her incestuous brother/husband
how did this hate-filled 19 yr old get a gun
who are the parents of the ninteen year old who did this
its the parents fault most of all
nobody wants that
guns will keep murdering innocent folks for times to come
now if only we had concealed carry laws the gunman would have been dead after the first shot
no i ’ m sure it happened because he loved it so much
why do u think many are moving out of california all over california
i am so happy that not that much people died but r.i.p the person who did die
tolerance love and compassion have gone by the wayside
only a coward would shoot up any peaceful place of worship
why is it that people love to say karma is a b but then when things like this happen the theory is thrown right out the window
build the wall take the guns then your freedom and tax you thats the plan its called the new world order it aint new and it certainly aint short on order
i hope for the best i really do
christians are becoming terrorists again
the one responsible is trump cause he gets on twitter and start ranting and telling his brainless followers that everyone is the enemy of the people but yet there 's no consequences for him right smfh wake up people this wo n't be the last time this happens this is why trump needs to be taken off the office
why do they have the most holidays in the states
god is pouring out he judgement on this world for there wickedness.it will not get better you have not seemed nothing yet.god is in control
we need to stop trump 's 'very fine people
its been confirmed
what is the freaking point of hurting innocent people you don ’ t even know who have done nothing to you
there ’ s no place in a civilized society for violence except in self defense or war
i would say “ thoughts and prayers ” etc which i do have but something more is required
so all 3 major ibrahimic religious groups took a shooting in their religious buildings within barely even 2 months the world really is coming to an end
it is now doubly important for the democratic party to get a handle on some of the rhetoric coming out in recent days from their ranks
saying jews are like cockroaches or that they control the finances of the country in a nefarious way these are old antisemitic tropes that have no place in politics
i hope the right people get the message
i am not a dummy and they show poor taste in their timing.in a couple of years or less cnn will be a thing of the past and people will laugh about the morons who tried to sell themselves as news casters.cnn was good at the beginning of the war in iraq but then went way left and became extremely hateful to americans who did not agree on their views.maybe a good station for california that is if california still has electricity and people willing to work
you mean to tell me that another guy with a gun at the right place and time prevented more deaths from happening
interesting is n't it
killing any innocents is like killing whole humanity saving one innocent is like saving whole humantiy holy quran
1 dead in a country of almost 400 million quick let 's make this breaking news so we can tarnish the 2nd amendment even though it happened in one of the most gun free zones in america
no single religion culture or race has all the answers
no religion is safe
no musician is safe on stage
the only good jew is a dead one
welp get ready somehow i ’ ll be to blame for this just for being white and male
is n't that right obama and omar
“ this was just after passover ” oh the holiday you celebrate that remembers god killing all first born boys in egypt
i do n't know if anyone shoots people out of love
i 'm sure president trump will be blamed for this shooting
i 'm sure this will be ammunition for the gun grabbing crowd
well if this violence against jews continues we will have to put them all into concentration camp for their own safety until we can sort this all out
the gunman called the police to report the shooting and he was taken alive
wow
these people are real comfortable with carrying out mass shootings or what was intended to be a mass shooting and behave as though it is nothing
they are not mentally ill and this is not a gun problem
let 's not blame the guy but did but clearly the guy who told him to go do it
cause clearly that 's all dems do
they would have to be there being shot for them to believe this is real
really is sad that even the most unlikely of places are not safe to practice religion enjoy free time and just being with friends and family
you ca n't be safe anywhere anymore
stay strong jewish brothers
america knows this yet they refuse to clean this vermin out
more of those good people
now more than ever the country needs to come together to support the jewish community and israel
i think killing a few palis and bulldozing several homes would be an appropriate response
but sure let ’ s keep allowing everyone and anyone to purchase military grade weapons
awesome idea
churches in california are suppose to be gun free i mean did this shooter even have his ccw did he get a background check
it was another white trump supporter that wants the wall
jews have different political beliefs and different beliefs in general that they try and push on people and nobody is interested and nobody likes them that is why people like this break and do things like this
ilhan omar and rashida tlaib are having a very good year
much to celebrate
i 'm so glad this happened i wish he got a higher score
i was in a restaurant today and heard a guy say their are good muslims out there
god bless all this good people and please god take trump with you
good
if it is not a hate crime how does the msm expect to un-ring the bell
people are just minding their own business in church and some asswhipe comes in to shoot them because they believe in a religion that they does n't like
watch how his actions are gon na be ideologies of the alt right
lol california sucks
these never ending attacks against different religions primarily christians is ridiculous but jesus warned us this would happen
if you ’ re alive and breathing ask for forgiveness and change your ways
breaking news trump rally is very huge in wisconsin
if a straight white guy msm will be talking about this for months
trump must apologize for and denounce his statement that there were fine people on both sides in charlottesville because it emboldens white supremacists and neo nazis
he absolutely must
the people in the comments calling these abrahamic parasites peaceful
and no muslim terrorists could have done it because the main slime media folks are scared shitless to even suggest that possibility just like sri lanka and paris
right wing trolls are rotten to the core trying to spin this
now it is confirmed he is white the spin is getting out of control
smh you wonder why those guys are really early trolling when these kind of events happen
everyone buy more guns
be ready for any situation
lol
these demon rats never talk about the christian onslaught by mohamadite dogs who have no shame and scream out to satan afterwards or during their hatred while their being posessed to do so how many christian churches have been attacked over the last few weeks by these dogs
msnbc is partly responsible for creating the antisemitism that caused this tragedy
i thought criminals obeyed laws once they were in place my mind is completely blown by the fact that ca gun laws are n't ending shootings
any thoughts as to what kind of assault rifle he used
lmao
one of the fine jews will not replace us people
lol
10 bucks it ’ s a right winger
which god will win the battle
why msnbc is not reporting lot of christian who dies in many countries of the worl
the guy is confused he calls himself a christian and that jesus christ inspired him to do it many quotes from bible he hates anti-white trump etc etc
must be one of those fine people trump was telling us about
good people with guns stop bad people with guns
stop taking guns away from good people
hate crime is the best
only good jew is a dead jew
the drama and stories that come from those two states is more than all the other states combined
maybe he was made that the jews did n't give trump the best property in the new settlement they named after donnie
funny how the death toll of 1 overshadows the death toll of over 250 at a catholic church in sri lanka
is that not a hate crime
suspect is 19 year old white male
filming propaganda drills and paid crisis actor's presenting it to the american people as a real event lol
california has the most gun restrictions in the country
get ready for another push to take the guns
ffs this so called religion is nothing even close to peace all they do is teach intolerance and hatred for anyone who is not like them but the left just defends them till their eyes bleed smh its not racist if its true
when is it too many shootings in america
not one of them can be counted on to serve the will of their voters as opposed to their donors which is why it seems like we 're screaming into the wind and until we get that money out of our politics we ca n't expect anything to even begin to change even as we sit in our comfortable recliners watching yet another mass shooting news report
how many dead in chicago this year alone
think about it easter new zealand and now this i think the president should ban synagogue in america because this will keep going and going
i wonder when those young white guys from charlotville are going to protest trump
the nra is already arguing he should be able to keep his guns
you 2nd amendment defenders need to start policing your own or the greater population will turn on you
white trump supporter means trump wont be tweeting or mentioning this latest domestic-terror act
his therapist should be proud
okay done
this is old news all this has already been warned and told about
fortunately msnbc decided to immediately devote some time for this after giving no coverage to the slaughter of 200 christians just last week
they should elect a muslim president and he will have 8 yrs of peace like 2008-16 not a single rioting looting everything made about race to support criminal behavior while being anti police every other week
and to think those right wing extremist bums who commit these heinous crimes are the same ones who are trying to convince us that all muslims are terrorists and that we are all in danger from them very sad and ironic indeed
wow
these guys should remove their maga hats after these terrorist acts so they wo n't be so quickly caught
i 'm going out on a limb and say that trump is going to say that there were fine people on both sides
i 'm glad this happened
that ’ s why you need to stay arm to protect yourself and love ones
i have 18 grand that if he voted it was for trump
commufornia should ease up on gun laws so more can carry and take care of attackers much quicker
if mohammed was truly a descendant of abraham he would not encourage the destruction of his own heritage
a real president would start fighting back against the alt-right but the orange blight thinks that they are fine people 🤬👹💩
expect more ffs in the coming weeks stay vigilant and safe
we say 'oh just one died but that is one too many
the rothchilds own the news media outlets
he is white and he is 19 and ofcourse he is mentally unstable got ta be great to be white you can even get away with terrorism
i bet trump fly 's all the way out there just because of one dad jew
why do people assume everything they see on the news really happened
trumps fine people attack helpless people
don ’ t really care for california
as a wise man once said 60 million died in ww2
why did only 6 million of them become important
it would be mostly gangs and let them shoot each other its solving the problem themselves
the passover is observed for 1 day only the following day begins the high shabbat of the feast of unleavened bread which runs for 7 days
amerikkka you can thank the white right republikkkans for this
let 's all give credit to the nra with republicans and the right wing propaganda machine support for seeing to it that every psycho and terrorist could get all the guns and ammo they want knowing that they will never be held accountable
how many have the fbi caught in the last year
and there will be more
these are trumps fine people
sadly many commenters use this to offer pretend trump quotes to blame him
interesting that when a massive coordinated attack by wealthy and privileged islamist against christian killing 300 get far less coverage and is esentially ignored by msnbc one article a day later than a terrorist who kills 1 person at synagog
well if n.y times did n't post so much anti semitism stuff like this would n't happen
there is no other explanation
has the msm every put so much energy into a shooting involving an atheist who happened to be murdered buy a person of faith
this is more msm bs
more atheist have been killed by gun violence than people of faith this year
everything else it doesn ’ t matter even if it ’ s little children getting massacre at a elementary school in connecticut
we know nbc and media makes up stories all the time but that fabricated story was way too obvious someone needs to be fired so you can hire better photo editors and art directors to create your stories

Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
this building is sooooo beautiful inside and outside and it ’ s been iconic in parisian history
we used to have this picture in our history book part of indian social studies syllabus as kids we used to get awed by this cathedral
i have hope in french govt they will do a great job in restoring this
so much history and relevance to the entire world gone in the blink of an eye paris we stand with you in sorrow and unity 🙏🏽
it ’ s indescribably magnificent
one of the world 's most beautiful buildings
the glass was incomparable
this is the most visited cathedral in europe this is a hit to the whole of human civilization
this is astounding
it was my first time
norte dame is not just a cathedral it is a symbol of western knowledge and the site of one of the first universities in the modern world
this has much greater symbolic significance than most people are prepared to understand
a absolute nightmare
the world is watching we love you
the most visited 30k per day monument in france is up in flames
i´m a full grown man now but this hurts this really hurts like a punch in your guts and soul
hope for the best
for nearly 1000 years it ’ s stood
i visited noter dame caterdral in 2018 it was very good and beautiful its to sad its on fire
i hope they will be able to rebuild
this is a gorgeous building
i ’ ve been there and it is so sad because it is the most recognizable and beautiful cathedral
hold the cross high so i may see it through the flames
a beautiful cavaille-coll organ is in there
this is very sad 😓😓😓
i am glad i had a chance to see this church building
now i want to watch the hunchback of notre dame just to watch the amazing detail
just more european history down the drain
i ca n't tell you how many times i have been in the notre dame
the building is just amazing
was amazing
this is a great loss
insert burzum music in the background and enjoy
literally a river right next to it
wow ken was one of the last people to be inside the notre dame cathedral
unfortunately，historical artifacts are great，i hope that you can rebuild this great building，from china，if there is a rebuilding donation i will definitely donate 1,000 euros even though i am only a student
i was just there last november notre dame was such a magnificent architectural wonder
montrez-leur que votre main ne tarde pa guérir et à restaurer
right omar
850 years old charge survived history franc
same happened in brazil something ai n't right
it 's just a building but there is sooo much history people stories tied to it
huge loss for all of us
coincidentally during this easter happened where the people from entire world needed it most survived many wars and revolutions for 855 years and yet it burned for an instance
this was good to see 😉
as a muslim we with you in this precious loss and condolence
notre dame is so hot right now
this is astounding
through many years and hard work that church did rise
i just hope that there are thorough detailed studies and inventory and reproductions of every item and surface of notre dame because this fire is going to melt the stained glass windows turn all the wood and paintings into ash blow up the stone and statues
it took 2 hours for the fire brigades to arrive and the free mason media has already stated no arson is involved
because they are free masons n free masons burnt the churche before good friday cause they know millions will be praying at that very church
but all must be more sad that years ago we lost 5 thousand year old historical in iraq and syria
thank god france is a big time supporter of christianity unlike cnn and much of the media
all the people that will rebuild the cathedral with the catholic community is a great thing
it is just a sign that a century is finished when this holy place turned into ashes but new century is going to start so it will be rebuilt and more history will be added on that is why we have more books to reads
just seeing such a beautiful and historic landmark getting destroyed makes me sad
this better not be a terrorist attack
the history and all the darkness from the church is coming to an end wonder what their trying to hide now these kind of buildings just dont burn like this
thats an attack against christianity its not just notre dam its many more churches around france
the bells the bells bit of a coincidence that quasi went out to buy a duck not long after the fire started just saying
if so then who would be most suspect hmmm someone who hates christianity maybe a group new to france that does n't hold this place sacred
it 's not about how much we lost its about how much we have left
allah blessed this day made space for a new mosque
yeah right a church satan
wow
that hunchback 's organ solo really was fire
the job of msnbc is to narrate how completely gone it is and make the world believe it 's an accident
i was planning on going to paris and seeing it when i was older but now it ’ s just
serves them right for all those boy rapes they 've committed and covered up for decades
so very heartbreaking
love and prayers to parisians and france
a cherished landmark and artistic treasure that graced the landscape for centuries
very upsetting for art and history lovers the world over.😭
the best way to know why is happened is what decision will be made
truly a huge loss for paris france and the rest of the world
really i 'm at a loss for words
this place religious or not is such an iconic and storied historic landmark
and in the southern city of nimes near the spanish border vandals looted the altar of the church of notre-dame des enfants our lady of the children and smeared a cross with human excrement
this is so sad many years ago me and my sister visited notre dame cathedral it is one the beautiful place to visit when you are in paris
first the rise of religious violence in france now the catholic church burns down..i wonder..before that 17 march another church almost burnt down bring the immigrants you guys are doing well wakaka
the french your soldiers killed and destroyed in many aggressive wars
the right thing to do is to rebuild the notre dame cathedral
so many people 's ancestors were baptized and have taken faith in paris because of the notre dame cathedral
french people religious or not need to stand up do what truly is right
also anyone who commited this crime those involved should be brought to justice and be permanently held responsible
good lord there are so many idiots here in the comments bringing politics into this
one year after the great east japan earthquake of march 11 2011 we know that about 2,000 people such as the citizens of paris attended and the mass was dedicated to the affected areas of the japan and the victims in the notre dame cathedral
we wish you all the best in this hard time
i don ’ t live in paris in france but i ’ m a catholic and christian and this hurts because i never got to see the inside of this building and reading the comments i don ’ t know if i every was going to see it but now i wish i had seen the inside of it because it sounds like it was really beautiful and pretty inside
million of 3rd world muslim economic refugees welcomed to europe what did you expect
wow
there goes a real piece of history
that building is more than 800 years old
why is having them more important than our lives or civil rights
despite the ignorant americans who make fun of the french or the changing political atmosphere we the people of the united states have always stood with the people of france in fraternity and liberty
our nation was founded upon their principles and our founding fathers stood side-by-side with the french as we gained our own liberty and freedom
it 's sad to see such a magnificent structure burning but buildings can be rebuilt
the french are so dramatic i just heard a french guy on the news compare this to september 11th lmao
nobody even died and nobody outside of france really cares
i ’ m supposed to go to paris in exactly one month i can already tell my experience is going to be greatly altered
i know how much this place means to them it means so much to many others around the world
i hope quasimodo made it out safely
enjoy islam french people
in france since the beginning of february there have been more than 10 attacks on christian churches some burned and other suffering acts of desecration
investigators confirmed that the march 18th fire was started deliberately
seems prophetic with all the allegations against the catholic church what is next for this great religion that has shaped our humanity can it find a porpoise again
i 'm kind of interested will notre dame be the joan of arc 2019 will it help rally france in the midst of the yellow jackets
certainly with such a monument of humanity emanual macron the radical centerist will have the sympathies of the world
this the perfect visual of the current state of france
our prayers are with quasimodo right now
i hope the hunchback got out ok
wow i love old building 's this is just sad the only thing i could say about this is like 9/11 all over again and just imagine if the white house was in this kind of destruction the people of not just france but world are completely traumatized by this it 's good that no one was killed and you know what else it always seem 's that it 's predicted in some type of media look back movies like the hunch back of notre dame and the ending of the valley of gwangi nobody could have ever think that something like this would ever happen and i do n't know what could happen next this year i hope everyone stays safe and is ok well maybe in the future this landmark will rise from the ashes of destruction
a 859 year old building does n't just magically catch fire foul play is in order
honestly i still don ’ t get why they aren ’ t using planes
most likely the cathedral will burn down
do n't worry after it burns down they will replace it with a beautiful mosque
i think it should keep burning as it is this is amazing what a spectacle
wonderful
i truly think it was an accident during renovations but iam happy i was n't the only one who kept getting hunchback of notre dame images
cool video
another culturally enriched situation
second most iconic structure of paris is gone
rebuilding it with new engineers will simply not bring back the old glory
the police have better water cannons than firemen but they only use those on the yellow vest protesters
ihr seit beschämend mir fällt nichts anderes dazu ein überall auf der welt sterben menschen chaos wo mann nur hin guckt und eure kommentare dazu nichts aber eine gebäude brennt und ihr weint fast eure herzen sind tod schamhaft traurig sehr traurig 😢
wish many pedofiles burned alive there
how did this place catch on fire in the first place
where is the hunchback gon na live now
who do you think is responsible for this
is quasimodo ok
massive timber construction tons of stain paints just wow huge historical loss
eu loving macron is a curse on france
i 'm sure it 's just an accident right before easter
have friends that live there live chatting with them right now as i write this
when asked what other religious groups they are discussing they said really jerry you need to ask that
should be interesting to see what transpires over the next day or so and see what the actual cause is
i am sure msnbc and rachel maddog will try to blame this on trump and then tie it to the russia investigation
i know quite logically that many of the world 's great structures will be underwater and otherwise destroyed in just a few decades but watching the flames destroy this feat of mankind built for the greater glory is truly a gut wrenching moment
cultural enrichment
the perfect metaphor for france right now
ilhan omar and jussie smollett said they seen 2 white guys wearing red hats yelling this is maga country running away from notre dame right when the fire began
for mighty is the lord god who has judged her ”
9 and the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning
10 they will stand far off in fear of her torment and say
you great city
you mighty city babylon
i wonder where eu and france was when 100s of serbian monasteries and churches were burned by albanians in kosovo and metohija monasteries and churches who were older than notre dame itself
hopefully macron does the right thing and build a mosque there so that france 's ostracized migrant community can finally have some semblance of contributing to french culture
the muslim french community deserve that and more
the structural damage must be huge
it would be easier to replace the eiffel tower than this old stone structure
i doubt even the free masons have people to recreate this masterpiece
i 'm surprised msnbc has n't said that trump was spotted running from the building
beautiful
well well well i wonder who could be responsible for this hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
the spirit of all the deceased orphaned children molested by the spiritual hands that 's supposed to love them
they ’ ll get thousands of police on a mosque shooting in nz but zero response is just ‘ natural ’ when it comes to burning cultural landmarks of christendom europa
score more points for cultural enrichment
msnbc where 's morning joe his opinion will really matter
the serbian people are praying and expressing their sincere sorrows for the loss of this church
which is as old as the serbian churches deliberately destroyed in 1999
that is the truth in love
serves president macron right for his attitude to mrs may during brexit justice served french frogs 🇬🇧🇬🇧
probably an incendiary device with a delayed timer left by general dietrich von choltitz
hey msnbc why are n't you streaming president trump 's roundtable on economic reform
this is the first relevant and realnews story that msnpc has reported in 2 1/2 years
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the 1 peter 4:17
this is what is happening in this world all holyness being engulfed in flames well never be able to create something like that ever again

so now the yellow-wests can begin doing something positive for a change cleanup rebuild
i have no sad feelings for anything roman catholic burning
aoc thinks its really cool
how come that the fire spreads so fast
how is it possible if it started from some unique location
it would have been localized and put down then am i right
democrats launch full investigation
the house of self righteous self-serving selfish christians burning down i guess it is going to be a good day
very interesting timing
its not burning up as fast as the united states is with old tinyhands at the helm
free assange or more stuff will magically catch on fire
free assange
do n't y'all find it very ironic and symbolic that all these church fires happened back to back just before easter
this is a strong blow on western civilization
god is great allahu akbar
muslims are saying god is greatest o allah pour your anger on the enemies of islam which is more and more and burn them with the will of allah something joyful i called god to burn france because of the looting of the gas of algeria for free will burn all god willing oh god more than these fires in france oh traitors my lord avenge you yaaklab 's agents and you have taken refuge in the infidels and you have not suffered from our brothers in palestine
praise be to allah they burned and god willing the studio is burning
🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼 long live palestine this should give u guys an idea look it up yourselves
some losses make way for better things to replace them
the value and importance of the whole building does not come close to that of even one of the women who were tortured and burned to death so let 's keep this in perspective
that said i hope all in proximity are safe and sound
calm down steph it 's only an old historical building
a tragedy is if people were burnt alive in the building cathedral
the greed negligence of catholic church for decades has led to this catastrophe a loss of cultural history that far exceeds just the catholic church

wow trump didn ’ t do this stop blaming everything on him and help these people out wow
adam smith 's wealth of nations is not the authoritative intellectual foundation for neoconservative tax policy which irwin stelzer supposes now they even want to tax the humble blackberry comment october 17
book five 's principles require not simplistic proportionate taxation but progressive taxation
smith stated it is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense not only in proportion to their revenue but something more than in that proportion because a tax on the luxuries and vanities of life which occasion the principal expense of the rich would in general fall heaviest upon the rich
welcome to climate change
very nice herricane in usa

lmao
it ’ s trumps fault the economy is doing good and people are using their cars electricity taking vacations and buying boats
also it was much hotter millions of years ago than it is now
what people really should be worried about is another ice age
the damage is serious and dang it news media y'all need some safety standard i know it looks cool but maybe having an experienced older gentleman giving report should not be standing in 130-160 mph winds
when do we see the massive free stuff and help from puerto rico like we gave them
get a laugh
donnie was to busy at his funtime rally with his trumpsters
