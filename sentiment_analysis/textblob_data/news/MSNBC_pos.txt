let bernie duke it out with trump and may the best man for the country win
half truths joe if you are going to quote trump give the full quote
the reason is that to win he has to take the bully pulpit from trump
i do n't care whether its bernie or biden heck better yet maybe we should put them both inüòÄ..they say 2 heads are better than 1-dum trump üòÇüòÇüòÇ
they all need to stand down make sure bernie2020 beats trump
trump made humongous tax cuts for the super-rich and now plans to pay for it by taking the money from social security and medicare
trump will easily defeat joe
i 'll be voting trump thanks
they attack biden because they fear him the most he poses the greatest threat to trump 's presidency
if you want a chance for president stay away from talking about guns trump and distance yourself from hillary and obama stand on your own two feet not the backs of others
trump is always finding new ways to throw a tantrum
me ‚Äú so trump if you ‚Äô re giving yourself the option of doing it faster or doing the the wall over a longer period of time and that you really didn ‚Äô t need to declare a national emergency then there really is no emergency
gee is this the first time trump actually told the truth
if by any chance any chance trump is reelected in 2020 does n't seem likely but neither did his win in 2016 so who knows and the american people does n't counter that win with a full on revolution you are lost
now we need to hear from giuliani so he can sink trump right to the bottom
trump knows more about technology than anybody
i didn ‚Äô t need to do this but i ‚Äô d rather do it much faster ‚Äù melania trump
2019 is off to a good start bye bye trump
trump lawyers be like ‚Äú yeah he said he didn ‚Äô t have to declare the national emergency but that ‚Äô s not what he really meant ‚Äù
has anyone ever considered that trump might have found a loophole to get certain contractors he has used to receive government funding to do the
trump is really borat
instead of something significantly immediately pressing trump might think of this as a continual ongoing crisis evaluated in annual accumulated terms to persistently keep resolutely moving ahead regardless of opposition and obstructions
what trump was doing there with that cadence is called up talking and was very popular in the 1980 's in san fernando valley in ca otherwise being popularized by valley girls
so it 's a national emergency but trump did n't need to act quickly
what 's trump 's true agenda ü§îfor those billions or for that wall ‚õëü§êüò±üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
i have to say that from an outsider 's view president trump is a walking disaster for your constitution and is viewed as a joke by most nations in the world
and despite the stupidity of trump he 'll win in 2020 by saying he is against abortion
trump is so far out of his depth it is simply staggering
trump is looked upon as someone undermining world peace and order more then vladimir putin by all of our allies that have stood side by side with america for the past century
the supreme court rewrote the ban to pass and he claims a win typical baby trump
wow trump is reaaaally desperate to win back ann coulter with this stunt
trump has sucked the media in again and has changed the narrative from the real national emergency
if trump really wants the wall why does n't he put a 1 billion down payment for the wall
if this is how trump misappropriated funds from his own empire what makes others think that he would not apply the same method to americans hard earned tax dollars
how many lawsuits does trump face now
president trump should have the wall built then fine the people who do n't like it 800 each
why does trump sound like a 6-year-old giving santa his wish list
is trump trying to talk like an seo expert to get more hits
trump was able to manipulate and excersise his narcissism in his private life but will not be tolerated much longer on the grander scale as president
white house staff should resign en bloc since they are unable to stop trump from for acting above the law and constitution with his latest executive order
trump will win
good job trump we ‚Äô re behind you
long live trump
this is the first time i 've witnessed trump screw up and i give him a pass
the bill does nothing to stop trump from using his presidential powers under a national emergency declaration to appropriate money by himself from the defense budget this money can be spent anywhere potus desires
completely getting around restrictions.president trump can build walls elsewhere for the next 7 months when bill expires and then return to build the walls in restricted areas after the stipulations expire
if it is not an emergency then why did democrats give 1.3 billion for a not-emergency wall more money than trump knows what to do with for other border stuff
it would appear that democrats just do n't want to 'fund trump 's campaign promise knowing that a wall of any kind would work and make democrats look like liars
interesting that trumpster rhymes with dumpster must be some of those good people trump alludes to for sure
i blame donald j trump and steve bannon for the atmosphere that fosters this kind of madness
just days ago trump doubled down on his very fine people comment relative to the charlottesville disgrace
trump said he ‚Äô s a fine person
thanks trump
is this what trump meant by make america great again
the one responsible is trump cause he gets on twitter and start ranting and telling his brainless followers that everyone is the enemy of the people but yet there 's no consequences for him right smfh wake up people this wo n't be the last time this happens this is why trump needs to be taken off the office
we need to stop trump 's 'very fine people
i 'm sure president trump will be blamed for this shooting
it was another white trump supporter that wants the wall
god bless all this good people and please god take trump with you
breaking news trump rally is very huge in wisconsin
trump must apologize for and denounce his statement that there were fine people on both sides in charlottesville because it emboldens white supremacists and neo nazis
the guy is confused he calls himself a christian and that jesus christ inspired him to do it many quotes from bible he hates anti-white trump etc etc
must be one of those fine people trump was telling us about
maybe he was made that the jews did n't give trump the best property in the new settlement they named after donnie
i wonder when those young white guys from charlotville are going to protest trump
white trump supporter means trump wont be tweeting or mentioning this latest domestic-terror act
i 'm going out on a limb and say that trump is going to say that there were fine people on both sides
i have 18 grand that if he voted it was for trump
i bet trump fly 's all the way out there just because of one dad jew
sadly many commenters use this to offer pretend trump quotes to blame him
i am sure msnbc and rachel maddog will try to blame this on trump and then tie it to the russia investigation
i 'm surprised msnbc has n't said that trump was spotted running from the building
hey msnbc why are n't you streaming president trump 's roundtable on economic reform
msnbc fire engulfs notre dame cathedral trump responsible
trump i hope the hunchback got out ok
did trump passed on his mobile golden throne throwing scottowell rolls
you sound like trump
because donald trump said global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese for economic gain
how dare anyone equivocate with donald trump a true and genuine stable genius
wow trump declares a state of emergency
wow trump didn ‚Äô t do this stop blaming everything on him and help these people out wow
