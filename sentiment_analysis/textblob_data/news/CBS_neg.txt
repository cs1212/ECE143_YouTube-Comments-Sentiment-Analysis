-----------------------------------------------------------------------
trump thinks a veto proof majority in both houses is a national emergency

so mad trump keeps winning
why does trump breath soo loud..🤔🤔
donald trump 's give up on that wall this is unnecessary
mr trump 's remarks are not based in fact
trump just submitted a national emergency declaration saying he 's changing the national anthem from the star-spangled banner to pink floyd 's we do n't need no education
since trump has already previously declared opioids a national emergency should n't that already give him the power to build a wall to stop the opioids
ha ha ha trump hit pelosi over her empty head and snatched her purse
thank you trump for sticking up for these victimised women and children who have become victims in trafficking
americans are so tired of this anti-president trump anti-american rhetoric
let trump have 8 billion that is a small price to pay for the next democrat president to declare climate change and gun violence as national emergencies
built the wall so we can trump 2020
trump stopped the illuminati and saved the world keep him going and use your brain
i ca n't wait to see the bundys face off with federal marshalls sent by trump to enforce the governmet taking of a republican rancher 's land
rather be wrong and go down with trump then the status quo of the last 30 years or so
we are going backwards under trump
why when i hover the cursor over the video 's play bar do i see trump talking but when i click it all i get is these cnn jackasses
thank you president donald trump
trump is a national disaster
why ca n't trump discuss that he 'll put up a wall and enforce ports of entry around the wall
i believe in a democratic process and want to see trump succeed as he won the election but he seems to not know what he is doing
this kinda broke me when it comes to trump and i 'm an optimist
trump is a beast
president trump has the duty to protect our border and perhap uses the budget and personnel of the army
trump is a danger to national security
bravo trump
i have never seen such stupidity we do need a wall trump is right
trump 36:44
that 's what us sane americans want trump tha g.o.a.t
trump blows a bone spur
democrats would use a state of emergency to gather guns if they wanted to regardless of what republicans do or what trump does
cbs news needs to also report other truths instead of continuing with the hate trump media
1:18:10 trump is an embarrasment dude cant back up his made up numbers
i guess to trump this is negotiation
this way technically trump is not lying by signing
apparently some republican politicians convinced trump that another partial shut-down would be incredibly stupid
watch the trump administration try to get approval from various congressional committees to change how funding has been allocated to various federal departments agencies and programs
thank god for trump
nobody can take place president donald trump in 2020 election
can someone verify for me that shinzou abe actually recommended trump for a nobel peace prize
this is our wall not trump wall
nah dictator crybaby trump
trump is a man made disaster
trump hijacks other peoples pain and suffering to legitimize his bogus money schemes and political showboating
after trump agreed less than 24hrs later he flips
❤🇺🇸president donald trump forever 🇺🇸❤
the people that dont support trump just dont want to support his wall hence its bias
trump lost his fight for funding
i am watching this and i ca n't understand how anyone could not agree with trump 's common sense
the national emergency is the russian mole planted in the white house named donald trump
trump steals from the poor to give to the rich
go trump
go trump
why does trump keep saying the the trade agreements will bring in a ton of money to the treasury
rolls eye at this cheeto wow he is a sad man..how can you tell when trump is lying
support donald trump
thumbs up 👍👍👍 if you want to see trump and his administration go down like joffery from gameofthrones
go president trump
trump is a racist and a bafoon
trump for president 2020
we ca n't have trump in 2020
it is evident they hate trump but you 'll see in 2020 america loves president trump
god bless america and god bless trump
trump is the ultimate liar
😁😁😁 keeping promises trump 2020
since republican 's have failed to do there job 's of oversight and have let trump stomp all over the constitution and our laws
trump may not be likable but this blind and irrational hate is tearing we the people apart
god bless president trump no politician ever has ever fought against washington for the american people like him
trump had no choice
i say go for it trump
trump says ‘ i didn ’ t need to do this ’ while declaring national emergency
trump talked about a wall while campaigning his base grasped the concept of a physical barrier
while trump waste wall money and pocket his wallet from it the next democrat president is going to order a destruction of the trump wall
way to go trump

Synagogue shooting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
it 's no coincidence as to why we 've seen a rise in violent attacks from white supremacist groups since trump announced he was running for president
trump has been the motivating factor of it all
trump has been inciting and encouraging violence and hatred amongst his cult followers since his campaign
trump said this in front of a crowd of his cultists after a protester was removed from one of his rallies
trump said this in reference mercutio southall jr who was ejected from a trump rally
the video footage showed trump supporters jostling kicking and punching southall
it even prompted the fox friends hosts to question the violence from trump 's cultists
trump said this during a rally in st louis as protesters were being escorted out by security
trump became frustrated that it was taking so long to escort the protesters out
trump said this at a rally in cedar rapids iowa
god bless our president donald trump
the only way to demolish the terrorists is to get the terrorist-in-chief trump out of the white house
those words should be getting screamed in trump 's ears 24x7
god bless president trump
trump is anti-christ
check this man 's narrative the time sequence his exposure in the media to his meeting of another liar donald trump at the white house in d.c
so i guess a bunch of morons are going to blame trump for this one too the world is an evil place there 's no getting around it
meanwhile trump refuses to denounce white supremacy/groups
secondly he loves trump and trump loves the heebz

Royal Baby
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
i wonder how many stupid liberals that tell us every day that trump 's a dictator even though there 's not even a single solitary shred of evidence that that is true are sitting here rejoicing the birth of a royal son to one day rule over the people of england it 's so pathetic

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
wow just when trump been president everything went gone wrong 😟😩
according to trump if the french just raked their cathedrals the fire could have been averted
empty trump towers deserve this treatment not the notre dame
but somehow donald trump will be blamed
donald trump came out singin billy joel
now the trump cathedral is the tallest in paris

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hurricane michael
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
they had to blame trump lie about his approval rating
maybe trump should bomb this place now to make up the deficiency

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
trump could never hold a candle the acting president or as a man
trump is cyrus we need him now
11:40 trump with arms folded shows he 's against the words spoken an what they mean
i ca n't help but notice donald trump sat through this eulogy and other times during the service with his arms crossed and with a quizzical look or perhaps something else on his face
even trump with his arms folded near the end of the eulogy and looking uncomfortable could n't have missed the irony in the contrast of their lives
but for trump it is too late
trump 2020
trump is the least qualified in that room and theres a dead man in there also
trump crossed his arms
are you listen trump i hope you learn something for those mans
trump is like can i tweet
trump understand 18 of it and the rest did n't matter to him
trump folded his arms after the remark of showing empathy he knew it was a message to him
i hope this can show trump some character
i ca n't believe that someday trump will get one of these i hope he was listening to the part about character and pedigree
thank god for president trump
