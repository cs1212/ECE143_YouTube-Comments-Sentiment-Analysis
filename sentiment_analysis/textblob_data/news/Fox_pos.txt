Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2020 is going to be hilarious
smells hair such a pretty girl president trump is going to clown this dude
good luck with that perv
excellent
thank you joe splitting the democratic vote more and more
lol creepy biden had 8 years with corrupted obama what did he do for the working people nothing but he will this time i call b.s
biden is so in his own bubble
that he thinks his farts are clean air
2 biden just loves the old political tradition of kissing children so much that he has taken it to a new level
blah blah blah who really cares at this point
wow what a party
old out of touch geezers and clueless freshmen
they make it so easy for trump
lol 😂
it will be fun to watch him struggle to keep his hands to himself
this is gon na be great watching the new class of socialists attack this clown
dems are eating each other 😄 love it
lovely
every time a dim ocrat throws their hat in it just reveals how screwed up the party is
mothers please keep your kids as far from this event as possible
old uncle joe the notorious fondler will be 80 years old on inauguration day
hes announcing that hes gon na announce his presidential bid on wednesday lol
all of his appearances will have free pictures with him children only
hahahaha this guy
get a good whiff you guys this is what posturing smells like
joe biden campaign slogan i have a magic wand ohhhh yes i do
watch your kids old joe is coming open borders to get more kids in for him and his democrat friends
baaaawwwwhaaaaahaaaaa 😂🤣😂😂🤣😂 good luck biden all your filth is going to come it out 😁
'end of my presidency trump reacts to special counsel appointment
this does n't smell right to me
joe biden/pete buttplug 2020 lol
he would be older on his first day than reagan was on his last day
great next thing some mormon will want to run for president
trump train 2020 lol ai n't no stopping it 🇺🇸🚂
have to put schools on soft lockdown when he 's in your community
gooood luck with that lol
that 's just adorable
good old handsy biden
lol a puppet for the rothchild
good comment larry
right on
the old house in scranton pennsylvania
it amaes me that no 1 and no 2 are even older than trump
really the democrats just still keep running old retreads
if he becomes president he will most likely decriminalize sexual harassment
biden wants to be the paedophile and chief freak
welcome to the fray creepy uncle joe
he wants to start fixing problems now
what good did obama/biden do in 8 long years
haaaa haa haaaa heee oh oh haheeeeoooooh whuuuuu huho too funny gon na luv watching obozos but boy get reemed by the don..oh lord
it wo n't go any better than the first time he ran
just great another pediphile candidate
his creepiness aside i dont think he will win
too much inevitablility and the guy has that voice the one where someone is talking at you but you both know its not what he 's really thinking
do we really need an old molester in chief
biden 's song hey there little red riding hood you sure are looking good your everything the bog bad wolf could want😂😂😂😂😂😂 jumpy joe ugh
i am so excited that will seal the win in 2020 for trump
that 's just wonderful if we elect him we 'll be getting a pervert in washington with power he could even be a pedophile for all i know
trump will win 2020
i guess that we will find out if leftists really believe that 'the future is female or not
right after rupaul announces that she 's gon na run hurry up you dont want to be at the end of the line..lol
lol
great
good luck joe
makes sense right
smh trying to win a presidency by using his dead son
winning
i always have been a republican and conservative but i will vote biden proudly but if trump runs against anyone else but biden i will vote trump again biden will be a great president i feel deep in his heart he is a republican as well hahhaa
biden will run and win
he wants to bring the country closer together
ok
why is fox disabled the comments on more and more videos
joe ca n't win
funny i remember a whole lot of people saying that about trump the traitor
the democratic party is going to eat itself on air live and in color biden vs sanders on a debate stage will be a repeat of clinton vs sanders
lmfao creepy uncle joe is never getting elected lol
the libs love sexual predictors
he ll probably win due to voter fraud that went into high gear 3 seconds after trump won
doa thanks to infighting and lack of humility among the party
ladies and gentlemen i 'm going to be honest with you barry you might have a shot because all the obama supporters are going to think of that 's going to be obama 's turn and they might just vote for him
if all the little girls he felt up vote for him he 's a shoo-in
this is going to be good
thank you trump for making entertainment great again
i bet his campaign will be touching
biden is his own worst campaign slogan because he has clearly gone alone with the white males are the devil narrative that all the leftists race-baiters love to hear
the way the dems are acting no dem will win in 2020
trump will win re-election i 'm sorry trump haters but he will
appropriate his audience is a bunch of dems on strike demanding raises and benefits they haven ’ t earned
if he wins biden will have to be watched carefully during the annual easter festivities at the white house
you are becoming more like ap news every day
lol biden is the best candidate they have laughable
bidan makes fun of touching children
never had a real job
lol why
too old
he believes that he is better than all the citizens of this country
otherwise your aiding and abetting the real criminals
not to mention that he comes across as a doddering old fool
i 've been waiting for creepy uncle joe 's announcement trump 's already raised more money than him and bernie sanders combined might as well just reelect our president get it over with now if it 's the best the democratic party can offer 😀
oh boy first we had a womanizer bill clinton in the white house now if biden wins the president election he 's going to have 13rd years to 16th years old girls in the white house and the democrats especially peloshit and chunky are going to say he 's just showing them the w.h.around..patriotic 2020
leftists john mccain was too old and too white
with trump expected to win easily
boo hooing and the wailing of how could he win will not be enough to
more news
is this a joke who in their right mind would run against trump not even a complete idiot would run when they are sure to lose but joe is beyond that he is an epic loser
joe biden may win the democratic nomination but he will not defeat donald trump in the 2020 presidential election
that does it for old man barney sanders
if you support this guy you support priest touching kids as well
come sit on uncle joe 's lap
many more vigilante groups from sacramento ca have left together and are in rout to socal to help boarder patrol stop the flow of migrants at gunpoint as it is need for the next couple days then will rotate out people who have only a short time to be down there and are looking for more help as you read
so many clowns
only one reason he would subject him self to the abuse lol 😂 cry foul if he ’ s on the “ q list of 82000 “
creepy joe has 2 chances of winning and that is slim to none lol
and then on top of that he makes a joke and mockery of the completely legitimate and documented groping of women and children that he does all the time
he really trying to say when i become president i will declare being a pedophile normal and it will be legalized
creepy pervy uncle joe does n't stand a chance lol this is going to be so much fun oh president trump is going to rip him to shreds
no one is enthusiastic about joe biden
cool i 'm loving it
from free college tuition to free 1000 per month
biden is a known paedophile they can joke about it but this is nothing to joke about their are a lot of people who paedophiles have destroyed their life people like biden try to think this is normal it 's far from being normal i would n't want someone like biden as president of the united states
wow
trump won ’ t even need to bring up all the pictures and videos of biden molesting young girls and children that are all over the internet
clearly he 's mocking and making fun of harrassed women
more people throughout the country have more dignity and actually matter now because of that than ever before
he 's articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy

you do n't wait until you think it is safe you run for the country to be better if you are waiting to be safe you might as well stay home

Wall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

have a great day
my left ear enjoyed this national emergency
everyone press the quality to 360p for you can be able to watch it like so everybody can see it
when you could care less about politics and you just love to see the wars in the comment section
far left activists ca n't get it up because of post trump derangement syndrome
knock knock any real republicans out there anymore
finally a president to secure america
youtube employees lol
amazing speech totally off the cuff and direct to the american people
love my president
i put it on 360p and sound is coming out on only one ear yay
boi i hope philip defranco will cover not being able to watch this except on 360p on monday
ok i set it to 360p and the video now works
this country did n't need another politician it needed a true leader and businessman finally that 's what we have in president trump
my left ear enjoyed this video
click the three dots on the top right corner
it ’ s still high quality
i love you donald trump
now declare a national emergency on cnn the world will be a better place without their lies
trump 2020 keep america great 🇺🇸
360p do it now go back up on the right up corner settings ok
trump my man love this guy
just gets better and better keep it up
seems to be fine here
wtf lol only my left earbud has sound
d
dammm i see all the complaints of not being able to watch the vid and i 2 can watch hmmm agenda 21
trump greatest president of all time
thanks for not playing 🤣
protecting the strong weak and clueless
the wall just got 10 feet higher
lalalala the simpson is better 🤣
our greatest president
better than my idea of building a bulletin board
yeah sure fox this 35 ” wall is a national crisis mkay bud
mine plays just fine
glad to see a president doing what they said they would but boy does he like to remind you of his accomplishments
he ’ s a good president for infrastructure
fox is happy now
clicked on the video suddenly experienced connection interruption
too much wall i ca n't see the video °_°
as an immigrant from india and one who has voted both democrat and republican trump is the best person in the present times to lead usa contrast him against the clinton crooks george see daddy i attacked iraq w bush or slick obama who promised that he would control costs by going line by line in the budget whatever happened to that promise hope and change we got nailed by his gang of chicago thieves and bullies
may god bless him and may the white suburban americans see the light and vote for him this be their last chance to hold onto the values of the country that made this country great
lmao why can ’ t i watch it gives me an error
what a savage lol
haha
my left ear enjoyed this
our money not going directly to the wall
need more ice sweeps in every town in us
the ad loads no problem but the video itself ca n't unless it 's at 360p good job youtube
great job mr president
happy to see he did it but honestly do n't think it will work in the end
imagine that the president working/fighting to secure our home and the home of future legal assimilating immigrants
safety first people
otherwise there 's nowhere for people to live securely or freedom seeking people to flee to
no wonder they do n't want free speech around here
all im going to say is it best not be coming from my taxes
brendon o'connell you guys need to watch his latest video
i love him so much
you are able to watch but only at 360 video quality
this guy is pure comedy gold lmao
most honest up front patriot president ever
politics has become a great source of entertainment
how about trimming the first 19 minutes of wait time
lol 69 baby momma trending 19 over trump lol
thots out here winning
sit down lol everyone there in kindergarten class
i am willing to be it is a bug in the program that controls buffering
this might be a good place to look for ingredients
gee thanks for working as great as always youtube
i just want my tax returns lol
i like how he still going to put up the wall after no one care that much any more it bitterly a dread meme
he a savage i love it trump 2020
trump and fox new yikes
mr president if obama got the nobel peace prize you do n't need it its all watered down your better then that
haha
your friendly reminder that this senile rambling old man has the nuclear codes
what an absolute unit
he stood up their for nearly an hour
big love from the uk
thank you president trump for putting the usa citizens first
if a nation is n't secure none of it 's citizens are either
i would love to see that meeting on monday morning
we finally got a trending video on a hot topic and people can only watch it in 360p res
it wasn ’ t working at first but i put it in vr mode and then exited it and then set quality to 360 while ad was playing and it worked lol
ayeeee 5000th dislike haha
wait if it was a national emergency wouldn ’ t it be spotted at the very moment
good
last night pelosi was grinning from ear to ear good morning nancy
the real reason to smile is here
be proud
the real national emergency is how congress is attacking america 's 1st amendment rights on israel 's behalf
i ca n't wait to see the left have a hissy fit now
the best part about trump derangement syndrome is watching the meltdowns
i 'm glad youtube pays their engineers so much since they build such a quality website
the only emergency is in between old dumbo 's ears
because having an eyesore is important
thank you president trump for declare national emergency to keep us safe build the wall
thanks to the youtube commenters who told me to set it to 360p
decent people do n't go for this radical thinking
there are too many patriots who will fight this
real men and real women who love this country
change it to 360p right when the video starts to load
the right is trending
the next president is going to have a lot more power
my left earbud enjoyed this
this says there 's already 247k views yet nobody is able to get it to even start
fast and furious was because of obama
and fast and furious
yes most definitely we would like our wall built with our tax money this is our national priority before you send our billions of tax for aid to 3rd world nations as it will protect lives and the health of our legal immigrants and citizens of this great blessed beautiful nation
they still doin this wtf lmao
creative way of censorship
because youtube wants a thumbs down for this content
this is what we call free speech i geuss nice one youtube
wow what a breath of fresh air
this dude is so real
youtube being biased at its best
ok and a national emergency means what
trump 's own big mouth on national tv just helped the upcoming court case against him
guess you should start to get ur news from cnn hahahaha
lol does everyone hear that noise outside all those liberal tears pouring from the sky 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
trump 2020 keep america great
not available sounds about right youtube thanks
the top democrats and some republicans benefit from the drug cartels to oppose the wall
democrats are doing absolutely nothing about border security its time someone steps up and does something for the american people and trump is the one that is not afraid of them trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
go to quality and change to 360 you will be able to view this speech
trump should do a national emergency to put free wi-fi everywhere
the 360p method works for me now but initially when the video was uploaded not streamed i could not watch it at all it was completely unavailable for every device i had
still looks clear on 360p
he is making our boarders safe and people are fighting it
their hatred for the president is stronger than their love for their neighbors
i support my president because i love my country and care about people
biased much youtube
the real emergency is to take care of the school shootings
this video works better than a wall would
lol had to set 360p to watch low quality president give low quality speech shown from low quality news network
lol its a national emergency but i do n't really have to do it
i use many stats
yeah because making america even more in debt is an amazing idea
build it nice and high
trump shows it more each day that he is an independent citizen who wants the best for our country
he could be making more by not being president but chooses instead to help our country during the last few years of his life
thank you very much sir president
good build two walls
why is the right channel audio basically dead
we love you
he may build the wall sure but the next person who comes after him will tear it down
youtube ad plays on mobile but not video lol what
you ’ re welcome
does anyone care that none of his claims are true
lol
we all are in real danger
i like how before he was president he would want to bomb north korea and here he says “ i have a good relationship with north korea ”
400,000 got caught last year alone how many do you think actually made it in
and most of them just work here and send their income to their family in their home country anyways so it 's a double hit to our economy
plus it 's a slap in the face to people who try to come here legally follow the law and wait in line to be vetted
we have our own homeless people and veterans to take care of here first
a wall is n't the do all end all solution but at least it 's a start in the right direction
trump haters are ignorant cause at least he 's doing something about it and is actually trying to make america great again
i 'm sure illegals can dig under a wall but it sure as hell will prevent a caravan and it will also make it much harder for them especially if the wall was see through cause you could see them coming from miles away
infared cameras could pick them out easily before they even got to the wall
and it helps boarder security agents do their job more efficiently
my dad is a legal immigrant and my best friend is a legal immigrant
i love u so much trump 💋💋💋💋💋🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
i immediately switched over to msnbc and they had their panel of experts ready to explode
they are in the midst of losing their s**t and tonight will be interesting on all the talk shows and msm this all will be interesting
great president stiil great country bcz of him
if you met a guy like him anywhere else you would not be able to stand him
lol
got the view tho roll in that sweet advertisement money 💰
is n't he rich or something
how are republicans not mad
imagine putting all that wall money into renovating and rebuilding america 's crumbling infrastructure a real national emergency
that would make america great again
the commies at youtube have made sure of that
the wall is for more than you know
sounds like this man wants to put prison walls around the nation to keep the slaves of america safe
my left ear is enjoying this a lot more than my right
youtube isnt blocking the video lol
he should have asked nancy first
funny how trump does n't talk about manafort looking at 19-24 years in prison
no other president has kept his word
i always support build a wall to secure our border with no care who build it
we are with you mr president now clean out the doj of the criminal obama cronies and prosecute the real criminals
that ’ s my president maga 2020 keep america great
am i right
potus said our coffers are overflowing with money we have so much we do not know what to do with it
thank you best usa president ever
doesnt actually say anything of truth during the whole video
if there is a sea of vipers it is a pretend one of trump 's own creation
it 's a classic sting
as you ca n't see them i 'll have to let you know when they 're gone probably right after you hand over the money
ok everyone now please notice the difference in the reactions from the democrats and media from when president obama declared his 10 national emergencies
they try to cut trump down in their imagination it just doesnt work lol
if you look at the youtube numbers for this televised speech across abc cbs cnn and the rest of them foxnews was crushing everyone
😭😂😂😂 it 's emergency i will use usa money the dollar not paso for you or you it 's making america great again 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i see it just fine
maybe go out of youtube completely and try to come back in from scratch
i 've yet to have any republican point out exactly where any new wall has been built
there are many issues that need to be realized yet we argue amongst ourselves over information that we cant even truly validate
i just want the truth so i can vote for the ones i feel will bring true change so we can stop running in circles
the world continues to laugh at us pence got pissed on out there as fat donny is handling this national emergency on his golf course
give him more big macs so he expires already
everyone 's complaining about not being able to watch the video and i 'm here complaining about the sound outta the right ear
winning 😎
it will free up 8 billion
i am so proud to have a non politician as my president to represent all americans in a positive way
😡 got to be a new strategy
this video error things have been happening a lot on yt this is n't new or a political thing that some say
ok now it works
funny how the video it 's a right wing and is n't playing
the best person for the job at the most needed time in our history
you people manipulate more than teenagers on drugs
i love lamp
thank you my president do what you think is right for this great nation maga
what we need even more is immigration reform and cut off all immigration from third world countries
wow
trump our modern day george washington
o wow hes been in office how long lol all he ever talks about is this wall lol
declare national emergency on people withour adequate housing jobs and the spread of hiv and gun violence and police brutality and flint michigan water problem
wow
i ca n't stand people for real
i remember the day he was elected so many people were excited and happy change was coming
i blame the media people are easily persuaded
best of luck mr president i hope things work out in your favor sir and thank you for fighting for us all even the ungrateful ones
i loved that guy on the apprentice but that 's not who he is
there is no excuse for not facing the truth
real emergency should be declared to purge the communists out of our government
my grandpa live at mexico and im sure some of the people in the u.s live there
this madarfocker wasting billions for satisfying his manifest
we do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic to bear true faith and allegiance to the president of the united states
i watched this video 4 hours ago it worked fine
now the sound is removed
all other videos the sound works fine
i think you need a samsung smart fridge to watch the video guys it works for me
oh dang this video is n't available just like trumps wall
he is like all american republicans very articulate
mr tremendous 100
im right
growth all he has to say like u ai n't lien thru ya teeth n shut down wen right
you really can not watch the video at 720qhd
trump is the best
hahaha trump continue doing what you do
the whacky left have risen to far left extremism
a left that kills babies after they are born and wants to keep u.s borders open and unprotected and keep crime and drugs and human trafficking alive and well in the usa
i live texas close to the border
that ’ s really messed up
more important issues going on in this country than a wall
the media is always pissed at trump because he actually has the balls to do something right for once
we are very fortunate that this man this american is in the oval office
this was one of his better speaking engagements
he addresses genuine issues in a strong but respectful manner and i think anyone listening can see that this is the first honorable representative of and employee to the american people since regan and kennedy
nice try youpooop
this is are country gods country not illegal immigrants country
there was better options smh
the president is brilliant and also those who help and support the president there some dems try to on this matter
in heaven and the new jerusalem there 's a 4 walls and 3 gates on each side how much here on earth read the book of revelation 21
we love our neighbors but they need to come legally the same thing in heaven you need to be born again the people of god to get into the heaven through precious name of lord and savior jesus christ
great leader
trump is good with words he knows a lot of words lol
wow youtube nice placing a need to impeach and before a fox news video
but i agree that we do need more border security
i 'd like to know when president trump is going to start calling pelosi and schumer and the rest of the demon-cratic party exactly what they are communists
lol what a child
ok so everyone one is arguing so here is something we should try to agree on
who 's orange and is very interesting but has good intentions is trying to do the right thing and who does a good job at putting america first
trump walked into congress and out finessed the dems then walked into the rose garden and out finessed the press
good people of the united states you will get your wall
yeah donald trump thanks for killing us trying to stop making these videos if you do n't like you just understand👿👈😂
good for you
with less illegals getting into the u.s due to a barrier i wonder if higher education will let me go for free to maintain their headcount
it 's called winning and making america great again
why does he sound kinda different in this video
every other video plays just fine this video seems to be throttled
this is a natural emergency hummm ok if you say so i ges
get back our remains the remains of our great heroes from the korean war
we got back our hostages but we hope we 'll be as equally successful
donald trump wants to bring slavery back no wonder
why he saids to make america great again
bill better do a great job one month in and without results or at least a hit of them trump should fire his ass and appoint jeanine pirro
how can someone say so many words but make no sense
december 2018 i will gladly shut down the government to get a wall
i love this president
there were nearly 467,000 apprehensions at the u.s.-mexico border in 2018 the most for any calendar year since at least 2012 from a pew research center analysis of the most recent available data from u.s customs and border protection
so much for mexico paying
just like trump ca n't do anything right
it 's funny that this video from fox news is the most watched most liked than any other news network video
but it 's the hardest to watch ca n't be full screen no theater mode only in 360 quality even though it has a 720 version and not available on smart phone
it 's so popular that even you tube is having problems playing to the vast audience
i love president donald j trump
just remember president trump is currently setting the bar for what republicans are willing to accept from a president
if trump wants supporters make pewdiepie a national emergency
if you dont t series will win
4 more years trump 2020
democrats and the corrupt liberal msm are truly the enemy of the people hopefully barr will hold them accountable for the incredible damage they have done to this country finish that wall
another case of youtube censoring right wing video posts
repubs must not allow pres obama to subvert the constitution of the us for his own benefit because he is unable to negotiate w congress
awesome
thank you jesus our lord and savior for this wonderful man who is our president and is trying to protect us and all of you who want our country to be open to anyone who wants to defile it be damned
your a great american
thanks mr president you “ make construction companies billionaire again “
a slab of concrete is not going to stop anyone from crossing over
really youtube
i 'm not saying a wall is or is n't a good idea or the solution
i will say this though once my sister got relocated to laredo texas for work from our peaceful midwestern home we grew up in and i heard she witnessed cartel-related violence regularly etc etc it really hit home with me about this far-away problem that admittedly was n't something i took seriously beforehand
it really hit home with me
trump does what he says except on health care tax break for middle class the big beautiful concrete wall korea building their nuclear inventory and taxpayers not mexico paying for fencing tired of winning
glad it ’ s finally getting done so everyone can see how little it solves
national emergency is that flint still does n't have clean water our planet is dying rich are getting tax cuts mass shootings almost everyday but yeah let 's blame the illegals
president trump is so very right
so whatever numbers the media pretends to have are absolutely incomplete and inaccurate
28:16 every country does n't have a physical wall barrier tho right
ppl will just get more creative or do what other ppl be doing anyhow ex
atleast they did something good for the america before they die make them build the wall
his speech is better when you ca n't hear it
woww pretty much over half the people who wanted to watch this video including me cant even
i promise you this is not the first time this has happened on a pro right wing video
i am an elder.dragon n the web but irl i think its time for a new wall not on the fact of ileagals but on the fact that the old one has sunk into the.ground and will create a big sinkhole border wall or border sinkhole i take u ur pick
trump is a great man the media is a joke
clean that swamp and it ’ s a big one
great video if only i could watch it though
best hour of my life thank you trump can ’ t wait to vote for you again
lol
youtube is in violation of free speech and is shutting up conservative voices and this coming from a lefty
that is one smart man
my concern is all this drama about mcabe and all the rest why so much drama around it now just take care of business its what we know all ready smoke screen for something else that is brewing
shock em too never land get thier attention then reel it in and sneak something in thats tamer and more palatable with the same goals along with free air time and distraction of real intentions
problem is american people are becoming wise to it
it is a nice feeling to see
the president of our county working for the citizens of our country the house was won with what pelosi said one million ilegal votes and the house is working for the law breakers not the legal citizens it is as if the socialist dems are working for the cartel and thumbing there noses at all the real citizens of this republic in a war as this the dems have not a leg to stand on and the battle is lost before it begins the citiizens will win and they will win big 2020 is coming fast and all the outlaw dems have is the law breakers that have no legal right to walk on our soil it is a recipe for losing
youtube is trying to deplatform this video because the overwhelming support doesnt fit their political narrative
lets see how high we can build
at least if it 's up it will take them a while to take it down..or maby you should put up a monument then you could charge people to get in then build a wall or do the mount rush more thing in october and tell the kids do n't go over there cause there are faces on the rocks and that they are watching us haha
good after the wall is built kick the entire democratic party and supporters out the country
make sure you have a lot of leftovers but not so much that it 'll be obvious youre making gioboche pronounced gj-okx
use some water to help thin out the crumbled food and make it look even more appetizing
you might be able to make it an even more delicious meal
maybe the most authentic looking gioboche you can make easily and quickly is to combine three simple elements into a ziplock bag quickly
good candidates include clam chowder beef stew pea soup or other fairly chunky soups that will look like gioboche ingredients
the mixture should be mostly water
if you add too much oatmeal it 's going to look like oatmeal
if you want to go really fancy with your gioboche you can do some planning ahead of time
wait several days until it 's ready and gets mature
chocolate and strawberry look best
before it 's ready you might want to add just a little macaroni and other stuff just so you can add even more later
make sure it 's safe in a container because you do n't want to spill it somewhere and have an expensive mess on your hands
if your gioboche is discovered before you get it ready to reveal it on the altar just play it off like it 's a ante-gioboche or a gliff
youtube is blocking this video on the phone to avoid from me watching it 's number four on trending lol
i prophesy over you mr president you shall win and defeat all opposition they will serve you in the mighty name of jesus
the all mighty hand of god and all his army are supporting you.amen
love my country hate what this present government has become
everyone supporting him still is definitely racist
i ’ m sure the government is probably behind this
this man might be the best president since the 1st republican president lincoln
do n't worry we always win in the end
no one wants the president to be able to spend billions on construction projects because he wants it
i guarantee none of his top nsa advisors encouraged him to do this
drug cartels don ’ t give two shits about a wall it won ’ t even be much more than a speed bump
as republicans are we willing to go along with democrats if they get a reality show host as president who wants to do something on a whim
as long as my tax money doesn ’ t go to libtards i ’ m cool with it
better immigration and asylum laws would be far more useful
trump has as of now lost not a single thing to.the rattled pelosi if you study it she has been on the losing side of every thing for.2 years now and still.running
people in michigan still don ’ t have clean water trump what ’ s up
we don ’ t need a national emergency just to build a wall that ’ s gon na barely help
so instead of just accepting this news he declares a national emergency to give a run around so he can secure funding for the wall using military funding for upcoming projects such as housing schools gyms etc 3.6 billion to be exact on top of 600 million from a treasury department forfeiture fund and 2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and such
so it seems like trump is doing this not for the good of the united states but because he said he was going to i guess to prove a point
six more years of greatness
amazing deal maker
ending chain migration and the lottery systems is proof conservatives are just lying about wanting legal immigrants and a big door
great 👍🏼 what ’ s wrong with my phone
the purpose and their agenda will be the same and we the people do n't really have a saying in that
third temple of course children trafficking and yes it 's a big con game trump is a big part of that as well and he is a great actor at it
latest news sarah sanders was interviewed by the special council and was given a polygraph test
apparently the unit exploded and took out the power grid in new york
lets be clear
the money that he 's diverting from funds allocated for military are not just construction funds designated to build new bases and housing
national guard members activated for active service in certain 'programs are at risk of losing their jobs
aside from that most of the national guard active programs that are being affected assist in interdicting drugs from the swb ironic
the funds that are designated for the military that trump is planning on taking some of are mostly coming from federal funds that are meant for to fund and pay some national guardsmen who are working in a full time capacity meaning they will lose their jobs
between trump and congress their has to be a better way to address this
if he builds a wall the coyotes and drug cartels will make more money crossing people and drugs
gosh i thought my internet is off thanks to the comment i now know that it ’ s the video and not my internet
cool
we don ’ t need the wall because we already we have one that works it would be cheaper to increase the budget of border security and to reform the immigration system because it does not correctly show our values as americans having those two things would help the us in a great way
ok mr trump our president i was a democrat all my life as a voter
when younger in puerto rico and in the bronx during fort apache fox st simpson as a child i know what latinos are about not all like in many other rscist my family from generation to generation and even now we have a nephew in the army and one in the marines air force we also have officials police detectives my uncle valles guarded the governor luis marin munoz as a precedent in p.r
there government does n't educate they allow rapes then cuomo wants to eliminate more jails
there will be more crimes jail breaks due to over crowding
linda your latina yes but from n.y educated to be a drug counselor yes i knew big time dealers when young later on i worked with them task probation
i became s republican i own my home i pay taxes y grandkids are honor students i voted for you becuase not as a politician but a business man you know what this country needs and hoe to get it
making promises that for years have not come true
” israel ’ s wall is 99.9 effective they tell me ” yeah it 's also 100 condemned by most human rights codes so yeah
he really hates cnn lol 😂
for instance if you go to the governments website and look at the statistics that are generated by their own data collection the percentage of non-citizens compared to citizens that are incarcerated is extremely low
another of the many many lies they use to pass laws that have nothing to do with protecting us and everything to do with them taking more control
thank you president trump for fighting to secure our border democrats who oppose securing our border are committing treason and should be charged and tried for treason
he has made a joker of himself along with the family members to make america great again
just look at her daughter who has given up modeling and design and with her knowledge and experience is working as the top advisor to mr president
praying jesus christ jesus show yourself mighty to your people lord there seems to be no way out no way to fix things no ways of solution but jesus you are the solution you are the truth you are the love and forgiveness you are the author and finisher of all great things

this is called the great falling away
that nation shall rise against nation and there shall be an increase of natural disasters such as earth quakes and tsunami 's
i am not surprised at the great disrespect people show toward our president
we are seeing a great increase in these scriptures being fulfilled
i believe god placed president donald trump as our president as he was not afraid to stand up to not only those in high places in washington d.c but those in the world too
most important thing we can all do is believe in and on the the lord jesus christ as our lord and savior
make the right decision while there is still time.😇
president trump just wants people to respect this country again
fox news has gone full communist
i hope trump told commo of new york to shove it on the tax thing do n't give baby killers any breaks now amazon backed out of there that 's great
ha this donald trump guy is pretty funny
how anyone can not love trump is a mystery to me
he really is the greatest president and cares for his nation
hahaha libtards are losing their minds over this
it 's so fantastic to watch
ok imagine that a criminal indictment moves forward on our wonderful president trumpy
can you imagine for a moment when the psychiatrist first meets trump to assess his mental status
lol
honest america thanks you my president
the problem is the criminals in uniforms and in high positions that are paid to turn their eyes and shut their mouths
according to the u.s census commission illegal immigrants commit far more crime then u.s born citizens
anyone with a brain can understand this sense they do n't have documents and ca n't legally work here
many will find other means in order to financially support themselves
really trump is saying it 's already started but that just repair to the existing wall
if trump was smart he would have had an appeal ready to be heard in a favorable federal court system we know the demonrats will go to the ninth circuit if trump beat then to the punch and got a ruling in his favor at a real appeals court things would not be hindered
building a wall is a weak move in an effort to make america great again
this is the real problem
focus on real problems not harp over things that you think will get you re-elected
the only real issue is pewdiepie close to losing t-series
i ca n't believe i watched the whole thing
hippies are always preaching that you ca n't love someone else without first loving yourself
we ca n't take care of other countries if we do n't first take care of ours
man you phonies are really butting your heads into a brick wall
just think when the democrats voted to fund the wall msm had no stats to question but now that the president wants it they want to quibble about stats
my bear say softly i would like to see our civilian airliners go supersonic
how about you greedy idolatrous so-called churches pastors go and teach god 's commandment to your congregations how to honour and respect your authorities for they are his servants and practice most powerful gift you received sow your seed
we fight wars 6000 miles away wars that we never should have been in but we do n't secure our borders
he could have been a great president
thanks and have a great day 👍
wow
catch and release should only be for safely releasing harmless small fish
very grateful for having president trump
well what 's funny is it does n't really matter how many guards you put there wall does n't matter what you build a wall and i am going to get 10 million off this substance or thing here 's 2 million to just be hush-hush about it oh no it was so hard to get past your border granted they 're not doing it now because we do n't have the wall and it 's easier to just run stuff over here without having to do that you know like dig under the wall or whatever you do to get over here illegally there 's nothing we can do about it building a wall will just help our economy and you need to put the military there so they ca n't be bribed but let people who are willing to work come here and work or people who are willing to make their own companies our way the usa way for your kids build the wall any questions reply
support thanks
here 's just some of the stats that msm ca n't seem to find illegals crossing into new mexico per the albuquerque journal 12/6 161 aliens 12/19 257 aliens and 239 aliens 2/5 247 aliens and just this week already 2/11 330 aliens and 311 aliens
and here is another bite out of the taxpayers money the new dem governor is going to ditch the requirements for medicaid copays in a state where over 25 of the population is on welfare
i 'm not condoning but i 'm almost sure he knows more than we do so maybe we do need this wall
he acts like the only way drugs get into the country is by running across the boarder with them😂 the us is the heaviest user of cocaine and it 's clearly getting to the us in hundreds of different ways
lol trump gets a topic that he doesn ’ t want to talk about he makes the reporters be quiet
good for him keeping his promise of keeping us safe
donald trump wants to be re-elected he should do wath george w bush did
go report something worthy of your job titles
good thing he did this on day one like promised
national emergency lol the real national emergency is to impeach you out of office mr trump
i do n't get why so many people ca n't wrap their heads around how trump won the election
most kids today between 18-25 ca n't even name the three branches of government
trump is the best president of america
he really cares for america and it 's people
lucky country
directly opposing the constitution that has held our country together for over two centuries
his own wife does n't like him touching her that 's how bad he really is
for get the fact that every terrorist attack takes away more americans rights and give more guns to to people enforcing that fact
he better get rid of that immigrant wife of his
42:44 is the best
nice
this is the first video i 've ever seen on youtube not work
the violence showed by families in the “ innocent and friendly ” caravan by not even just males but women and children was disgusting and really tarnishes the central american image more than a wall ever could
yes please bring up the national debt more by building that wall
as far as his oral hygiene goes i feel that a warm humid concentrated breath of air would shoot towards me as he speaks as i would most likely recoil from foul odor akin to boiled egg yolks and wet bleu cheese crumbles
noticeable dried white food debris would glisten in the corners of his lips like semi-dried yet still moist droplets of elmer 's glue spreading out from the edges of freshly pressed scrapbook images
he wants the wall so he can win reelection
you 're welcome
trump it 's going extremely well who knows what that really means
he ’ s really talking about respect 🤦🏻‍♀️ what a joke
his tactic like the great leader of germany once was you worship him
huh that ’ s funny i can watch any other video but when i click on this one maybe it ’ s a coincidence
i feel like we have bigger problems right now like mass shootings so much that it ’ s not even a surprising on the news anymore we are just hoping it ’ s not a loved one that was targeted
europe japan and korea are willing to be the u.s ’ s pets only because they fear the u.s trump as well as a lot of other u.s politicians is good at making the u.s look like a victim while they are actually pointing guns at the rest of the world and forcing them to comply with whatever unfair rules the u.s places
baby trump wants his monument to racism and he wants it now
it 's clear that pres
that being said i hope he wins
the nobel prize really does n't mean much anymore after all they gave one to obama for what
it ’ s about damm time now deport all illegals and put americans first
call me a conspiracy theorist but google/youtube is clearly suppressing this video
i don ’ t agree spending this much money on a wall
youtube ’ s liberal staff set this video to 360p to prevent people from watching so it will quickly be moved off of the trending page

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Synagogue shooting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
get ready for another push to take the guns
it ’ s fine the dems will still let this guy vote 🗳
if it were a white christian male they would have his name facebook history the ever popular manifesto and all the info back to when he was 6 years old
when they give no information at all we know what 's really going on
we need armed people in our places of worship to protect the innocent
president trump is one hundred percent right if in that shooting was an armed good guy the bad guy would not be able to do the attack
california has the most gun restrictions in the country
let 's blame omar that pos is probably happy
keep it up liberals very soon every man woman and child will be armed
always respond in kind
i guess ca residents are n't all freedoms loving hippies like gov
i see more ffs ds arrests must be taking place
🤔 california should rush to disarm the next victims to be consistent of course which i ’ m confident they will
liberals asking more gun control
i live in poway i ’ ve been here for ten years
my first thought about this shooting wasn ’ t “ how can we stop these guns
the shooter was n't very good
still think mk ultra is too far fetched
a perfect breeding ground for violence drugs and theft
with or without guns good people are helpless and defenseless
make worshipping safe again
this tragedy should make the vile leftists very happy
the anti-semites that are flooding across the border are n't very nice are they
do n't sound too smart
california needs stricter gun control laws gun free zones and more immigration
like new zealand some guy did something
they are early this year
clearly this is the work of russians
wow
the gun free sign did n't work
this could not happen because california has gun free zones once you see the sign you ca n't get past the sign with a gun
it took a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun
and where in california the largest gun free zone in our country
some person did something in a gun free zone gun free state
the media will give this far more attention then it ever gave to the 380 easter worshippers that died in siri lanka
there will be more if the laws are not changed now
wow the synagogue of satan is catching hell lately
this event is happening very close to the border
it 's okay it 's california they have open arms to criminals policy
california has the most gun restrictions in the country how could they let this happen
keep inviting the devil in california this is far from over
fox has really dropped in the gutter these last 3 or 4 months
trump said there are very fine people on both sides
well being in california they can not say it ’ s from not having tough gun laws california is one of the hardest place to own a gun
the law enforcement police secret services ice border patrol doing great job and they are working tirelessly
breddy sure this is a honk honk.jpg
droning on about the same event when there are many others going on
you know that sometimes on the darkest of days there ’ s always a silver lining and a rainbow 🌈 around every corner and always find it and sometimes should be glad these aren ’ t times like the holocaust or world war
this is what you are supporting
madman absolute madness
many saw that it was a ploy all along
he needs a good jewish lawyer
you could have gotten the same information from me and i do n't even live in california
he has the right to remain silent no matter if being investigated or not
california they will use it skew it politicize it misrepresent it then forget it god love that state
good and in a sanctuary state too
the blame lies directly on the anti semetic rants of the democrat paty
lies lies and more lies unreal
shooters name confirmed as samir el hydid
so much for your gun control lol hows that working out for ya
i live there
the end of time is near
californians should demand the right to carry
where the good guy with guns
when someone says sounds like a black male lol

whole kalifornia is a 'soft target
there were good people on both sides
innocent people go to prison too
i wonder what peaceful religion he belongs to🤔
must have been a gun free zone
why would kamala harris want a person like this to have the right to vote
hahaha yeah right okay 👌 😉
i do n't worry i 'm actually doing something right
the trump administration must put economic sanctions to the liberal left media ’ s that promoting anti-semitic articles
as usual they will get away with it but now its come home to roost on their own doorstep
be on the ready at all times
this is direct effects to lies and counter acts to american values
ban the guns or ban the some people why should i lose my rights they win
how in the world did someone in california legally have an ar-15
oy gevalt 600million never again etc hahaha
taken alive
sigh another young white privileged male being disillusioned with life
this is complete chaos
never believe everything you hear without fact checking first that ’ s something msm doesn ’ t do anymore
can we lay this at the feet of certain democrats who 's anti-semitic rhetoric encourages these kinds of acts
hmmmmmm gun free zone
who he live
🤦🏼‍♀️ it would be nice to fully understand what is being said and now have to pull out the 3st handbook on what he ’ s saying
another gun crime in a supposed to be gun free zone
why do i still live in this state
obama deported more in
since general sam houston
we are still relevant
bernie would give him the right to vote
way to much supposition opinion this is not news but gossip
we better step up and stop this violence we are the only ones
america will not be a safe place again until synagogues are safe
he must be magic
and not trump 's fault you even more hateful libs
most of those reporters do n't even know where they are
there will be more shootings because of politics religion and ignorant terriosts that are here
they have a whole bunch of gun control
heck the shooter ca n't have mags with more than what 5 rounds
it was a gun free zone in california
at least it makes for unforgettable passover.😨
interesting how these mass shootings happen in states with substantial gun control legislation and/or in gun free zones
i hope the victims of this tragedy survive and the shooter is punished at the greatest extent as justified by law
if the guy was hispanic people would be screaming “ build the walll ” in the comments for sure
just proves liberalism equals nazism liberalism equals socialism liberal equals repression and war why are our brainwashed youth being indoctrinated into communism at our vile and treasonous universities and public schools
who wants to bet that he is not a white man with full support for nra and trump
he is one of the very fine peopletrump always referred to
hold my beer this fine people are out in full
first
unprepared passive and naivety is becoming common
a bunch of democrats out shooting as many people as possible and then blaming the gun laws and the republicans
i hope president trump knows about this from the news and do something about it and fast bc i would n't be surprised if they try and turn this all around to blame the one man they despise most our potus that 's how deranged currupt they are something else to try and pin onto the president once again
i fear this vile violence will continue and it is why citizens should have the right to defend themselves
for those who are confident be vigilant and please get some training to defend yourself martial arts
report who the person was as you would normally do
maybe prison for a couple of years and probably have better care then when they lived out of prison then out they are again to do crime all over again
prayers are for more good people with guns to put an end to this senseless violence and make these dirtbags think twice before they act
police custody is too good for someone who does somthing like this
we ban guns from good citizens why aren ’ t the bad people listening to us
and i 'm sure that no one will call it what it is which is domestic terrorism
california is a gun free zone and they have more mass shootings than texas and texas has a third of all the guns in america
its like they do n't care or want to understand they would rather give up their freedom to protect themselves to be stoned all day and eat at del taco and allow harm to fall apon innocent lives
no sorrow for the innocent shot by another crazy guy with easy access to guns
yes we blame the nra and the administration that puts votes ahead of innocent people 's safety
impressive how quickly donald trump has been able to gather so many new russian alliance nazi 's around him
19 year old white male
an ff right after trump 's gun speech
most people wish this crappy state would fall into the ocean
this proves gun free zones don ’ t work they get more mass shootings then anywhere in the world
why so many dislikes n a shooting in america nothing new
okay like real americans are just going to sit back too much longer with bs
y'all shoot any more reporters
wow why didn ’ t their gun laws stop the shooter
let me get my pop corn ready
gun laws are nothing but lip service to the public while it simply undermines the good peoples right to self defense while the criminals will always act with malicious intent and have a gun even though the laws are prohibited certain makes and models
we need to not have less restrictions on the second amendment to ensure that the good citizens of america can protect them selves
guns will never go away they have been around for centuries and will be around for generations more
i pray for the jewish community and i hope california evolves their gun laws rather then dissolve their citizens right to bare arms and defend themselves
as u can see this a terristic attack at christianity and jewish religions this whole year
they create the conflict and then they apply the new laws
that 's a gun free zone
probably a religion of peace member carrying on more terrorism
i ’ m sure a gun got out of its cage and floated around shooting people
is cnn reporting that the guy lives in the white house and is hitlers great grandson
was it one of trump 's very fine people
good
he is a hatemongering demagogue pure and simple
welcome to trump 's america were yet another white nationalist goes on another murderous killing spree
in the philippines they have armed security in most stores and malls hotels
more of trump 's very fine people in action
all 2 billion christians are responsible for this isolated incident
we have an “ assault ” weapons ban high capacity magazine ban and a 10 day waiting period
tell me how more gun laws will keep people safe
i thought everyone here was a good christian republican
thanks trump lol
another nra success story

Royal Baby

other news around the world mothers of low birth also giving birth to new babies
another tax payer funded golden pacifier
i 'm so proud of myself for being so woke where is my scholarship and cookie
we the people had better realise that a new sort of overlord has captured our nation and has subverted our constitution
facts point to our former overlords the good old uk the crown corporation
boys are better than girls
harry could have done so much better than megan
he deserves better as well
first congrats to new royal parents

hope the natural mother is well
great

his true father was a polo player that diana was seeing
now not only is he married to a woman of black ancestry but he 's also just had a baby with her
good job diana
meghan markle and prince harry welcome first child whom they 're going to make a transgender and raise gender neutral/fluid

so glad all went well
there 's an old idiom if you ca n't say something nice say nothing at all that continues to be good manners in today 's world
plus this is about a new baby created by god
we were all created by god and his 2nd greatest command is that we are to love one another
okay uhhh his not our prince we live in united states
thats a happy english man their secret haters was praying for a girl because a girl would not get any title at all
i 'm sure the baby is very interesting looking
she is pure trash
lighten up be happy for other people 's blessings
my friend 's daughter just had a beautiful baby girl
he looks more nervous than excited
•harry and meghan overruling the queen and royal traditions which is frowned upon and very rarely done
conservatives are supposed to be the good guys but just as dirty as the left here🙄

all the best wishes
wow can they really say that

enjoy your baby boy and raise him to be a good person and not a spoiled rich kid
it must be nice to do 1week of community service then spend the rest of your life hikeing taxes our democratic socialist runners are learning well it 's campaigning time
i bet they sacrificed their real first child to bal and this one is born from a diffrent woman in its place
finely
first royal niblet
we should n't be celebrating another of satan 's spawn being born to them we should be celebrating a successful cruise missile attack on their castle
these comments are the reason so many people call the right racist
like most babies i 'm sure it 's so ugly it 's cute
i hope parenthood and family life brings happiness to them
omgawsh its always the orbital accuracy right to the crown of competency and correctly communicated content in valid solicited context more radiant and effectively exquisite with each hour etc
anyways one might get the impression that the prince is not a fan of the tabloid trash press all the time and that he might punish them if it were more appropriate
it does n't matter that the democrats are destroying the country after all this is what 's important after all
every life is a precious gift from god
can you you just be pleased and stop with all the negatively
if you ca n't be happy for new life then just be quite
with her dominant gene of black skin color there 's a great chance will be light black skin baby in the buckingham palace
latest baby has got indian features
i wish them and their family all the best
everyone has deep respect for the queen who has done an outstanding job over the years
nine months passed already that means she was pregnant months before they announced she was pregnant congratulations to the parents ca n't wait to see it this should be interesting
it is going to be excellent
the main stream is so out of touch they actually think people care about spoiled silver spooners
now that the installation of mm into the royal family the installation of the clinton nwo agent into the palace and the installation of the baby from the natural m_us_lim birth mother is complete we know that mm 's handlers are very pleased with themselves
now they will re-organize the mm preggy pictures timeline by the size of the bump for the sake of history and buy beautiful prayer rugs for every domicile
i am glad she is ok but i don ’ t care
a son wow
glad to see that at least three people in england are happy and living well..mulato privilege
as soon as interest in meghans pregnancy reaches zero in the uk and bookies stop taking bets on it suprise suprise meghan gives birth to a child who is outside the top 6 in line to be king media interest in uk is who cares its just a minor royal who will never become king
they live lavish lives off of ppl taxes
china is the real threat anyway
a healthy fresh lizard reptile a boy
lol
why is this baby being celebrated at all is n't he male white and just a little bit privileged
surely he should redistribute his inherited wealth evenly throughout the those without a voice population
how much you wan na bet she will raise it as a girl
thrilled and congratulations from across the pond
play nice

Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
quick to declare it an accident right before easter
tragically a burned out and destroyed notre dame is a perfect metaphor for the france of today
they must have some amazing forensic investigators in france
do n't worry they 'll build a nice mosque in place of it
i am not a catholic but notre dam to me was a true historical work of art
and a real loss
ask some real questions
i honestly feel like someone could ’ ve done this
“ the fire started up near the roof top while another fire started in the north bell tower
if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in them
very suspicious on holy week for all christian 's
france once a major influence in the world will downplay any wrongdoing
so many more people than just those who are religious will mourn the loss of this incredibly beautiful and loved cathedral
it wasn ’ t an accident from the renovation when you do any kind of work that might start a fire in a place like that you would need a permit it was most likely terrorism i wounded if anybody is taking credit for it
hopfully the building will be ok and the people fighting the fire.😔
if this was arson we will never know the french government will make sure of that
there should have been many more precautions taken
see channel the outer light mystery figure on notre dame rooftop before fire
well there goes my 10 happiness and 4 faith
tragedies are becoming common almost every 2-3 days or even weeks
funny how come 4 days before this so call accident things were removed from the top of the cathedral
how come they did not use the water right there on hand
this is very suspicious
the cross stands a tall an amazing picture out of the ashes we are reborn to continue our fight our struggle
perhaps now is the time in the midst of this tragedy that we must remember more than ever notre dame is not burning
i really really wanted to see the notre dame cathedral
prayers to all the people of paris who lost one of their natural treasures
well as sad as it is there 's a lesson in all this appreciate what you got today cause some day that shits gon na be gone lol
maybe its the right year to visit that ancient thing you 've been wanting to see for ages
this had 2 of my favorite things fire and old buildings sadly here they are together gon na miss it
wow
what a shame hope they rebuild this beautiful structure
either this is the result of complete ineptitude or deliberate action
really
catholic church old as time burns
wonder if it has to do with a certain influx of migrants in france
i hope i am pretty sure that this building is documented sufficiently so it can be reconstructed
i 'm glad i got it to see it in 1996
everything in there was older than my great great grandmother
i was with my mom and when we received the news and we overhead a little boy ask his grandmother if quasimodo was still in the cathedral and if he would still be okay
hopefully they can save this beautiful cathedral
i hope quasimodo made it out safely
for the time has come for judgment begin at the house of god and if it begins with us first what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of god 1peter 4:17 cp ezekiel 9:6
the full armor of god
10finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
11put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
12for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
13wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god
fox news is now the new cnn
wow those circular front windows with the smoke coming out looked like a freaking skull
i don ’ t really know tell me what u think
honestly if they did update it and included electricity then it could of just been an electrical fire bc those spread very quickly especially in older buildings
i hope most of the building and its art works could be saved
ninja deployed c4 when no one was looking you can see in his europe vlog lmao
heartbreaking loss of priceless art and architecture
im pretty sure most major world events are planned
that took all the people of paris 350years or more to build
i love when tragedy strikes
i really hope nobody was hurt when it fell
the apocalypse is near stock up on ammo
you just ca n't trust the french with nice things pity
of course they quickly say that terrorism likely is not the cause
amazing how a stone castle cathedral can survive for 800 years and then all the sudden get destroyed buy accidental fire wake up people
hahaha
france strong 💪 the most important thing is that there are no human casualties
there no way easy get on flame
let more mosselims in
tourist should have used their brain and move away so the fire fighters could have contained the fire but their stupidity is enormous and because of it this beautiful gothic antic is very very damaged
i loved it a lot😭
i was the 4000th like lol
now everything is gone😔 i 'm so blessed i got the chance to see this beauty 💘 stay strong paris
suddenly this near 900 year old church is burned down
i was lucky enough to visit notre dame and when i enter the cathedral the organ was playing
it was absolutely beautiful and gives me chills to this day
is the hunch back ok
as a person who loves history this is sad to see i ’ m just happy that they are gon na be able to rebuild it won ’ t be like it was but better then it not being at all
but is quasimodo ok
this has been done many times with other historical buildings
thankfully most of the structure is still standing
it will be fun if it turned out to be a pack of winstons
an epic and historic loss
another french monumental structure will surely rise up from the ashes demonstrating french resolve once again
can france do anything right besides make wine
this is a cultural tragedy for not only christians but for history itself
though i am not catholic and i am not french i am glad i did visit this place during my army days
i wonder if someone started it on purpose and you know what kind of people that would do this
good morning， francestan
oh that ca n't be good
thats sad my prayers are going out today for the people who have in one way or another be touched by this beautiful building the true meaning will of what it stood for will always be in your hearts..blessings of love from above praying for all involved to be safe as they deal with this tragedy 🙌
it 's very suspicious right before easter
people are getting fired that 's for sure
lol
think about it why is this getting more media coverage
it really is a tragedy that such a beautiful building has met such a tragic fate
the loss of world civilization it ’ s okay people are fine
that ’ s the most important thing that counts
my condolences to every french and every catholic christians in the world a great loss indeed for the people of the book
saddens the heart loved going to the gregorian chants on sunday mornings during my stay in paris
had the most epic stain glass window like an enormous jewel
no fire system in such an important place
i hope it will be repaired quickly but it will never be the same
there should ’ ve been modern fire sprinklers installed years ago
our top priority now is to put france flag filter on our profile picks
scientifically most effective counter to terrorism
where is my boy quasimodo gon na live
800 years old withstood the napoleonic wars two world wars and several city sackings and then to be taken out during a renovation
yeah i know it is not the us im just very upset to lose such an icon of western culture
i hope quasimodo is ok
nuuuuuuuu the important monument d
pay your debits or get real insurance i recommend loyds of london
rest in piece a legendary structure
i was lucky enough to be able to go there a few years ago
“ we don ’ t know what caused the fire but we ’ re certain is is not terrorism ” hmmm sounds like a huge contradiction here
went there last year hope everyone is safe
the fact that i learned so much about notre dame just this year in french class breaks my heart even more
helicopters with water bags and the river right there would of got this fire out much faster
good serves them right for nuke tests in polynesia paradise
i 'm so happy
they sure allowed that thing to burn long enough
the whole dame thing is burning
is it just me who thinks that 's a little cheap for such a historical building
you neglected to mention macron 's original comments that hinted at a mosque being built on the site
those comments have been removed from the internet and replaced with a a more general comment about the rebuilding
what a moment to be alive
i think it should be restored to the original design not the design just before the fire
hopefully fast finish
i 'm just really upset that such a beautiful and historic building is being destroyed
tragedy it was so beautiful
cersei has taken it too far this time
oh my god i had really wanted to see this too..😰 it 's gone now
it is true if its such an important landmark why not have some kind of fire protection in place as standard
the building was made 1000 yours ago and if they rebuild it it won ’ t be the same it will just be a new church
this is a 'check mate in some grand chess game
i ’ d be willing to be it was a “ refugee ” to set fire to it
we are very happy to see this fire accident 😀 voices from china
that 's not normal lol
over the past year many churches in france have been attacked
i wonder what caused the fire and how they let it get so far out of control
you would think a very important place like that they would have done more to stop it
another french church burnt to the ground interesting
trump could get more information from his son of law jared kushner
hope the hunch back is ok
tourists lol
when i clicked on the tv and saw all that smoke rising from notre dame my first thought was what
they picked a new pope
fox why did shep smith ask a person who witnessed the fire his opinion and then quickly cut the guy off as he was answering the question
that is anything but journalism and is a prime example of why most people think all of mainstream media is a joke
they need more children
macron can take this opportunity and replace it with a mosque for his beloved followers
right now i ’ m going to switzerland and tmr i ’ m going to paris
and from the globalists macron and secularism that is now most of paris and a lot of europe we may never know
o great news
i am soo happy 🤣
is that where macrons new house will be
fools see it as a cultural icon
that is the problem with modern men
check the locations of the hot work permits and the video cameras
it will be interesting to find out what started it
if this does n't start a new french revolution i do n't know what will
he was burned right outside notre dame
lmao reading the comments on any notre dame video on any other channel is nothing like reading the fox news comments
the absolute state of you conspiratorially minded bafoons
this is some gta kind of stuff
in my school the juniors and seniors are currently taking a huge field trip to first paris then italy
it is by the grace of god that they are kept safe
good luck humanity
jacques de molay ’ s revenge says think i ’ m the old thing that you can burn wrong again
thanks macron very cool
but heavy steal girders did in another famous structure fire
wow trump always going with respect and measure announcing our cathedral looks like it 's burning to the ground when only the roof was ablaze
real nice donald
real sensitive thank you 😒
before you reconstruct notre dame cathedral better get the mohammedans out from france otherwise you may waste your money
it 's like if i 'm rebuilding someone 's 54 chevy truck cause their great granddad bought it new.and it burns to the floor.and get him another 54 chevy.its not the same
it was so beautiful but now it got burned 😢
looks like a place for a new islamic center just opened up in the heart of paris
i know she is ok she called
i wonder if the hunchback is okay
dont be too surprised if it turns out to be isis
probably just the beginning after all many christian haters arrived in europe lately
good thing no one was hurt or died during the fire incident which is the most important part
isn ’ t this building made of concrete
kind of symbolic how the catholic church has been in free fall collapse since vatican ii and accelerating under the argentine clown real catholics lost this building a long time ago after the french revolution
nice i hope the rest of the west follows suit
there 's an old poem by william blake called the tyger
tyger tyger burning bright in the forests of the night
i am filipino and the notre dame cathedral is one of the many historical structures that i wan na visit someday
the end is nigh i 'm ready
too many coincidences
if it 's found out that a certain religion did this to this bastion of christianity in france and the government tries to cover it up it will be the last straw in an already highly fractured country
they probably could make good use
maybe they 're worried about the ecological effects of all
those hi octane gasoline engines on old airplane without smog controls
right
for the french that makes perfect sense
a lot of people are talking about it like it ’ s just to do with religion but norte dame was a beautiful building with a lot of history
it is one of the most visited monuments of france and the heart of paris it means a lot to french people in general and not just catholic ’ s
great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth
think about all the books and art in that beautiful building that is now ash
the building is a great structure but the items within are more precious imo
glad the firefighters were able to save part of the structure
it takes some real skills to save an 800 year old structure and focus on what can be saved and what ca n't while everything is burning around you
go ahead and get a lighter or a match box and try to light stones on fire and tell me what happens
that fire-destruction is evidence that somebody made a huge mistake when they constructed that building
it was supposed to be made 'strictly out of 100 pure solid stone and absolutely nothing else
really trump have heart
now it can be rebuilt as a more inclusive site for 'all the people in france
i wonder how much was it insured for
why are some people in the comments happy about this
when is construction on the new mosque starting
best news all day
too much thinking by the cardinal
can not save his own house
they will fix it the books and art work is a shame the building can be fixed
who did this i would be surprised if it was an accident
very suspicious
a lot of people refer to good 's judgement if i read those phrases i believe the schooling system in the united states is some kind of good 's judgement
i live in paris since birth and this monument is and will be in my heart forever
the world grieves over the loss of a hugely iconic and historically valuable monument
finally some good news
the 3 stooges the utmost care should have been top priority just because it was being worked on doesnt rule out arson actually it opens opportunity for arson
allah o akbar god is greatest
aww i ’ ve always wanted to travel there so sad😭
judgement day is near people
god bless you all 3
i heard there were sightings of a very suspicious looking pug dog hanging around and making racist gestures with his right paw at the time the blaze is believed to have been started
pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
just a joke don ’ t get triggered cause i know how sensitive you mfs on youtube are 🙄🙄
only 180 to 200 years ago no news would reach people of this fire for years and despite its long lived fame it is just a building the statement arsen would make is much more relevant
if only there was some sort of higher power that had the power to put it out
france the first daughter of the church
this is what happens when you have more tourists than worshippers
it is truly strange the tubing of the renovation scaffolding did not melt or collapse under the intense heat of this fire
given the fact that man has corrupted manipulated and controlled religion to control us all it ’ s not shocking a false building used for such immense deception is no longer
the elites house of cards is falling spectacularly
france needs to do a better job at taking care of its monuments
i hope leave elui is ok
no structure is worth more than the people 's voice
someone started this fire so they can force more taxes on the french people to pay for the scum who come on boats
i 'm french thanks for the support by american..a good and great new in this horrible tragedy firemen have saved the holy crown of thorns of jesus and a piece of cross but others relics sainte genevieve etc are forever lost
i really wanted to visit paris and see the beauty of it
not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but sounds kinda suspicious that the cathedral that 's managed to withstand over 800 years of harsh environments
being catholic in conjunction with the disney film visiting norte dame was something that was on the top of my bucket list
lol drump not trump
what if this is our heavenly father pleading with all good catholics to please turn away from the church and start following jesus christ
good babylon is starting to burn
this organisation has caused much pain and suffering of the saints
in all seriousness i am very sadness to hear a piece of history being destroyed
there should be a firefighter quarters near such monuments old buildings are known to catch fire
the most high judgment is upon us
they will build but i will tear down says the most high
its so beloved by catholics and non-catholics french and non-french alike
that 's real talk and you have to believe me because i said it was real talk
notre dame was so beautiful
i wanted to see it in real life but i never will
i have played civilization many times i thought world wonders were indestructible
a new mosque i take it 😒
thanks syria
wow
wow
the cunning vixen elizabeth surely revels
it 's one of paris most beloved landmarks how could this happen
one of the great wonders of the world is burning but france takes 2 hours to even try to save it

i can not believe all the sarcastic hateful comments
this makes me very depressed
i 'm french and from what i 've seen it was somehow caused by the construction work it was being renovated that was going on still unclear though it will take a few days of investigation to figure out how the fire really started but it spread quickly because most of the structure of this building is made out of wood
something this iconic does not just conveniently burst into flames
where was the fake christian god lol
somebody did n't follow the safety rules in the restoration hot work permits fire extinguisher next to a flammable material fire watchers cus everything starts with a little spark
this is the kind of thing that hapens whens you let animals from third wourld countrys in and alow them to run amuck
my first thought was did somebody cause this from smoking a cigarette
and he ’ s right
lol
lol
it is almost certainly arson but unless someone with proof leaks it the french government will never admit it because if it is arson we all know the religion of peace mongers did it
let ’ s forget about material thing and focus on what god want to be good with others and ourselves
jesus christ one of the most elegant and beautiful buildings in the world burned to rubble
if the french government allows this i will gladly donate what little cash i have to rebuild it
cool nice fire
wow
even though i have just learned about this in social studies i still loved it
catholic is a full of gays
i 'm just glad that no one got hurt and that the fire got contained
probably arson by one of those kind and thoughtfull refugees
is it just me or i can ’ t see how many likes a comment has
lol even the old buildings don ’ t want macron
very suspicious
so-called native and hispanics this is how we got to the america 's before european people came here straight from the bible
40 those are the 10 tribes which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of osea the king whom salmanasar the king of assyria led away captive and he carried them over the waters and so they came into another land
42 that they might there keep their statutes which they never kept in their own land
44 for the most high then shewed signs for them and held still the flood till they were passed over
45 for through that country there was a great way to go namely of a year and a half and the same region is called arsareth
president trump had the right idea
where were the tankers why didn ’ t someone approve dropping water from helicopters the river is right there
this would have been worth the expense
as an african if nobody died then good
in 1963 on the initiative of culture minister andré malraux and to mark the 800th anniversary of the cathedral the facade was cleaned of the centuries of soot and grime restoring it to its original off-white color
it can be used to quickly extinguish a fire
it ’ s sickening that people can joke about a very meaningful building that survived ww1 and ww2 is burning after surviving territories attacks and was able to stand 856 years and everyone is blaming it on a certain race and discriminating because of what other people did from that race
it makes no sense why people have to be spreading hate and why everyone isn ’ t spreading hope and prayers because today everyone has lost a very important place religious or not this is a time to spread peace hope and love to everyone
let them ring the bell next thing you know they 're burning the whole cathedral down
looks like macron 's refugees are adding some diversity a mosque will most likely be built on the ashes of notre dame
who they well the public sure can not afford energy weapons
your one of the major problems
fox news reporting is looking for more drama
saying compassion with over dramatization with sensational reporting is ruining everything not notre dame
i am french american to be precise
good thing the fire was caused i wanted to die in there

i ’ m just a 12 yr old girl so i have no idea
what ’ s so important that it has to be all over the news
oh it ’ s the west ’ s main religion
just a burning iconic church why would we possibly believe otherwise right
isn ’ t this kind of i don ’ t know embarrassing for france
i mean it ’ s one of the most important buildings in the whole country quite frankly whole of europe and it survived two world wars and a revolution only to be burned down because of some renovations
the french government also owned the building and partially funded the renovations so shouldn ’ t there have been more precautions in place to prevent accidents like this
i get that fire can spread quickly but they don ’ t start for no reason
that building holds so much history so many paintings from times long past
one of the stained glass windows broke and will never be able to be replaced the same way ever again because how they used to do stained glass when that window was made is now lost to us
welcome to the group
oh how fun
i 've never seen smoke rise from a large burning structure like this before with such a bright-reddish color to it such-as-this
or because of the old materials that the ancient building is made from or what
end times are near
get ready world
just a building god will be just fine he 's really not into buildings if you 're saved your the temple of the holy spirit
0:36 did he actually say president drump lol
who also wants to guess another act of terrorism
it stands proud for over 850 years and within a few of years of islamic invasion it burns down
i smell a rat and its name is macron he 's a low life for sure
if the french think this was an accident they are in more trouble than they could ever imagine
what a pleasant news ，did they think of this when they were burning the summer palace
france and the media were quick to say not arson how do they know without a thurough investigation
another old church was set on fire not long ago and we know france has taken in a lot of christian haters
the burning of notre dam is a perfect example
what better way to shut the yellow vests down and preserve the power of the establishment
so touching and beautiful
huge gold cross like a beacon still attached and on the back wall not burnt and safe
haha
do n't worry a mosque will be built in its place to calm the virtues of the citizens
i think i 'm reading it exactly right
paris is beautiful
this is a sign that we have to get much closer to our lord jesus christ
from sevilla spain 🇪🇸 to all the people and the beautiful notre dame of paris
seems tragically ironic
one week before 2 major christian celebrations and it started 15 min
religious cultural or political terrorism
who does it hurt most and who benefits most
wow i hope the hunchback made it out
chinese people send congratulatory telegram，congratulations to the french people on their success 。for the old summer palace
this is no other then the religion of peace work i guarantee you and they will not tell the public because they know this would be the last straw
do n't worry people wal-mart will build a super center in there
like right now they are building trees over all 64 pyramids on earth
so much of a loss but the enemy will be in flames soon
don ’ t worry macron will build a nice mosque there instead
hopefully everyone there was fine
there is a better chance that a mosque would be built as a replacement we are watching not only the end of an era but the end of western civilization in europe
i hope the looney left is happy
guess he cant figure out that the building is very fragile and would not be able to withstand that
remember way back in 2016 islamists were caught with a car full on explosives parked next to the cathedral
notre dame of paris is the very pinnacle of gothic architecture dating back to the 12th century pre renaissance period
many non-christians will suffer the consequences of their existence now
я из россии кек а потомучто я русский это не значит что я делающая свинья кек
whoever destroys his own culture and tradition dies
notre dame cathedral will be replaced by a mosque with huge minarets
im absolutely devastated my favorite movie is the hunchback of notre dame and because of that movie i always wanted to see the real notre dame
and it is not needed any longer as the french people are nearly all apostates
glad it burned
the church in india was burnt to the ground and now this hhhmmmm i wonder who done it let 's have a wild religion of peace guess
god is a true treasure that will last forever
i wonder who might be responsible
notre dame on fire is an appropriate symbol for the state of the western world in europe
only rich people that can afford a trip even know the place exists pay for it yourself
president drump lol
well they had to make sure all there sins were covered
i hope everyone sees this comment but you do n't have any idea how happy are the refugees in paris asking to add fuel to the cathedral and make a mosque in it 's place and many photos of them laughing in front of it burning
good may allah burn u all
hope the invading powers now know the pain of ppl in invaded countries when they destroyed their culture and heritage and looted the country of their riches karma has its own sweet story to tell it will take its own sweet time but it will give back whatever u have done in the past
make no mistake of what this really is
this is just one late event of recent years that are tied to the verse babylon is fallen god has been pouring vengence upon that idolatry catholic group but people wonder after the beast who is being slowly consumed out of his place-was palm sunday like 'sunday as they were open only for toursist not a mass service good that is was closed and all you prodies your no better than your big c brethren protestant groups are as a cage of fowls demon filled so called mega sepulare churches
they care more about art than people
funny how so many people are supposedly heartbroken by this and i bet very few are even christians
thanks drump
something is very suspicious here
godzilla has had confirmed sightings in paris
i have more sympathy for the world trade center instead
poor hunchback.he has a warm bum such a shame do hope they can rebuild it
never mind.they are already talking about rebuilding with more present day france..one that reflects what france is about now..there ya have it
i do n't know much about white culture historical buildings
maybe they will put a nice patch of green grass after the clean up
i was watching this from ze window and i was crying i could not stand to stare at this beautiful church just burn down
you really want to live in a world without europe and europeans you degenerates
see what cheap labor gets u
an edifice this iconic belongs to the whole world
it 's ok eu will pay for repair 😖
all holidaze that have absolutely nothing to do with the biblical feast days of the most high yhwh looks like the imposters are getting the rebuke from him
out of all the famous buildings in europe it just happens to be one of the most well-known and oldest symbols of christianity in the world that gets destroyed
firstly my heart goes out to all the firefighters who worked so hard and bravely to save notre dame
as far as we know right now this fire was n't arson
go back to true catholicism
yess yessssss i am happy that a church got destroyed
lol
they stole the egyptian obelisks during their occupation and so far still in paris
highly suspicious
it 's seen tremendous damage but the external structures seem safe which is 95 of what people associate with the cathedral
they 've more than likely saved the internal art and religious relics
the organ windows roof and spire are more than likely destroyed but the roof and spire are not original and were being replaced anyway
deus vult lmao
he offers firefighting advice flying water tankers as if he knows squat about the subject and as if hundreds of experts in the field were n't already involved and we now know any water from above would have destroyed more of the cathedral and its contents and then to top it off urges that they must act quickly because of course without that instruction from the all-knowing trump everyone would have dawdled as one of france 's greatest and most historic buildings burned
every day he finds a new way to humiliate our country
to my surprise one hundred stories high
it was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode
the heat was on rising to the top
everybody going strong and that is when my spark got hot

how come donald trump is the first or is always very early to always respond to such things
it is apt
likelihood of huge

would be tears of joy
good to hear that they plan to rebuild
wow god is in control
it 's amazing how hateful humans can be to each other
we 've really learned nothing being here
i 'm surprised france did n't surrender and let the fire take the whole thing down
it has such beautiful architecture and historical importance
it really is a shame
in fact he slaughtered his own people when they erected a statue in his honor when he said not to
i hope old hunchie got out ok.😢
all these people with faux tears over the destruction of a cultural landmark
most are not a part of its religion and sell out their culture to foreigners

i 'm in florida but not that area i 'm just getting some of it and were just getting some rain and a little strong wind so i 'm fine
like i said do n't mess up with mother nature because sometimes that she could bring the hurricane any month because now everything is changing right now 2018
yeah but climate change is n't real or anything right
in the time before modern science people conceived of things in supernatural terms infused into every day life
but it 's more like a goddess the personification of a wild and destructive feminine archetype much like the recent ford-kavenaugh debacle
it 's a good thing global warming ai n't real and warmer big wet ocean water does n't fuel hurricanes
living on a generator and candles fridge raider plugged in and wi-fi trying to stay safe in st petersburg florida no power whoever gets this hi everyone is on the communication i have right now
lol fake news
he is the only reason i would stop watching fox news as we do not need democrats at fox new network
the storm went from a category 2 to a category 4 as it was supercharged by abnormally warm waters in the gulf of mexico
but all good climate change is a hoax
we can barely feel it here in orlando because i went to the aquatica today across from seaworld and then the sun came out a couple times but mostly it was just cloudy
so a cat 4 hurricane and i live in florida yet somehow its made landfall and school was still open i live in the middle but cmon wth i never even know there was a hurricane coming he ’ ll my school barley mentioned it
if this hit new orleans there would no longer be a new orleans to go back to for a very long time
i don ’ t live ther but whoever does i pray that you will be safe please dont get hurt
let 's all pray that people are in the safe places that nothing can happen to them
the less frump followers the better
surprised he is n't blaming trump for the storm
the real storm is the weather machine attacking the trump supporters
congratulations i am enjoying it so much it 's really so great
yesterday i was in orlando florida for disney world and we got so much rain
luckily i am home now and safe
trillions and billions and dollars somewhere on florida and panama city that some of you that you heard that is panama city is florida right there not panama but panama city in florida do n't get confused just looking in google map anyway and one more thing this is going to be the biggest expensive money for the for the cover that people lost their homes property and business no seriously half of americans are 50 states had to surrender of the money what day are saving and then tried to expense of florida so what 's the hurricane just passed away and how much is going to be expensive that to rebuild again en florida florida that everyone florida so this is how you call recover of everything of stuff and try to expense more and one more thing the people that i 'm saving all this piggy bank to have to spend damaged property and business to florida or anywhere so this is how it goes working business okay
wow
honestly i wouldn ’ t be surprised if we get like 10 hurricanes during the winter at this point
he also seems to like his new catch phrase 'mob to describe anyone who dos not worship him
i think it 's karma that republican states are the most affected by hurricanes
it 's also ironic because they do n't believe in climate change
pulling out of international agreements does n't look too appealing now does it
for the people that live in florida and panama city please try to me cover of your stuff and everything business and small stores and even lost property right there so this is only just a message for people in florida that 's it only for the people in florida that 's it
if you do n't live in florida move on in this message is going to be the people in florida that live in the danger zone that 's it
my friend jaylen is going there with his grand mom
how many hurricanes like this went through the area in the 70 's and 80 's
lol i hope they all die
ok
omg i ’ m safe because i ’ m in cambodia
and irma roared up the west coast right through naples instead
best if they all stay in nyc safe and sound where they at least wo n't get in the way of people actually working to help deal with the storm
so happy rooftop surfing
good source for accurate level headed reports
there is other important news apart from trump dementia
this why i detest religeon you guys only judge him for being gay he tells the truth so you use his love life to degrade him
whole bunch of trump voters are getting all washed up now good
excellent news two conservatives states whacked in two weeks

Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
this is a great tribute from a son to his father
i was n't a supporter of bush 43 but this was a very nice speech about his father
well delivered and heartfelt jeb looks completely heartbroken my condolences to the bush family
trump sitting next to all the people he wants to throw in prison 😅
got ta love our potus he knows this is a bunch of bs
very touching and honoring
beautiful eulogy
a beautiful eulogy from one president to another from a son to his father 🇺🇸
by some comments i read wow
the somber tone was broken several times by stories of the late president that showed he indeed had a sense of humor and laughed and smiled
g.w
bush gave a good eulogy
i like how he used humor to show how his father enjoyed life
now that george w bush is out of office and i 'm older my personal feelings about him have changed a lot i still hate a lot of the choices he made and policy he enacted but he seems to be a warm and caring individual who does carry him self with dignity and composure like his father and watching him speak with the most heartful respect and admiration about his dad especially after losing my own this year
i get tear filled eyes and i just wanted to say that i 've developed a new sense of respect and admiration for him now
i did not have sexual relations with andy b 's dog
beautiful eulogy from 43
this week has reminded me that i can be a better man servant
wonderful eulogy president bush
beautiful tribute
what a great tribute rip mr bush 🇺🇸
a beautiful eulogy
on behalf of my family and i we really apprecificate you for being here sorry just had too
that was pretty powerful delivery from george w
absolutely heart felt from a son to his father
god has a special place in hades for this man george herbert walker bush
lol
simply beautiful mr president 43
simply beautiful
no matter what your politics are in this world you can ’ t deny how beautiful this was
gladly trade gb to get jfk back
george your father was a wonderful president of the united states of america
this guy should be glad he 's still alive after hunting fictional weapons of mass-destruction
a fine tribute
beautiful words for your father a good man
superbly well done
no father could ask for greater courage greater dignity than was shown here by a dutiful and loving son
amazing speech
you are a beautiful man w
i 'm surprised he held it until the end
if these living presidents could turn to the media in one even voice and say stop attacking one another and our beloved and blessed nation
i believe that powerful pronouncement would have an effect on all the madness in our daily life
god bless and good bye sir
i love the 43rd
the real story of george bush senior who had to deal with the globalists
history will long remember this as it does with all the great speakers
great
great speech
i love you too mr president as i did your dad reagan
for me you were the great comforter of our nation in the face of 911 a new century
you had the prettiest first lady as well
thank you george for the beautiful eulogy
i know a lot of people thought of george w as a goofball but this was an excellent eulogy
he has always had a great sense of humor
old pappy said he wanted a bigger funeral than that sumbitch mccain got
i do n't particularly fancy politicians but as a human being feeling for another human being i cried with him
that was wonderful touching and often funny
beautiful eulogy he gave about his father heart breaking to see a man lose his father and cry
he lived a long fruitful live
incredibly well spoken and well said
an incredible eulogy for an incredible man and president ❤️🙏
i enjoyed the service except for the constant camera focus on the clintons and obamas
mother always said don ’ t sit with your mouth hanging open you might catch a fly
hopefully bush jr will will be hung twice for good measure
respect watched this live in the uk very moving and emotional..well done sir..george bush jnr
sooooo many criminals under one roof
that was a very good eulogy
the best good by speech ive ever heard
your father would be very proud of you
3:15 always the consummate mouth breather
good riddance to the old gop
long live trump
and gw just made his first hole in one after golfing his whole life love him or hate him his dads watching out
thank you for much more than you could have possibly dreamed especially in relationship to president trump
respect and great speech
better america because of
i like how fox titled the video appropriately unlike cnn who went for a clickbait title and monetized the video
a great man i pray those who choose to use this time to criticize with 0 facts will find peace in their hateful lives
so much respect
dear president george bush we the american citizens are standing with you and all your wonderful family members
i know the loss of a beloved father but your holy god will never forsake you or leave you
may the love and power of the holy spirit be a constant guide and comforter to you and your entire family
best wishes from an american patriot
he did really well
thats a beautiful eulogy
i thank you mr president for all the ways you served and loved your country
i have some ideological differences but this was beautiful
love and strength grace honor
why does it take the end of someone 's life to express this love without reservation and share it with all
i hear w eulogize his dad think about my own father now in his 80s and wonder how i 'm going to get through it with the same grace and gratitude i saw today from a son who loved his dad as much as i love mine
great job mr president
beautifully done
a thousand points of light google luciferien freemasonic a thousand points of light
i was watching it live and i cried at 12:05
i had the distinct honor of serving under you while in the military
fair winds and following seas sir
omg what a wonderful eulogy
incredible eulogy mr president
your dad is proud
george hw bush would be proud of the work trump is doing bringing jobs to the working classes lifting their standards of living and delivering on republican promises
mkultra nothing more to say
good for gw
nice job
yeah knowing what poppy really did makes me really want to cry
what an amazingly beautiful eulogy
obama and trump are lucky that things like katrina 9/11 a recession and entering into a new war never happened or have not happened so far in their presidencies
they must know how to live peacefully before they preach about it
they are not even satisfied after marrying 4 wife 's beast
it 's great to see all these people together and not arguing and fighting
that was truly beautiful
would of been good timing for the military police to come in and arrest them all on live television for treason
great eulogy 43 👍👍☺👍👍
no one fits her the original shoes a 8
aww ty original
beautiful tribute to his father
good on ya george you did good dads head is held high as always 🙏👍🇱🇷
bill had his happy pills
bush jr is funny
vile creatures are in for a treat and i am not supposed to be happy about it
hope you enjoy your trinkets
bush wars killed more innocent people than any terrorist group
beautiful
it was a touching tribute yet there are so many stories of atrocities bush senior committed at least it sounds like he was a decent father
well done president bush jr i wish the best for you and your family during this tough time
12:06 the saddest most heartbreaking part of the whole eulogy
serves you right losing someone close to you after all those people you killed on 911 and in the middle east
nicely written eulogy
r.ip mr bush safe journey on behalf of millions of somali people you have save from starvation i thank you
anyone who does n't believe the bush cartel was responsible for the 911 buildings coming down are living in a fantasy world
it was still a son ’ s love for his dad
beautiful and honoring
but what a beautiful and touching eulogy
nice eulogy from jr to sr bush
beautifully done
thanks god
with love ❤ president to president or not
it 's still love
beautiful
i really am broken hearted for them they sure were close as a parent it brings tears
he was an amazing man and raised a amazing legacy a good family man may he rest in peace and thanks for your service
truly beautiful
4 god sake u r not showing the great trump
with all due respect if public service is noble than why do we have congress with no term limits
i hope our future is filled with the wisdom to treat all as individuals and to strive for the best this country could be
this is the first time that gw bush ever made me choke up during one of his speeches
you were an honorable man and a great service to our country
love your family
love your daughters
think they are hilarious
love that you had your dad 's dog attend his presidential funeral
a true testament of great character and of a family 's love
you all make the world a better place
people walk away from you feeling better about themselves
i wonder what this farewell party cost us hopefully not as as much as our so called hero mc'cain cost us these politicians have drained us taxpayers to the tune of almost 22 trillion dollars absolutely shameful but some people have no shame our politicians have broken this country to the point of no return im sure their proud of themselves
even though i didnt vote for him he did his job the best he knew how to do it
great consolation that if they were christians and we are christians we shall meet again
what a trash eulogy from a son who waged war and killed innocent people to a father who played golf and killed thousands of innocent people in irak
lmao idk why but i started laughing when i saw trump barack obama and bill clinton sitting next to each other
awesome speech
touching 😢
haha
what great eulogy from son to a father nothing negative only positive thoughts we want to hear more eulogy life stories how the person leave out his or her life what a great journey he was having
i tear 😢 up a bit cause it 's sad 😭 to loose a loved one does n't matter old or young it 's a love one rest in peace mr w h bush your journey was a great one 💔
i 'm surprised obama and clinton did n't burst into flames when they walked into the church
bush for you have run a the race set before you go to the lord so that he may say to you well done good and faithful servant.~enter into the joy of the lord
putting all political sentiment aside for a moment which i wish my fellow human beings w/hearts minds would do i have to say that eulogy was just beautiful
i love my dear father too
i know the devoted love a child has for her his father
may they all be comforted with love from friends family the lord
rest peacefully h.w
wow he did n't mention trump once
that 's how a good speech is done
i think this was a wonderful tribute from a son for his father
i 'm so happy that the bush 's requested no political agendas and that the former first family 's and the present first family showed the world that civility still can exist
very touching and heartfelt mr
great words
could you imagine how great america could be if the swamp could love america and americans again
good times before the democrats ruined everything before clinton before obama
i think george bush senior should be remembered for the president who was wise enough not to go into iraq
i know junior was his son and loved him but no one can love the evil this man did in this world
a beautiful touching eulogy with a perfect mix of portraying loving moments essentially love the cohesive invariable all throughout recognition of wonderful achievements overcoming terrible setbacks and appropriate dashes of witty humour as every spoken word or sentiment completely sincere and heartfelt
george h w bush was gifted one of the most captivating and divinely glorious deliveries by way of his loving son george w bush
this was a preponderant event of truthfulness it was the sincerest of transparent love illustrated by a son celebrating his father 's life and ascension into heaven and george w bush adjusting to this worldly life devoid of his father 's physical presence yet in prayer and strong faith all will be united owing to god 's grace mercy and eternal love
enjoy heaven george h w bush and i am sure you enjoyed the amazingly stunning celebratory funeral that rendered politics smaller than an incredibly honourable life that you fulfilled and guided and inevitably taught your family with divine strength character and wisdom and above everything unconditional supportive love
thank you and god bless you george w bush for one of the most memorable eulogies i have ever witnessed
i ’ m not a bush fan either but i was deeply deeply moved by this wonderful eulogy
i have never seen a more genuine beautiful heartwarming speech by a son to his father
most of america know this but they do not
incompetent traitors that drove america to a 20t debt but all got remarkably rich
makes me really appreciate any president and their sacrifices they make to serve our country
great story
very heartwarming eulogy
why is that all the perpetrators of 9/11 are running free and that we are still scammed
thank you soldiers for being so brave to serve others and protect us
without you we would not be free
what so many people forget and what so many take for granted
and for that you have no right to claim freedom as your right
you should be so lucky to claim freedom as a privilege
i am glad the republicans ignored the democratic party trying to bait them into making this a political show
i´´m not a fan even less but i think it was very brave speech by g bush and from a country wich 70 dont have a relegion at all i wasnt bored for a minute and i admit i now like them more even jeb
nice show but no cigar as far as i am concerned
the rituals did not work right
i know a son feels loss when his father passes away but i feel nothing for a family that would sell us out to a global agenda under a luceferian concept of 1k points of light
by the way trump is the best president we ever had
my most sincere respect to the bush family
that was so amazing
no political jabs no b.s just straight respect for 41 like him or not he was a president and first and foremost a great american
hw bush was head of the cia a criminal organization he was a liar war criminal destroyed the lives of millions and is treated like father knows best
the 41st president of these united states of america he offered much and denied some
a 'thousand points of light emanate from one single gleam
he was a decent man
the late president bush was n't perfect nor did i vote for him but he was our president and because of that i respected him and supported him
i wondered who is going to deliver the eulogy for clinton and obama and what good they are going to said about them there are going to have to invent a lot of lies
gwb always was good at spreading emotional witchcraft
anyone who thinks he just happened to be reading to a group of children when the cameras were poised in perfect position for his face when he supposedly heard the first news of the towers going down is also going to believe anything else he acts out on camera
lol
i wish a sinkhole would open up an swallow the whole bunch of murdering stinkin pigs
trump lol
george mentions how his dad “ was the brightest of a thousand points of light ” again as george h.w
2015 was the year of light and the illuminati have controlled the vatican for decades now
lucifer is the “ light bearer ” meaning we are in the age of satan
be kind to each other
every day is a precious gift from a realm much more beautiful and complex than anything you could possibly imagine
there is more to life than simple left vs right
i always liked george w 's speech with light humor
this is a great tribute to his dad
no matter where president trump goes and sits his posture has always been 'ready go
one is full of energy and another is really aging
we should never leave our children a world better than we found it
we should never leave our children with more money then we started with
i see it everyday when you have been standing in line waiting to cash out at the store and someone walks up right behind you and another line opens and they are quick to run over first instead of offering it to the person in front of them who has been standing there longer
it is in our nature to only live what we know and what we are taught
they think the most easy things in life are the hardest
they think of a right only if someone can provide it to them but think it is someone else job to provide it to another and they do not have to
handing a child everything in life only gives them moments of happiness but a lifetime attitude of entitlement
you think by giving everything your child wants as opposed to everything they need makes you a great parent
this is why schools are failing kids trying to paint a picture of a perfect world where everyone holds hands and sings songs
that person faults are truly not their own and someone should take care of them
a child has a birth right and these are few and far
to a good mother and father who is envolved with their children who loves their children and shows discipline parents today do to much or not enough but i promise you that if you give your child the right amount of love and the right amount of discipline you are teaching your child the most important less of all respect
father hood mother hood love discipline respect morals values ethics and above all god
children need to earn the simply things in life or they will never earn respect for the basic things in life and spoiled on the large things in life
mandate two years of all out of high school or 18 years of age to serve in the military
but money talks and too many people 's jobs depend on control and taking the child away
they kids that grow up with emotion problems is because they lack either a father or mother and lack the foundation of what a child needs love and discipline
living under the same roof does not mean your are parenting your child
i guess the situation is different when it 's your own family member and you demand respect from all attendees at the funeral of your own
i recall my ultimate disgust in the first iraq war when the air war laid to waste an archaic army that did n't have a chance to surrender
bill clinton look like his 10 years older than bush when their the same age btw people with negative comments really
this has been a good year brezinski died then his benefactor david rockefeller then the bastard daughter of the beast barbara bush and now ole georgie boy
may these scumbags spend the rest of eternity knowing their new world order is dying just as they have
thank you g h bush r.i.p..this went really well thank god the tariff guy was n't invited on that microphone to give a speech nobody wants to listen how he won the election
really
george w will always be my favorite president
apologies for chiming in i would love your thoughts
it is a good one off guide for learniing amazing eulogy speeches minus the normal expense
ive heard some amazing things about it and my friend sam finally got excellent results with it
these tears come from a son who bombed irak with hundred of thousands of innocent people killed
we miss you greatly
you and your dad were great presidents
5:59 d tearjerker part of this eulogy is that their 3 yr old sister died
do you believe that president bush was a good man come on fox you ’ re making too much news of bush get a grip of yourself and broadcast the real news of today like the federal reserve taken our interest money when we could print our own money and own no bank any interest why don ’ t you broadcast that i know why you won ’ t say this on tv because you ’ re scared to lose your job your network is being paid by somebody you ’ re not allowed to say certain things so you keep the public in tune with bullshit
the bush institute is doing amazing work
most people are washed out by media and have no clue how many sick and hungry this man is currently helping
you are looking at a great leader
che che jima lol godspeed 41
thank you george for honoring your dad in a loving funny and respectful way
today a lot of us said good bye to an amazing patriot
i can not put in to words the respect i have for this man i think the thing that sticks with me most is the 73 years of devoted marriage
that is commitment that only a strong love can keep
a true american hero on so many levels
such a heartfelt eulogy by a thankful and loving son
this entire service shows the importance especially as an elected official namely president to live a life of dignity honor and respect
it becomes that much easier for people to deliver genuinely kind words about you at your funeral
you may not agree with all or any of the polices of the men seated to 45 's left but they are all men of dignity and honor and all worthy of our respect because they showed respect for the office they held
that was beautiful
i guess if i had a man-wife as ugly as michelle i would sit by a beautiful woman too
i really do n't care he can go kick rocks lol
this was great ex president
george w bush is certainly the most likable war criminal
i was n't a big fan of the bush 's but this hurts so much
ghwb was a true republican i wish he was still here instead of that joke of president we have now
i respect george h.w bush sr he was highly intelligent brave
he was no coward him college was fullly paid for but voluntary to go to war
good bye poppy
america has changed not for the better
how many deaths did the two bushes cause in the middle east
could n't say it any better
saying goodbye to a great man
yeah well i lost my dad in 2016 and he was a great dad too
but somehow my dad was great without being a member of skull bones and without coordinating the hit on jfk and without giving the green light on unnecessarily killing 10 's of thousands of civilians and without partaking in numerous satanic rituals at the bohemian grove and without slapping terri hatcher 's ass in the presence of secret service agents and without foreknowledge of the events of 9-11
amazing right
trump setting there all sad knowing he will never receive this kind of ceremony
no past presidents will attend
most of the country will be glad he 's gone
he would be saying how great he was and how he supported bush in the 90s and talking about his hair
