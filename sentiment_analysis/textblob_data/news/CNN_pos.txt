Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
creepy uncle joe biden wants four more years of hair sniffing and fondling children
when your candidacy is contingent on opposing someone else instead of advocating for your own platform you 're going to lose see hillary
lol good luck with that
you know you messed up as a country when a pedophile starts running for president and it even looks good for them
it 's an exciting moment here on the set cnn your bias shows
lol ok sure
joe is running on a platform of msm hatred no suprise really yuck
demonstrations attract many people
many are innocent persons
lol joe saving us from the kkk
wow big surprise his video is nothing but pandering nonsense
thats good joe but what are you running on
a better name for this segment would have been how to platitude circle jerk 101
make groping kids great again
biden 's speech was so touching
great the democrats have a ton of great candidates and choose an old pedophile
why tf are they smiling for joe so much
moral core from the guy that extorted the president of ukraine to fire his own godson to protect biden 's son 's crimes
ok
so uncle touch too much is formally running
wonderful
james allsup made a video about his campaign and honestly thank you james
lol ü§£üòÇü§£üá∫üá∏kag2020
his platform would consist of reaching out to women voters in the most creepiest way
cnn wow biden has so much experience
also cnn wow bernie is just way too old experience does n't matter we need young people
yeah right biden is a pervert and that going to come out big time
western media god always right and can not be challenged
creepy joe biden could n't even beat his own meat let alone beat president trump
i like to grab them by the shoulders and smell them by the hair and if you re a famous politician they let you get away with it not trump
and from the great state of delaware an over the hill deep state alumni with extensive hair smelling skills the fabulous joe doe
somehow ‚Äú we need to remember who we are ‚Äù seems like an ironic slogan for an old man
8:13 the only thing biden feels is the women he s touching against their will
the video was pitch perfect
thanks for wasting my 10 minutes of my life to see the corporate democrats pick
cnn and msnbc are corporate democrats pushing this sleepy and handsy old fool
creepy joe will get devour by his own partyü§£
joe wants the antifa vote ü§°
cnn doesn ‚Äô t care promoting someone whose been accused for sexual harassment even before they start the campaign lmaao
he just wants to touch up all the kids üòÇüòÇ
easy win trump 2020
the fact that his campaign video is only uploaded on the cnn and abc channels instead of biden 's own social media truly emphasizes how deep in the pocket of corporate media and other companies he is
49 years in politics name one accomplishment grope change 2020 guy has early onset dementia too old moving on
biden major pete 2020
ive got a great campaign slogan for you for 2020
he proposed means-test cuts to medicare and social security in 2018
welcome to the race uncle joe
it ‚Äô s going to be funny watching them shoot themselves in the foot again
the fighting and crying it ‚Äô s going to be great
repeating the same mistake hillary did in 2016 focusing too much on trump rather than his own accomplishments
good night sleepy joe
if the democrats do n't hold fair representative elections again for their front runner let 's pray that history wo n't repeat itself in 2020
this is the greatest thing that could happen for 2020
go home joe sure take the train if you want just get out
so many closets so many skeletons media start your digging
i still remember biden saying a good serb is a dead serb
so what exactly is this supposed to be
lol
arllette looks really excited
good to know mr vice
lol
he finally slipped up and said something honest
this is great
actually i 'm joking but that 's what i keep hearing thanks joe we are one step closer to a civil war üòÅ
the pattern is full
sanders warren 17 more
if creepy joe wins the primary i will vote for trump
looks like neither one of them can handle real news
lol
nnaaaawww im not really into this idea of touchie feelie grandpa who might be a habitual grabber..oh shit wait i see the connection now lol
hilarious ‚Äú average joe ‚Äù
america ‚Äô s first openly proud pedophile presidential hopefull
he 's got more in common with romney than warren
great way to attract progressives
our president will bury you so like our president i am going to enjoy watching
biden will certainly get the nambla vote
main stream news lies
lol i have n't seen these talking heads smile like that since before trump won the election
how 'd that most qualified tag work out for hillary again
the dnc ‚Äô s primarily is their super bowl because they will be crushed in the general
biden you 're the great hands man
not the best america has to offer
when u got more dislikes than likes lmao
love ‚ù§Ô∏è joe
good
biden the only democrat who isnt completely insane..unfit to lead a nation
too many democratic candidates because
wow biden offers so many policies
ahhh but the difference this time with biden running for an office is he has the blueprint and personal support whether publicly seen or not of the man who did it extraordinarily well and won twice i.e
2020 is looking more and more like trump ploughing through the democraps like a bowling ball ploughing through the bowling pins
that 's a bold stance joe
the public is being denied access to about 2,000 boxes of records from joe biden ‚Äô s senate career information that spans more than three decades
the university of delaware where the biden archive is stored says the records might not be available until late 2019 possibly even later
i think trump is cute do n't you
awesome
the good thing about joe touchin is that the more he speaks the less people like him
grandpa joe go home and eat a bowl corn flakes that speach is full of lies and deceit you know it the democratic left wing goondabat satanic jack assess know it
joe has more experience than all the other nineteen candidates combined
wow
in the same speech where trump stated there are fine people on both sides re charlottesville trump said i 'm not talking about the nazi 's and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally
this is a new low because leaving out a clump of the speech removes all context
regular people on the right also turned up not knowing the klan and nazi 's were there
when he said both sides he was talking about the regular right and the left that opposed the statue
as much as i admire the former vp but i like tulsi gabbard much better as candidate b/c she is running on policies and also lays out how to pay for it all
if the democratic party and the establishment media cause bernie or any other progressive candidate to lose the primary do n't vote biden
cnn is so smiley and happy about biden
ifjoe isn ‚Äô t proposing bold progressive policies he ‚Äô s not getting my vote
we need something new
how can an old man like that be running for anything when he stops to hit on every girl in sight and the occasional young woman too
a whole lot more kiddie fiddling i bet
let him run he ‚Äô s easy to beat
so i guess were basically just making sure trump wins again and we have n't learned anything over these past few years
it must be nice be a trump supporter
seems like a perfect candidate for the dnc
why should democrats or independents looking for a better and more dignified life trust an establishment status quo candidate that republicans so gleefully desire
foreign government lobbying one of the most inexcusable swamp practices was all part of the job for joe biden when he was chair of the senate foreign relations committee
yeah that 's how to win creepy joe
loved it but he won ‚Äô t get anywhere if he take corporate pac money
the media are doing a excellent job protecting this pervert
love your work
if he become the president of the united states in 2020 then the future of america will have many homeless families many unemployed families and goverment subsidiies hahaha hahaha
trump 2020 for sure
trump we love mr trump 2020
biden will win
joe is the only vp not allowed within 200 yards of an elementary school
cnn using bots to give biden more likes lol
almost all who are running have good qualities
they have to have the leadership skills to take on senate right now they are on a mission to try and take us all back to the 1950 's not move all of us in to the future
look at happy their are lol
his campaign is based on a lie how special
biden wants to run for president again
go right ahead loser he has 50 yrs experience in losing
i 'm sure his cokehead son hunter will hook daddy joe with a few lines or so to get him jacked up for the campaign stops
wtf lol
there is still hope that most people are not being fooled
lol
cnn is looking like fox news more and more each day
one more in the clowncar
bidens platform grope as many women as possible because you cant indict the sitting president
4 more years of sexual harassment
that is what make america a light a beacon of hope
how many times have you run now
thanks for slitting the wealthy donors and the establishment vote üòâ
we do n't need more establishment bs
wow
they seem so happy about it
wow he also looks older than bernie
the president of the united states did not call nazis fine people but the exact opposite
you had many people in that group other than neo-nazis and white nationalists
now in the other group also you had some fine people but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats
going to love watching the armies of poc and women on the left go after the dems for pushing another white man as president
biden for president ahhahahahahaha lol lol ahahahahahahahah
great
all those millions of wasted campaign dollars could 've been spent more usefully
there is no doubt trump is going to win again in 2020
i only know one person excited by this news and that person is elderly wealthy and just quit the republican party everyone in the real world is voting for sanders
i love it lol go biden go
the fact that you poor excuses for a journalist are trying to make joe biden look credible as a candidate just means that you are part of the of the far left bias on the media
he ‚Äô s going to split the establishment vote by being a softcore republican awesome news for bernie
he 'll make a great pres
the first change will be an eo to make the age of concent 4 to keep himself the deep state free from indictments
its going to boil down to two candidates bernie and biden and bernie would win but he will be cheated again and then trump will dunk on fuccken biden
look at the smiles on these corporate shills lmao
not pro-biden but he sounds a lot more presidential than the orange clown currently in office
the sucking sound begins
i heard the cia will have armed guards at every polling booth to make sure no illegal aliens vote that 's the best thing for america
he offers no polices or issues to fix america
what a lot of people democrats/liberals don ‚Äô t know is if bernie wins the primary it ‚Äô s the same as giving trump the election
let ‚Äô s be very clear a vote for anyone but biden is a vote for trump
you need the rust belt to win
really
make america great again 2020
if biden win the primaries trump will will the election easily
these news people are all tingling hilarious
a vote for him is equal to four years more of trump as our president
in 2016 biden helped prevent bernie sanders from running and winning against trump
not a single one
the charlottesville police did nothing to hinder the left-wing anti-fa from assaulting the right-wing marchers or even try to shield/protest the lawful and peaceful marchers
yea i love bernie
but biden probably has a better chance of beating trump
4:55 üòÇ even cnn can ‚Äô t hype biden up interesting garbage
president biden it ‚Äô s got a nice ring to it
what a joke lol
i was ok with biden up until he accused sanders campaign of trying to slander him and its sad that one of his backers is ready to kill bernie lol smh
sure is a slap in the face of the me too movement
lol and look at this reporter
the look on her face says she is ready to follow or come along
greatnews exactly the very best choice.thank you obamatrons~trumpwins/2020
the book describes a meeting in december 2013 between hunter biden managing partner devon archer and top chinese government leaders
i live in australia
we are amazed how much trump is like the third reich in 1933
vigorous joeüë¥zionist joeüòà trump re-elected thanks to joe biden winning the primary
anybody but bernie right democratic party leadership üòâ
hillary clinton almost won maybe joe biden can almost almost win
no thanks i 'll take the guy that went to jail for being on the right side of history bernie2020
next thing we 'll hear about how many celebrity endorsements this guy has and how some iffy polls are in his favor despite what other polls say
go real progressives 2020
who here has even heard another person say i want biden to be president i hope he runs and wins
trump 's victory is certain now
reclaim the good america
biden opposed ending segregated schools then went on to burnish his rep as a good southern strategist and corporatist tool by authoring the omnibus crime bill
cnn should treat biden like trump the way they portray to be so fair and do not vote democrat
this is the best man to get america out of shame made by trump
vote for the real leader bernie 2020
trump also said that there were very fine people on both sides 339 340 and then added i 'm not talking about the neo-nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally
21st century racial tensions are now not only based on ignorance and intolerance today racial tensions are now escalating due to economic downturns and regressive tax policies
biden if i am elected i will not say nice things about nazis running people down in the street dont expect anything more from me though i have no sympathy
how many takes did it take to get together the whole little film
love ukraine kids
if biden is so great why has n't obama endorsed his run
biden said because he wants it to be on merit but i think a glowing reference from your boss of 8 years who formerly filled the position you 're applying for would be exactly the kind of merit everyone would expect
the greatest document in the world
here 's my thoughts on the dnc plan this time around with massive voter fraud like they did to bernie the dnc makes sure biden is the candidate
with even more massive voter fraud than last time they finally steal the election
tbh it 'd be much more interesting to watch a sandersvtrump election
biden is just too easy to beat
has anyone asked melania if the real dt ever left russia
why ca n't they just let bernie win this time
trump is racist and has economic polices that hurt average americans
biden wont be racist but will implement the same economic polices
biden has good chance of beating trump but the aoc wing of democrats wont let him get nomination as they want someone with a üê± üòÅ
his first act is to lie in his announcement smh
there are much more progressive candidates to pick from
the hack biden is personally responsible for thomas being a justice of the scotus
many of you were fooled by trump
if people do n't support the true front runner bernie sanders trump will get another 4 years
he is going to continue all the great things he has done for working class and minorities because he cares
lmao
whoot so excited
the sad thing is he is the best of the 20 they have running so far
and joe bloe is basically just an old klansman dressed in sheep 's clothing
good luck because you are going to need it
who is this guy talking to he 's been sniffing to much deep conditioners hair coloring shampoo hair spray flat iron smoke just for me curl activator bobbi pins relaxer creme jojoba oil cocoa butter aztec clay hair grease hot straightening comb residue and lard
thanks for reminding me i needa up my donation for sanders üëâüèæüåπ
flashback joe biden 's first presidential run in 1988 cratered amid multiple instances of plagiarism
joe biden for president and for vice president bernie sanders 2020 democrats good luck i hope win
i like the other lemmings was willing to jump all over trump until i listened to the whole tape
practically no one wants biden to become the democratic nominee let alone the next president
better yet send him a link to the press conference on youtube so he can see for himself
his ‚Äù good people on both sides of the argument ‚Äù statement at the press conference had to do with the debate in many citys across the country about whether statues in various parks should be torn down or not
surely biden didn ‚Äô t know that right
please send more women
look at how happy cnn are because their corporate darling has announced he ‚Äô s about to run
just comical
please no üò° i hate this guy
please we need new faces
lol
i watched the whole thing all morning live
but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides
you had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a park from robert e lee to another name
okay good
he was a major slave owner
it ‚Äô s fine you ‚Äô re changing history you ‚Äô re changing culture and you had people ‚Äì and i ‚Äô m not talking about the neo-nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally ‚Äì but you had many people in that group other than neo-nazis and white nationalists okay
joe is more gone than trump
even if there were n't the video issues the last thing we need in the white house after trump is an old gaffe machine
wo n't win the nomination
i will be registering every person i know who is n't registered i will do my best to get as many people as i can to the polls i will donate money even though i ca n't afford it but it 's that impt we can not afford another week of the lunatic trump let alone an additional term
it was a great video it made me feel some hope
lol
not a single policy in his ad just attacks against trump
just heard biden is running after a 12 year old
did joe biden just apologize for touching little kids
people got fooled by obama 's warm and fuzzy speeches
now biden is going to follow up with his warm and fuzzy speeches which does nothing for me
they dumped kamala and beto get ready buttigeig
‚Äú trump is going to change the very fundamentals of this nation ‚Äù uhhh yeah
he ‚Äô s doing a great job at making this country greater every day
his sexually seductive behavior with children alone which is all over youtube will get him thrown out pretty quickly
he ‚Äô s framing his campaign on a straight up lie as if people can ‚Äô t look up what trump really meant
this kind of self-congratulatory bs can send people in such a rage they might vote trump again
watch as cnn suddenly drops mayor pete which they had been cradling for weeks and runs full speed ‚Äò into bed with biden ‚Äô with no eyebrows raised
economic issues are
right in front of cameras üòÇüòÇ pls lord make this happen
lol
these are dark times and biden and mayor pete would bring back light and unity
trump supporters are all negative angry and divisive people charlottesville is a perfect example of that
trump admitted and is proud to align himself with white nationalists
it 's so exciting to see joe run
the guy who cares about the soul of the country as he works with the wealthy to carve out more of this country
so i do n't see joe as nothing more than a corporate owned politician that is being handpicked by them to keep those with free ideas from being heard
after all we 're going to be hearing all about how great joe is to the exclusion of the other candidates
good people just misguided
bernie 2020 he has the policy and the most progressive way to beat donald trump
internal polls show bernie would win in michigan wisconsin and pa vote for bernie
lol running on the charlottesville hoax lie
trump said this shortly after saying you had fine people on both sides
joe bidden right decision at the right time to safe america from losing all that makes america america
however i think in the whole of america there should be better candidates hush
there is more to a person than a few of his statements
can we stop focusing on people 's slip ups and instead look at what they really stand for
i do n't know much about this joe biden guy seeing as i 'm not american but what he 's saying sounds a lot like the empty words i have become used to hearing from politicians and the media here in the netherlands
it 's all virtue signalling and trying to win personal arguments instead of debating actual stances
this mostly seems to come from the left and it makes everyone who has genuine thought out left-leaning beliefs look bad
hahahahahahahaha omg this is gold he even think he can win over trump ahhahahahahahahaha
the soul of this nation is in trouble lol
i do n't care which democrat wins as long as a democrat wins
look at this woman gushing over biden in an ecstacy as though she is madly in love
does n't she see that biden is so old and so white almost a corpse
every conservative is hoping biden wins the primary so he gets destroyed in the election
social democracy is different than socialism and communism
its what the wealthiest happiest and most free nations have
hide their own actions it is a shame cnn is bought and paid for by the
slavery vote trump 20/20 for national sovereignty and the free man
hourly reminder it 's okay to be white and i ‚Äô m pretty sure antifa would consider being called american patriots as a insult
trump as our president is apparently the greatest threat to our country according to joe
so you 're telling me selling iran weapons and voting in favor of forced busing in inner cities was totally fine
great stuff from cnn
it doesn¬¥t matter a single shit policywise if biden becomes prez or not so i¬¥m betting he¬¥s got an enormous chance of ¬¥winning¬¥the primary over somebody more popular
when they called violently attacking peaceful demonstrators who disagreed with them brave when joe biden himself called it american to be throwing piss jugs and trying to burn people with homemade flame throwers and acid and attacking unarmed protesters marching to keep a statue that is rooted in our history from being torn down
say it 's part of your culture and some tolerant group of lawyers will give you probono lawyers to virtue signal to everyone that they love other cultures and we ought to accept their good and their bad that our own culture is racist and evil even though it 's apparently so good everyone wants to fucking come here
personally i would like to see one of the younger people running win
old politicians is old time for new ideas and thinking the world needs people to be invovators
i guess that old white joe has to be the savior for the democrats in 2020
it seems the cnn anchor is willing to forgive him
she appears as if she is ready to rub one out right on the air
got ta love the irony in this speech
why are there so many fake accounts here supporting trump
the battle for the soul of our nation omg too much drama
if joe is elected we will have more senseless global wars sending our troops to fight wars foreign countries won ‚Äô t fight for themselves
biden i employ you to go back to the old folks home and do n't interfere with trump and his supporters from making america great again
like a hundred years old or what
you mean to tell me that in all of the usa they ca n't find any fresh blood someone with some fresh ideas instead of these old guys that are trapped in the greedy 80 's and who have no clue what is going on in the modern world
america needs some fresh ideas someone that is not a corporate puppet someone that can put an end to the rampant greed and corruption that has been drowning america for decades
how old is this dinosaur
ironically he misses the point that democrats share antisemitic beliefs with the far right
trump must be crossing his fingers that the dnc succeeds in ramming joe down our throats despite the multiple scandals groping abusing office as vp to help his sons company plunder the ukraine the corporate backers of establishment dems would rather lose with joe than win with bernie
more of the same too old bought and paid for career politician
did they give bernie sanders free ad time when he announced
this is so foolish and i feel he isn ‚Äô t interested in my demographic a denizen of the internet
there 's a lot of better people running that actually are n't pretending to be pro black
wow
spewing lies go sniff some more little girls hair
‚Äú courageous group of americans ‚Äù lol
doesn ‚Äô t matter what you think of the charlottesville marchers they had a right to be there and antifa attacked them because of an opinion
but leftists only like free speech when the opinions are approved by their democrat handlers
honestly trump is probably not a racist
he is an honest person who lets the words in his mind come out of his mouth
but in his heart he really means what he says when he says things like he wants the best for all americans and america
the good people he was talking about were the sons of confederate soldiers who were there to save the monuments from removal
why is biden running if 10 year old girls are not old enough to vote
wonder how many russians are on here
same old establishment politician bs and cnn anchors and their big money advertisers love it
hopefully the young enthusiastic great people of this country get out enough support for bernie or warren to stop this tool from gaining the nomination because that will either be 4 more years of trump or business as usual for the banksters war machine
biden 's experience can not be obama 's presidency because obama was simply put a charm and nothing more
i 'd love to get a beer with biden but not as president
now he 's old lying joe
cnn you know it old joe knows it
biden is a humle good guy so i guess stupid america will vote trump one more time
i ‚Äô m so glad biden is officially running
we don ‚Äô t want to pay more in taxes ‚Äù
how much did they pay you guys to cream yourself over joe
more lies to come
great
american workers need an exceptional award from uncle sam upon reaching 175 months of work employer or employee
also an award shall be given to all workers who s job requires them to work away from home 15 days a month or more on a regular basis
this will be a good bill for a senator or congressman to introduce for a vote
what validates the printing and issuance of money is any kind of legitimate labor and production for payroll purposes
taxpayers money is used for specific things it does n't run the whole world
look how much they love joe the pedo
funny how many dislikes cnn can get for their own channel
he wants to make america great again
now the dems wan na nominate somebody who can t attack trump for touching women against their will because he likes to do that as well
free hair shampoo for all 13 year old girls
automatic win for trump come on dems you got ta do better than the same ol same that ‚Äô s why donald won in the first place
so is biden going to talk about policies because he doesn ‚Äô t have the best track record on for voting for the people
i like obama as well but just because he was obama ‚Äô s vp doesn ‚Äô t mean he ‚Äô s the best choice
this not the early 2000 ‚Äô s this is 2019
we need someone who knows what the people really wants
we need radical change not the same old thing
thanks but no thanks biden
stop telling us who we are and why we ‚Äô re special
first beto then booty judge and now you
you know who we really are outside of your entitled bubble
we ‚Äô re a nation of 320 million dummies who simply need health insurance and economic security without having to work 2 jobs
this is the best his million dollar pr firm could up come with
he doesn ‚Äô t stand a chance by telling lies it just makes him more despicable and unbelievable
why are so many republican/trump supporters commenting
do they not have anything better to do with their lives
the bias comes out full force as cnn tries to sell us on biden
trump booming economy america first strong security lowest unemployment for colored people
he really likes kissing babies and young children
joe ben have no chance of winning and it will be a waste of time and money
honestly i was defending biden until i saw him groping children
if she did n't stuff herself with cheap fast food she 'd probably not have that heart attack
better hope old joe biden does n't get into the white house because his cabinet will be filled with young little girls
trump will win again as a result
as a matter of fact none of these dems have anything good to run on
and cnn is n't biased apparently
luckily for donald trump there are dozens of democrats in this election
i expect many sexual assault allegations accusing each other of being racist sexist or xenophobic
get ready to go back to the 50s
it does n't matter if your parents were rich and you went to harvard you must embrace your true identity of black gay faux native american or female
it 's so easy joe ‚öò
i joe biden as president of united states will ensure that all little girls have good smelling hair and relaxed shoulders
‚Äú the president said there were fine people on both sides ‚Äù oh come on everyone with a brain knows he wasn ‚Äô t talking about the nazis and shit there were peaceful protestors on both sides
these people so obviously twisting trumps words is the exact reason he will win again
garunteed trump 4 more years
why would they play the full commercial rather than report on it
awww looky how happy the cnn hacks are over the creepy guy running for president
why do n't they hold biden to the same ethical standards that they hold trump when it comes to his treatment of women
in fact our country could use a little more compassion
either trump wins again or dems create a toxic atmosphere to abolish their trust here to election time to re elect mr trump
remember parents if you see a van that says free candy on it in your neighborhood it 's just joe biden 's campaign vehicle
biden is the one trump fears the most
trump is the best president ever
the only thing stopping the dnc winning elections is their utter rejection of democracy that is thier rejection of listening to the people who want bernie
if however they want to win they can get the biggest landslide in decades by primarying with bernie
biden just wants power
he 's good friends with black people like mike tyson and has done a lot of pro-black things as president like creating the white house opportunity and revitalization council pushing for prison reform and the first step act prioritizing hbcus wanting school choice voucher programs for inner-city students so they can receive better quality education and driving down unemployment for blacks and hispanics to historic lows
it should n't matter what political party trump belongs to or how wealthy he is
he 's helping everyone and wants to put all americans first
all the best for 2020 creepy joe
hmm not bad announcement
secure the bag
will have to be ready to defend themselves against joe biden ‚Äô s groping
he loves to pull the ladies and the young girls close to him
this old fart üí® is a real dirt bag
lol brave woman lost her life lulz
here 's the problems with old uncle joe biden
first of all he 's a dummy and a 2 time loser
third and most important old uncle joe is just too damn old
old uncle joe would be 78 in 2020
david gregory a cnn reporter just said ‚Äú economy stock market americans being safe ‚Äù are all strengths for trump but obviously he isn ‚Äô t fit to be president because he isn ‚Äô t a nice guy
people will never learn the establishment wants biden he is bought and paid for just like most the the rest do some research
cnn is alienating themselves from their own mindless sheep they created over the years
he clearly did not refer to neo nazis as ‚Äú fine people ‚Äù
13 million more people were added to medicaid
11 million more people were forced onto food stamps
the percentage of 18-34 year olds living with parents or family hit a 70-year high
the social security disability rolls increased by 5 million
first administration not to achieve a single year of 3 gdp growth
wow
first of all the attack on donald trump is totally bogus
his words are taken out of context to make it seem like he said something that he really did n't say
that 's like saying we are all just mindless minions under the direction of an almighty powerful president who controls what we think what we believe and what we do
then right after this ridiculous claim biden states that america is an idea that 's stronger than any army bigger than any ocean more powerful than any dictator or tyrant
he should have added except for donald trump is stronger bigger and more powerful than any of these things because i just told you that he has the power to forever alter the character of the entire nation
in other words he is claiming that if he is elected he will be the who can be the almighty powerful president who can prevent us all from totally losing our identity and character as a nation
cnn you and all his other supporter 's disgust me his videos are all over social media with in appropriate behavior with many children and your all still willing to advertise his run for president peadophiles are the absolute worst but all you supporter 's willing to protect him from being criminal charged are as guilty of crimes against children as he is you 'll do show 's about arresting mother 's for failing to protect their children bit all of you and so many others do the same thing
he opens with charlottesville virginia the liberals new rebel yell
is there no depth that democrats will sink to win
uh the gay muslim crooked hillary pencil neck shifty schiff eric can i hold your balls on my chin holder lie retta
lunch her quick etc
so he 's going to be more of nothing for the country if he 's elected
he did n't say anything just pretty words
wow
they are so excited about biden
come on cnn everyone on this panel love him and making him sound like he 's the savior
too old
does n't he sort of remind you of one of the old klan grandmasters in the 1960s
remember when he described obama as the first african-american who was sort of articulate and clean
truly bizarre stuff
creepy joe is in it to win it lmao
further he is nothing more than a promise everyone everything and deliver nothing to all career politician
you saw it here first
lol he lost twice to both hillary and obama he will just lose again.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
it would be an interesting race both president üêàüêÄgrabber and biden have both been approved by the hand-picked selected imperialist electors in electoral college not to be confused with ü§°trump university.‚úåü§†üëçüá∫üá∏
joe biden lied about president trump just like the media has about the speech he gave on the tragedy in charlottesville when president trump stated there were fine people on both sides he was talking about the ones in favor taking down a statue and the ones wanting to keep it up he was not talking about white nationalists neo-nazis the ku klux klan and the leftist protesters in antifa he flat out denounced white nationalists neo-nazis the ku klux klan and the leftist protesters in antifa
does n't that make you excited about all those policies he might implement if his corporate handlers let him
üòÇ lol
these liberals dont have a chance in hell of winning
the most powerful economies and stock market under trump like we have
easy win
someone needs to tell sleepy joe he is running against 19 other democrats right now not president trump
so biden starts his campaign lying about president trump beautiful
the video does n't lie and if you were interested in the truth it 's right there for all to see
he looks like the old captain america in the movieÔºåi vote himÔºÅüòä
make america great again
im glad he decided to run here 's
nice
hope bernie gon na win
cnn is real newsüòÇ üì∞
trump now has absolutely nothing to worry about
im happy as fk also not only cnn so cnn has biden trump has fox so all you trump trolls need to eat biden shirt biden 2020 and beyond
great
lol
good luck pedophile joe biden
even obama would n't endorse you lol
everyone at cnn looks real happy that there buddy biden is running which was expected also biden opening up his campaign with race politics what is expected from democrats everything has to be about race and put american divided against each other
thank you mr biden such a powerful video so proud to be an american
if our votes really mattered they would n't let us do it mark twain
the best way to control the opposition is to be the opposition vladimir lenin
meet the new boss same as the old boss pete townsend
the big club cabal decides and consents to who holds any such high position
great announcement video
bernie sanders will win the 2020 presidential election
the most promising democrat running right now probably the only one to stop trump driving the us against a wall
lol
i love it
more signaling from dnc that they 're not hearing us
o well guess that 's it for all the other candidates we know exactly who the dems have chosen to lose to trump in 2020
it 's nice to see the bernie sanders supporters acting like mature adults as they always do
or more importantly you or they may not even be american
but he has topped every single predisessor as far as lying self-interest corruption and just his general incapacity for the office has resulted in nothing like what you ‚Äô d hoped or intended it to be
the ‚Äú swamp ‚Äù he promised to drain has become his new home
but they will fly open when you realize the gaping lack of your usual depended-upon tax refund
like it or not your eyes fly wide open in shock and betrayal
guess what you ended up doing with your ‚Äú little prank ‚Äù was do nothing other than burn down your own house
it is time to see exactly what is right in front of your face
but you unusually will soon have the opportunity should ‚Äú the swamp monster ‚Äù still be golfing at maralongo on your dime undo the mistake you made
this ‚Äú great deal maker ‚Äù
he has accomplished nothing but a huge tax break for the rich
but you can now choose to live as you once did a reality-based life
do you know that the ‚Äú mainstream media ‚Äù including cnn and msnbc and the new york times have won collectively over seventy pulitzer prizes for excellence in journalism between them
i sincerely even after being rather snarky here myself believe that you can use your five senses kept in fine fettle i suspect with the assistance of obamacare and make not only the vital small yet hugely necessary mental adjustment necessary to undo your mistake but to make the leap it will require
sleepy creepy touchy old man joe running for president he will be touching more kids in plain view while campaigning
first 10 seconds look at 'blinky noddy the reporterette üòÇüí¶
trump knew how to connect to millennials by doing new things like engaging his demographic through twitter
these baby boomer democrats have too many skeletons in their closet
they shoulda put the young latina woman to duke it with trump
cnn start showing more agenda on bernie sanders
we already have excited and fresh candidates for the presidency
crystal ball says trump 2020 win
with majority of the popular vote for the dems
everyone is attacking the loud mouth instead of looking at the root of the cause
yang won ‚Äô t win most likely but check him out on ubi etc
will be hilarious to watch the bunch of fools lol
funny how he waited until one day after the shethepeople conference
all in all glad to see 20 running piss away that money
red rover red rover send mr groper right over
joe can win it all
he is coming for trump directly
joe is an establishment puppet watch him take corporate money pack money oil money super pack money ect
cnn and creepy joe are a good match
if the establishment pushes biden through the primaries whether legally done or not enjoy four more years of trump for your greed
he just rubs me wrong lol
get happy cnn
trump was not talking about nazis being fine
yay üôå so many young girls will get touched and rubbed during the campaign trail üëß
joe biden america needs more victim complex and transgender bathrooms
it would be just obama light
obama hillary pelosi and the democratic leadership make sure he is the candidate in 20
if you actually listen to the president ‚Äô s speech he said there are good people on both sides of the confederate statue removal debate
bernie will lose the primary however
but to win you need at least 50 of the votes
with all the hit pieces bernie will get the most votes but no 50
in the second round the super pack delegates will come in
and then will biden or harris win and than trump have a second term and the russiagate will rise again with mueller 2.0
i think joe biden will win the nom and then die with a heart attack and be 6 feet under by election day
bernard is the only one capable of taking down trump
more cooperate democrate
wow
great announcement
good luck joe
my first time voting in 2020 and i 'm voting for trump
u or the clinton 's or the rest of the demonic rich pricks
hillary 2.0 do you want trump to win
biden is how trump wins
i could come up with a better healthcare plan than what politician 's would
go home biden no corporate democrat can win 2020
cnn is so happy to push for joe biden
whatever your party affiliation is i think this race is gon na have to be more substantial on policies and less about emotion
i 'm excited at the possibility of america waking up and paying attention
will at least be better than trump
trump is going to win regardless
wow what a great message for all americans
anyone anyone at all is better than trump admittedly i would like to see elizabeth warren win or bernie not sure yet but if it takes biden to bring us home to the business of being america rules america and not russsia stealing america via putans puppets who foy a voice and platform took to have their individual pockets and rise to power the current president and all his cronies who cant wont do their job as a party not due to loyalty to individual 1 but out of fear that they will be seen found out implicated exposed for the disgraceful dishonest we sold our country to an enemy people i dont hate trump or the republican party i simply hate hatred so who ever has the best chance in bringing us back to the nation we have always been both here at home and to foriegn countries america the beautiful peace and more power 2 u
it 's never been perfect but we were always welcoming and we lost that let 's get back to what we the people want
the only reason joe biden is running is to keep bernie sanders from becoming president
to secure the nomination you will need to get a majority of the delegates
that is precisely the reason so many candidates are running
to all but make sure nobody wins in the 1st round
joe can win even if bernie got more votes in the 1st round
this will lead to the same exact thing that happened in 2016
they might not like the kids in cages but not as much as they like their trillions in tax cuts
the only way to win is for him to get 51 of the delegates in the 1st round
cnn was so happy they couldn ‚Äô t stop smiling
unless bernie drops out or becomes biden 's running mate trump will win
most qualified
we love you joe biden
believe all women right
he had a few good memes with oblama that ‚Äô s it thats it
well now this get 's even better d
yawn biden ran for president three times in 1984 1988 and 2008 none successful
this seems like an ad for general election not the primary
in all seriousness if the democrats want a realistic chance against donald trump then joe biden is not the one let 's get a andrew yang tulsi gabbard ticket why elect old establishment elites
edit i 'll probably end up voting for trump because knowing the dnc they are probably foaming in the mouth for biden and will make sure he gets the nomination shame
i the see the trumpsturds is getting nervous
hahaha trump will be dancing of joy sleepy joe is running trying to keep hillary and barrack out of jail
campaign kickoff video that says absolutely nothing about his policies
is this the first presidential candidate to announce by video rather than speech
why so many dislikes on the potential savior of the dem party
joe biden is garbage and im a democrat lol
he went to parties with a pedophile and have been accused of inappropriate unwanted touching by multiple women
joe biden will win
well the russian trolls were clearly ready for this to be posted
they sure were chomping at the bit waiting for biden huh
biden is right
wow
apologetics may not be the most effective way to launch a campaign
lmao look at cnn doing this worship-piece on biden
lock your young girls and wives away to keep them away from joe biden
even jeff session push joes hand away from touching his granddaughter jeff session knows what really goes on that 's why..it 's all on youtube
not fake
america needs a social democrat as president
i was supporting bernie until he said he supports giving murderers that are still doing time the right to vote
nope felons should be given the right to vote but only after they have done there time
is n't there many videos of this guy touching children in a way that no one would want their children touched
good i like creepy joe as a losing candidate
biden 2020 a breath if fresh hair
you know there 's not a dry pair of underwear at cnn today
creepy uncle joe is running lol
having the word lie in your campaign slogan during this trump era seems like pure suicide
it 's the whole let 's focus on social issues because i have nothing to offer in terms of economic justice gambit
if you want to win you 're going to have to bring policies that actually help the working and middle class
all you people who lives in wisconsin pennsylvania ohio texas and florida better vote democrat in 2020 because you need those 5 states to win the electoral college
taxes good lol who isn ‚Äô t running for president on the democratic side
wow the right wing rutjobs are out in full force in response to this video
the democratic establishment think they can win the so called moderate republicans by nominating biden
just like trump said if obama and biden were so great he would n't be president today
gon na be fun seeing two 80 year olds fighting for second place
bernie is the front runner lol not biden
of course the establishment news network is so excited about biden
you do not come across as sincere
just the same old words and not even close to the energy of obama
creepyjoe lol
he 's going to get torn to shreds by the generations of americans he personally had a well intentioned hand on screwing over for his own personal gratification
when trump said good folks on both sides he meant republicans and dembulbs not neo nazis of which there few
young voters are crucial and we need them on board
at this very moment
the rest are just saying best things against trump including the new entrant
talk policies and not bad mouthing trump
sanders is actually better than you
go to sleep old man
i really don ‚Äô t care who it is i just want them to beat trump and be a good president while in office
more like a battle for his ego
bernie for purpose and action 2020
the most incompetent treasonous president in history
you 're exactly right we do need to remember who we are trump 2020
make america normal again joe
thanks and hope you win
i think the white supremacy is just a by-product of economic frustration like germans experienced as a precursor to wwii
and that means a more hybrid system of capitalism and socialism because it ‚Äô s becoming too expensive to educate ourselves and take care of healthcare needs on our own
low income housing is also a great idea
remember there ‚Äô s no homelessness in the netherlands üá≥üá± and yes they pay 70 to tax but we pay far greater in credit card interest and the cost of higher education and healthcare
a racist has more chance of winning the election than anyone else
in this time with all the hate-fear to all that are different than yourself it will be easy for the buffoon to energize them
read it and weep many woman and young girls did n't like biden kissing feeling and sniffing them and yet cnn does n't bother
prepare for biden entire platform to be centered around how republicans are good people and not policy
the salty disgusting maga trolls are out on full force biden has them worried just look at the comments i smell panic lol
the others are open border communist who care more about illegals aliens than usa citizens
biden is a cool guy but where past having an ok run of the mill
we need a real blow to the head
i love puppet shows d
ironically joe biden called obama first clean and smart african american he ever met and he was 65 back then i mean you got the first mainstream african-american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy
no one wants biden except the dnc
same old geezers that run the government
need real change yanggang
the russians are in full attack mode
first
wow this movie looks great
very well done
so welcome joe
my favourite candidates so far biden buttigieg harris o'rourke and sanders so many great candidates
great now is big for the big leagues let 's go
why would i want 4 more years of that
when they act like they do n't need to get out there or say things it seems like they already know there going to win just like hillary did just saying
i 'd vote for him or pretty much anyone over trump but this his infomercial is pretty lame
it 'll be interesting to see him and sanders on the same stage
the 2020 popular vote will look like this video 's like-dislike ratio
the right rarely wins it
good to see biden confront trump head-on with the white supremacy stuff
if only cnn were even half as enthusiastic as this about the actual frontrunner bernie
i don ‚Äô t see what he can offer that the other candidates haven ‚Äô t offered the democrats ‚Äú more freebies ‚Äù
i 'd much rather see someone in the office of the presidency with vital experience not some novice apprentice mafioso wannabe 'businessman üåπ
who needs healthcare when you can have more neo-liberal corporatist platitudes
biden is 4 more years of obama
yes we are battling the soul of this nation because democrats are now killing full term babies
hey joe the attorney general wants to ask you a few questions its something about spying during the obama administration
biden is like a song from 8 years ago nobody wants to hear it
good i hope we can find more about his son and the billion dollar china deal it ‚Äô s time to start looking in to all the unethical stuff biden did for his son to make that billion dollar deal also awesome
welp another poster child from a bye gone era i hope the dems learn and pic the right choice to repersents the party or agent orange will sneak in again and we can kiss our representative democracy good bye
love it absolutely wonderful
trump 2020 lol this is great news biden ‚Äô s son has colluded with china before trump was ever thinking about running
soooo he focuses on racial conflicts that the establishment keeps forcing on us instead focusing on income inequality or health care or more importantly corrupt politicians who ignore the ppl and follow their donors yup jus racial conflicts that distract us from the important issues and platitudes
charlottesville had good and bad on both sides ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ the president was spot on
cnn is loving it already

he is a corporate pusher we need progressivesthat is what the majority want be honest cnn
does he not realize he is a old white man lol
good luck in 2020 anything to get donald trump out the white house
listen i know you all think biden is old hat and i do to
and live their lives like it 's golden with the few yrs
let these young folks have a chance at running this country
all i saw was 3 minutes of biden attacking trump what are your major policy positions sir
and to celebrate his announcement he went to kennedy elementary school and groped all of the children
people of america are smart and see
joe biden is the person that can whip the hell out of the lunatic at the ballot box where it really counts
jefferson owned slaves said a black women who had 2 children a year were more profitable then a farm
you talk a good talk biden but everyone sees through your bs
this is gon na be good
you have to really ask yourself the question‚Ä¶which if any is biden ‚Äô s ideology government philosophy social/economic theory
i haven ‚Äô t so far or ever heard him articulating any
only that artificial political smile more like a smirk but no real message to us americans especially those which bernie sanders so clearly and profoundly has expressed for years
now biden comes out of the clear blue sky and pompously declares that he wants to be our president
i know that ill-informed senior citizens full of old age fears see in him somebody worth vote for
pure hollywood movie bs
make america great again
were you better off 4 years ago
appeal much to the republican party biden
very interesting no policy
a man with a character what a fresh air we all can breathe in
go away joe with your super delegate corporate money
nope he is never going to win look at the energy level of donald trump the man got what it takes
did he live though the the civil rights movement
i 'm not voting for him i 'm voting for andrew yang but i felt very inspired and proud to be a american.this is coming from someone who voted for trump in the previous election
how wonderful creepy pedo joe biden is running all women men and especially children need to run hide and especially protect all children and keep them away from him
of course cnn is excited though it was all trump trump trump where ‚Äô s the actual ideas that people vote for
let ‚Äô s see how he campaigns i honestly think we have enough qualified dems running
great intro jb
yeah good luck w/that sleepy joe trump2020
just laugh üòÇ
biden is going to be in prison by 2020 along with most of the dnc and half the republicans
trump is the best thing that could ‚Äô ve happened to america since america was formed
trump never said the racists were fine people he was talking about the people on opposing sides of the statue issue
telling lies about what really happened and how president trump responded which the media is manipulating
the elites candidate for sure
joe biden hahaha
it is a broken record of great accusations
and what happens to great accusers and false prophets
i learn so much from the library that is all the words ever uttered
alexandria thanks you for preserving the word of a lion behind a fair o on desert plains we created monuments to time
in fair o
you better get down to specifics joe biden
looks like cnn just got a new darling from harris to beto to mayor pete and now uncle joe
that 's what got us trump in the first place
even the dms will kill ans shred him at the first debate
yes this is america and no one wants you as potus except the corporations and the rich to keep the status quo
just focusing on the racism and bigotry of trump is not gon na fix the gap of income and equality making the rich and corporations pay their fair share of taxes ending the illegal wars education and jobs
great news another idiot to laugh at hahahahaha
youtube search joe biden touching and see what he is all about
all bernie needs is good running mate
3 bidenabrams2020
barely 50k views
he will split the vote so trump can win he has no chance whatsoever of victory
biden is sending a great message but everyone andrew yang is the candidate to check out and vote for
trump supporters scream about him being creepy but don ‚Äô t care about their president saying he wouldn ‚Äô t kind dating his own daughter
lol
no one wants average joe
the dnc is going to use biden to screw bernie again hilarious
and trump wins again
into brainwash their people into following them and believing what they 're doing is right
who wants to vote a womanizer old man to be a leader of usa üôÑ
üëâüëâtrump 2020 you are the best president in the world the greatest president ever üëçüëçüëç
not joe biden we need someone new bernie 2020 ü§ôüèª
go home biden no one wants you
the candidate has to be authentic and specific end of story
trump we have a race problem in this country and the american people wants to know how are you going to bring the american people together and end racism in this country
i prefer joe biden 2020 more calm üëçüòé
lol
this ukranian natural gas company simultaneously gave bidens son a seat on their board as well all while vp joe biden was in kyiv aka kiev
that message was bold.loved it.great if he wins i will love to see kamal on the ticket
cnn is wet right now biden is running i wonder if they will attack him at all even one ioda the amount they did with trump
if he is the dem candidate trump will win again
this will be fun to watch the 2 billion democrat candidates running for president eat themselves up
this old crock with fading white hair reminds me in the old day all farmers used tie scarecrows on their farms
watch joe 's right eye he squints
the mega-wealthy can rest easy now with there corporate sponsor back in the race who will get all the unlimited financial banking they can give to ensure no change in politics
how libellous it would be hilarious to see if trump sues for this slander on charlottesville
biden is going to make trump a villain which meets trump on his own terms since he makes his opponents small
biden said something good during that trailer i stand by his statement and so should every other sane american do
he sure has not learnt his lesson and will lose again
no policies all i 'm good trump is bad with loud music ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
we know what you did and said creepy jo be thankful to be powerful enough not to be in jail right now
cringe worthy
we support you president biden from üá∏üá≥ you are truly an american i love those words who we areüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
laugh at this man as you want
sensible people will know biden is an honest credible hard-working man that this country deserves
joe b the only former vp not allowed within 200 yards of an elementary school
who better to replay the democrats broken record of white supremacy to us than good ol ‚Äô gropin ‚Äô joe
welcome to the race creepy uncle joe
c-ville marches had thousands of good people on both sides
check out prof doc jordan peterson who speaks out against these post modern marxists and the campus antifa
long live the lobsters
the only one who can directly defeat donald trump no one else
true power of america is the power of selfawareness followed by a strong mechanism of self-ajusting always towards the direction the best possible and to the most beauty in the world
that 's who you are and that is even more important than any choices to make
what are his campaign promises going to be primarily based on
lol
disliked by 1.4k ‚Äú very fine ‚Äù people on the other side
if biden is taking corporate big business big rich donors campaign money then he is no different than the other dems or a republican
your for the people backed by the people or your for corporate big business and the super rich
no grey area
he should do what a fossil does staying in a museum of natural history not running for president
awesome
going to be fun to watch them shred each other
socialist policies work exactly nowhere
step aside old man
democrats like me want real change
the fake media seems so happy that he 's running
trump refers to joe biden as ‚Äú sleepy joe ‚Äù let ‚Äô s be clear biden can do more for americans while he ‚Äô s sleeping than trump could do being awake 24 hours a day
joe biden is letting the american people know we have a race problem in this country and we need to address the race problem in this country and joe biden wants to fix it
he has so many bulls eyes on his back he 'll be obliterated in the polls before his campaign even gets off the ground
potus must be laughing his head off right now
if biden is the best the dems can muster trump wo n't even need to run a campaign he 'll just win by a landslide while sitting with his arms folded
here we go again another win for trump
since biden is already in the race russians wo n't be able to find nothing negative on him and assange is in jail
excellent
a real man is running not some scarred little bone spur russian patsy
love him
but he ‚Äô s great in israel
another old white guy who would be 86 by the end of his presidency
does anyone really think biden has a chance
he can not win
bernie is also not trump but he actually has policies and a good plan to help all americans
lol this is gon na be funny
he ‚Äô s too old too white too male
so much for the dems lip service that they 're the party for women and minorities
oh wow this is so exciting
lmao i wonder what my president trump will say about creepy uncle joe üòÇ

16:35 i never did politics now i do politics lmao
always keep the balance towards and protect the meaning right
calm and sober with the right steps
always keep balance calm and alert with the right steps
calmly focus on the right reasonable solutions instead of worrying about the problem
then he loses his bearings and forgets what he ‚Äô s saying and just stops trying to make coherent statements
he is really off the wall
this guy is a very confused/weird individual
you promised to repair many ships general mattis was telling you that
good job trumpanzees

lmao no comment out of 60 i 've read r for u
our real national emergency is in the white house
noble peace prize laurette you 're looking at him
it 's such an emergency the orange motherfucker went straight to the golf course
trump you could wrap america in heat-treated iron and it would n't make it great again
you can make america great again by quitting
more and more people are qualifying for angel moms
watch how fast that new movement grows
trump in full savage mode
i just love this guy
make him live right next to the wall and see how that works out ü§£
putin 's perfect puppet
trump has a deal with a construction interest and that is the whole reason for trumps obstruction of the process wake the f up
always keep balance and calm and the right steps
towards meaningful things and protecting right and fair things
i 've had more intelligent coherent conversations with people who were utterly baked
trump is comical ü§£ü§£
i ca n't escape destiny for scientific progress that i truly desire genuine scientific progress

lol yeah we got criminals here but they are n't criminals that are immigrants and yeah we need to get criminals out of our country starting with spanky orange bone spurs and his criminal family
it ‚Äô s an empty story that at the same time is powerful
good job trump ‚Äú zombies ‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

that 's got to be ready to put into place by now right
great speech mr president
man child throwing a fit nothing to see here move on currently looking for a üçº full of other people 's üí∞
i watched alec baldwin 's parody press conference prior to this and thought it was a little too over the top but nah
trump is exposing the true ignorance wickedness and godlessness of the real white man
most of you know it 's true
oh okay here we go again with it 's everybody else 's fault except mine right donnie üôÑ
you will never operate in russia that 's for sure
this dude had to be high
doing a multiple.experiment is a possibility because it 's very easy for me to improvise a method
this stuff is priceless
what about the people that live on the border and will have their property seized
this whole thing is just a fabrication and fear mongering
americans love the wall
if you deal with the devils they listen to you and gives you what you want but you are only a tool to a greater game
‚Äú we need new wall ‚Äù
6:09 what generals told him that the wall was more important than supporting our troops
you dropped a moab in afghanistan to order a new one where are the new ships
first off he had a republican led congress for 2 yrs not one time was it an emergency
trump being elected in the first place is a national emergency
you are cnn you are fake news lmao
yeahhhhh shut it down why dont u close ur gov forever world will be better w/out ur goverment
donald clearly doesn ‚Äô t understand how the drug markets work
cheating is n't really winning
he just says the exact same thing every press conference
the war on drugs only breeds more chapos
mexico is laughing at us right now
how did we go from a smart and a very good leader like obama to a mentally ill orange man
someone should tell him that the vast majority of drugs come through the legal border crossing
trump has bankrupted his real estate business now he wants to bankrupt the usa go figure
jesus christ this whole situation is just a giant temper tantrum this man is an embarrassment we need to impeach him as soon as possible
excellent
he could n't get the oil money first so now he wants the drug money got ta put the wall up to control it
that 's how far we have fallen
lol ronald rump stop creating a bump
ok calm down already
his next national emergency going to be because the media isnt nice to him
an absolute tremendous buffoon
and while other countries laugh at us slap to the face lol
would it be nice if orange clown has a stroke while he decare national emergency
absolute power
i ca n't listen to him more than 5 minutes what a disgrace
ok gop are you going to find your spines and stop this madness
he pushing for that wall cause the fbi is tightening that rope around his neck and he hopes to weaken the us so putin will be able to save him from prison
this is a circusshow lol
this is hilarious
lmfao thank you commander in chief for several more guaranteed seasons of dopesick nation
lets put national emergency on gun control first for most
want to make america great again
give me some since it 's not that much money
so the ‚Äú great dealmaker ‚Äù simply decided to steal the money from other projects ‚Äî including those that are genuinely effective in reducing the flow of drugs into the united states
what happens when we have a real emergency
our national guard won ‚Äô t be able to mobilize properly now
best part start at 3:22
great power is speaking people
trump claims to be the first president to make history you have for being the dumbest president in the wh
reduce/cut social program spending
i believe i have afforded this man more than enough time to prove at least to me that he could be presidential and wholeheartedly execute the duties of the office of the presidency
i do n't believe he is as rich as he claims
he preys on people using the services and products to improve the financial position of himself and his children knowing full well he has no intention to paying for these goods and services or otherwise stiffing them in whole or in part of payment
how about instead of a wall we feed the homeless and build more schools and shelters
listen i got way better stats than you
ok
he 's a very intelligent warlock a genius among geniuses
not everybody can play as my warlock because he 's so smart and you got ta be a very intelligent person in order to play as him
but that 's ok because nobody is as smart as trump
without any resemblance of a logical speech
works probably pretty good on dumb people though
look at all these politicians in the chat lol
the guy holding the real strings is probably so happy he could cry
great leaders throughout history have known and used this tactic since the dawn of civilization
they are online pushing both sides of a wall narrative because it is the ultimate way to achieve the greatest accomplishment
mission accomplished donald
i 'm sure vladimir is mightily pleased and you and your family will be bigly rewarded
funny how cnn did n't put the full length speech up watch the full thing people
how many more things are people going to disagree with trump over the country has improved in nearly everyway
better than doing nothing like in the past
we need to listen to this in a high speed
i love you trump ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
angel moms stand up turn around show pictures of their lost loved ones to jon
it must be hard to try and do good when parties are at odds instead of working together to better the country
i could not think about helping someone else if i do not take care of my loved ones first
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ is this what you call winning
fine now bernie can declare a national emergency to dismiss student loan debt and give us medicare for all to help combat the opioid crisis and climate change thanks trump tards
i think my dog üêï would make a better president
trump just said that we have 'more people coming into the country today than probably ever before
i am in mexico now and some people say it is a good thing to have a wall
cnn are not sending their best
donnie in 2016 all i ‚Äô m saying is i ‚Äô ll make great deals and we ‚Äô ll get them done and we don ‚Äô t have use to executive orders and all the stuff that obama is using which at some point i would imagine the courts are going to overrule in one form or another
pence in 2014 ‚Äú it would be a profound mistake for the president of the united states to overturn american immigration law with the stroke of a pen
signing an executive order giving a speech barnstorming around the country defending that executive order is not leadership and i would implore the president to reconsider this path and to demonstrate the kind of leadership that the american people long to see and that is that this administration would sit down with this newly-minted republican congress and find genuine common ground border security there ‚Äô s a series of piece-by-piece reforms that i believe could be advanced in this congress that would be in the long-term interest of the american people on this issue ‚Äù
i 'd love to challenge them to a fistfight and leave them for dead
a new barrack for the troops cost about 50-100m
so for 3b how many military people will loose for a wall that is proven to not be an emergency
this guys a joke lol
good lord
he kept the promise he made in the campaign the country comes first
10:18 love how he shoots his own argument in the foot here
i ca n't help but dislike whatever this guy says it 's like i 'm surprised whenever he gets anything right
but tbh this is probably good in the long run when this bozo is out of office the shoe is gon na be on the other foot
trump clearly does not understand he is the head steward of the nations funds the tax money of the us population is not trumps personal bank account
i have to say i have never known anyone like trump who can speak for so long and use so many words to say exactly nothing of note
next trump presidency is confirmed
new green deal good
now you are drugged like obama was before when he had to announce an unpopular decision you are an old man and your brain will disintegrate
say what you will but compare trump 's interviews from the 2016 to now and he has improved a lot maybe not on his ideas but he is much better at speaking and answering like a president
is this guy for real
questioning his own agencies numbers because he has biglier better more beautiful numbers from the man that sells him his tinfoil hats as well
have fun using all your emergency funds on the wall
im sure many will love to do it
season 3 of dumb-old trump the president is turning out great man great tv
what deal has trump made money on other than the tax cuts for the rich
the first thing i do during an emergency is go golfing too
i know i may be a young teenager but from what i know about government this should not be called as a national emergency please dont abuse your powers trump üò∂
that 's the real national emergency
the best us president since kennedy
trump 's new har should say loser
i am a 70 year old german and i wonder every day what this man does to his country and to the world
ha ha ha ha you 're lucky i do n't have the greatest military like rome in the past and the caliphate in the middle-east you will not work in banking industry
love this guy
the democrats better sign a national emergency for climate change
since apparently rules dont matter anymore
i like presidents better that are n't racist criminal spies
this is a violation of the separation of powers and an attempt to undermine the primary role of the us congress
i love the 1:10 minute mark
trump wants a mulligan for the first 2 years
i was n't able to do anything cause i 'm very very new at this and did n't know what the hell i was doing
he will win at the highest court since he changed the judge into achieving his ideology even though if it against us in general
then when we get a real president democrat in less than 2 years he/she can declare a national emergency on gun violence climate change and healthcare
you know things that have killed and injured more than some illegals ever did
this man is a straight basket case
drugs are coming into america more through shipping ports airports not the southern border
no sorry he is ann coulter 's president
yall best be saving your money and stock piling now this is crazy
it 's priceless
it 's hilarious
400k caught trying to cross between the ports of entry so who knows how many others actually got through
if you take down your current 500 miles of wall and remove your border guards how many people do you think would cross the border
if a country does n't have a border to control it 's legal immigration then what is it
you fired the generals who are advising you that they need more budget for repairs and new developments what did you do
you cancelled inf treaty and you ai n't got experienced generals
lmao people in glass houses should n't throw stones libtard
but still it 's still not bad enough yet for most to actually do something no we just settle for it and get the government we apparently deserve
trump the great divider
winning
even cabinet members have said he doesn ‚Äô t have the attention span necessary for very important briefings
exports to the u.s rose 11.3 percent year on year in 2018 while imports from the u.s to china rose 0.7 percent over the same period
it is very unnerving knowing that this schizophrenic man has the nuclear codes
this is the most embarrassing thing i 've ever heard/seen an american public figure say/do
that man is an absolute disgrace to the core values of the country
best president ever
what would happen if a hurricane or some natural disaster happens these are true emergencies
and all this has as much to do with a national emergency as his damn wall
the up shot of all this is he 's killing the old boy cronie system of the gop his base is starting to peel away thanks to his tax cuts and success of all his promises finish the wall
like america did with nixon we 'll learn from it and be better
lol
but i ‚Äô m going to call a national emergency üôÑ he said something true ‚Äú virtual invasion by these people ‚Äù he knows nothing about the government nor the military yet he didn ‚Äô t think what they were going to spend it on was important ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
they cut off most of the clips
this man is unhinged completely unbecoming of a president total disgrace to the office he holds
i ran on a simple slogan make america great again
other people may have missed that but sure i did n't
putin was happily demonstrating his discussion with the russian generals and the russian budget to develop the 500 km nuclear missile range and what did you do after cancelling inf treaty
we have so much money we do n't know what to do with it meanwhile the national debt is 22,000,000,000,000 and growing
this emergency is less popular than the wall itself
what happens if there ‚Äô s a real national emergency
would of been easy
i swear if this guys wins again in 2020
we could use the money in infrastructure relieve student loans help the homeless so many things we could use it for
america not being great again is not an emergency
lol
the guy 's family literally came here north america in the system they 're afraid of lol americans biggest pansies globally
had the run of the house and congress for the first 2 years and now he wants to call a state of emergency now really
just a curios point if you invited every person from around the world to live in your country based upon definable behaviour work study sensible ethics swear an oath to america and its laws why exactly do you still need ‚Äú walls ‚Äù
if there is so much money why not invest in infrastructure health-care and education
make this little boy take a piss test for crank amphetamine and everybody will understand so much better
this guy is better than bevis and butthead
hahahaha bye bye
or maybe we are getting soft
oh yes donald you do everything much better than any president and that 's what you want us to think
3:28 wow
that 's the problem with this beautiful nation it 's half of the country does n't even understand the constitution
have written many pages of theory about an integrated north american alliance albeit at the moment can not finance it so am calling for the people 's support
come show love
wow
this border wall will only keep the good people from crossing
former cartel leader jesus zambada garcia testified about drug lord and mass murderer guzman 's use of tunnels to illegally enter the usa a tunnel is the most secure way to cross drugs to the us the easiest way to cross over weapons zambada garcia testified
most drugs are smuggled into the united states onboard fishing boats trains tractor-trailers and ordinary cars that come into the country at legal ports of entry according to former cartel members who 've testified in the trial of notorious cartel leader joaquin el chapo guzman
lol what a nutshell the only national emergency is trump himself
this ca n't be real life
how is he fit to be president he is clearly going senile if his family cared about him they would put him in a retirement village where he could cheat at bingo all day
donald trump is a man who has a hard time remembering the names of world leaders but without prompting of any kind he has regurgitated russian propaganda
june 26 2016 article in radio liberty radio free europe
moscow has issued its strongest warning yet over the prospect of montenegro becoming a full member of nato
donald trump has drawn fresh scorn for attacking montenegro whose people he described as ‚Äú very aggressive ‚Äù suggesting the small nation could be the cause of a third world war
one of putin ‚Äô s first acts in office was restoring the stalin-era national anthem
they were right to be there
he just straight up admitted this wall was only for the 2020 election smh
he needs to talk less any maybe the dems won ‚Äô t have as much ammo
you are actually aware that there is another hurricane season coming
hey america more money in my pocket and my trump family we are the greatest family in america right supporter
since he is the national emergency what is the plan of action people
we need new wall president donald j trump he sounds like he 's stalling every time he speaks
it 's amazing how much trump hates president obama and he 's jealous of him too
trump and hillary were best buddies when they were spreading that birther lie about obama
you can ‚Äô t sit here and say he only cares about a wall he only cares about building a wall it ‚Äô s much more in regards of protection
haha severeüëå
great guy
we love trump
if i had a dollar for every time trump knew what he was talking about i ‚Äô d have exactly 0
trump you boast about how much money you have and how much you love your country
america might love you more for that
the ignorance is strong with this one
wow
if gun free zones only stop law abiding gun owners then how is a wall going to stop criminals
‚Äú the president is incapable of articulating a coherent plan to establish operational control ‚Äù charlie dent
by 01:45 one is inclined to foresee strong arms coming into the shot with a straightjacket and leather harness enveloping the blithering idiot as he is whisked away nay 'stepped up to a better place
do n't be fooled by either sides commentary both democrats and republicans want national emergency friday 15th 2019 starts martial law gray state we 'll see how fast they escalate things from here
it only took one gunshot to start world war 1 it took one act of national emergency to create what we will see in the near future
hmmm is that really all that surprising
maybe trump needs to round up all his rich pals and 'pass the hat those crooks and scammers sure got the dough
they may need to postpone that next mega yacht or new boeing jet for a year or so but if they really love 'murrika it should n't be a problem
lol joke
the rats could not have helped the drug cartels with human trafficking any more if they had tried
america will need to take a long hot antiseptic bath when trumpski is eventually incarcerated
create new jobs
build a nice wall i do n't have anything against beautifying the brims brails and borders of the county but make it less racy for the countless of legal migrants who are already there and have kept the law
legalize coke make more money
better rotc
so much money
could contribute to lower obesity in army dilemma if offered to young adults 18~30
double negative lol have money not know what to do with oh we waste so much money on lol immigrants who go to work l
btw you do n't think they 've really stopped do you
we 're the worlds super power dominate n.k
is this saturday night live
the wall was an aide memoir to remind this 'high iq to mention immigration
to be fair obama declared an emergency over flint water crisis
and years later it ‚Äô s still not fixed so i have reasonable doubt about any of this or the copious amounts of other ‚Äú needs ‚Äù of real people will be met within a reasonable time frame
trump is the best president ever
america has always been great orange juice
i do n't want to sound like an alarmist but this is the first time in my life i 've ever wanted to take my kids and move away i want no part of this idiocracy
i will wait for more signs because i can read between the lines but i ca n't work in a racist environment specially white people 's jealousy can upset my mood and concentration
you do n't need it but it 's free so why not
the wall wo n't do much of anything besides stop foot traffic over the border to an extent
i ca n't afford a wall in my own backyard what makes you think i can afford one for thousands of miles lol
russian interference in us elections is a real national emergency
for those who disagree please make your large checks payable to the trump foundation
lmao
when you think about the kinda numbers yer talkin about you have 700 billion dollars when i need 2 or 3 billion out of that for a wall which is a very important instrument for the military because of the drugs that pour in and as you know we have uh specific rules and regulations where they have uh drugs and what you can do in order to stop drugs and thats part of it too we 're taking a lot of money from that realm also but when you have that that kind of money thats going into the military its a very very small amount that we are asking for
theres much more to come from cadet bubblehead
nobody knows more about hypocrisy than he does
i did n't need to do this but i 'd rather do it much faster ‚Äù
you voted for him good luck america
his facts are based on the latest sicario movie he watched and he thinks it is real
funny how chain migration does n't include melania 's family
and trump admits this is not an emergency he just is throwing a tantrum because he wants a wall now and forgets to mention that he promised mexico would pay for it
he also makes up his own facts which are not the real ones
2020 can ‚Äô t come fast enough
make canada great again
my brother use to be hooked on meth he use to talk in circles like this never processing a full thought or sentance
because every clerk at walmart has to be drug free why not the this babbling bully
wow
very interesting
you win you crazy lefties hes now letting all the immigrants come to your cities so you can take care of them like you said you would
so he wants to build a wall to keep out criminals and drugs but he is diverting 2.5b from counter drug activities and cites in the emergency declaration due to the recent influx of families coming to the border shows his true motives not for america 's safety or well being just so he can make himself look good
there is an active shooter in aurora il right now
2 more years to go of his lame-duck illegitimate presidency and then onto the ash-heap of history he will go
i don ‚Äô t understand how someone can watch and listen to this guy and come away with any opinion other than he isn ‚Äô t right in the head
how do you read a mafia 's way of thinking let them go to courts we own the judges
this person does n't really care he went golfing after his fabulous speech on iran drug dealers human traffickers etc
worth more
donald john trump is one of the most honest and righteous man i ever had the pleasure of working with
he is a truly great friend and we agree on almost everything
donald trump came to hospital to see me after i got into a fight due to my own fault
he is not a racist he truly cares about the black community and wants to make it better
i would truly consider one of my greatest friend and ally
illegal immigration is one of the greatest threat to america and our way of life
many of them carry drugs weapons and are criminal exiles in their own country in central america and we will not take them
seems weird how trump is making all these great achievements to better american lives but many do not appreciate his accomplishments
people brainwashed by democratic social media
china make world peaceÔºånatural way is the best without industry pollutionÔºåthe law of karma cause and effectÔºåpure heart pure land„ÄÇfighting for land and money is fake„ÄÇ
billions and billions and billions and billions in this beautiful country ha ha me me me i i i did sounds like he run the whole nation by himself
actually illegals make the best workers because they are so happy to have a job even for minimum wage they will do anything not like some workers who think this and that is beneath them
if wealthy american companies would expand a little to south america they could create a lot of jobs for them
in fact with t 's new china tariffs south america could begin to compete
how many people of color have assassinated any potus
lol
that thing about obama causing more debt than every other president combined cant be true right
is trump going to have family members hold up pictures of loved ones killed today in shooting duh of course not
good lord
i just watched this whole thing and not only do i think that anyone who watched it is actually a little dumber but i do not think he actually answered any question
on top of that i 'm fairly sure he did not complete a single thought
more lies and bs from the orange monster
if this dude had an administration and aides that loved and respected him you would hope at some point in time during this rant they would have come outside and said ok mr president there is a very important phone call for you that we need you to take
make america great again
republicans want a wall that the gangs will just tunnel under with their drugs and democrats want to take away guns while not actually going after the kind of gang members that cause market crashes which arguably cause more pain and suffering than all the guns of the world combined
i wonder how many wallstreet coke heads would stop doing drugs if they knew just how far their drug money travelled
i 'm probably going to be snuffed out for saying this but i also believe we 're closer to having a real racist dictatorship here in the united states than we 've ever been
these things always start with some form of national emergency then the old government buildings are burned over night then the undesirables are rounded up villified and 'cleansed
then the country can truly be great and progress
he is willing to take money from all those people who have lost everything the own because o real national emergencies to be able to say ha ha i got my wall
enough is enough everyday it 's something with him i do n't ever remember this much upheaval in our country and all because one arrested development person
he is doing the best he can
the real national emergency resides in the white house
there is no doubt that he is one of the least eloquent speaking presidents that has ever served but how can people actually argue that one of if not the single most powerful and wealthy countries on this planet does not have a level of border protection sufficient in safe guarding the interests of both the state and its people
you spend exponentially more on the military than your peers have bases scattered in every corner of the world and yet refuse to admit that even if the proposed wall provided marginal results it would be beneficial in reducing the flow of undocumented migrants along with further mitigating the flow of illicit narcotics
this just seems like common sense and yet i know i will be roasted by posting this lol
people talk a lot about many things they think they understand well like they are in the situation where it is not easy to make decisions
drugs and ms13 lol what bout bloods and crips and chinamen lol just unite with mexico they have awesome food and great people what are you really scared of what cocaine
cause last i knew most drugs we got are made in the great states of america and the others are from china silly stupid man he just lied on his campaign and is in a panic to get done what he promised remember walls work lol but boats and planes are modern
f it love thy neighbor
are those rumors about snorting adderall true
he left out the dea 's 2018 annual drug threat report that states that the main flow of drugs entering the us is coming in through the ports
maybe just read the whole report if you 're actually interested in reality
that ‚Äô s answer enough for me and most others to know where he ‚Äô s getting his numbers from his tubby arse
trump is about as ready to be the leader of the free world as my five year old maltese puppy dog
in fact my yapping 9 lb dog might be more more adept at understanding the job than trump always a low bar to clear
he he he he the sound of the voices of trump supporters is always about control and victory you are not your brother 's keepers like cain denied himself after killing abel
the only win he had was being elected and for that he needed russias help
now tax payers will be spending millions on legal fees for the impending court battles
we know trump has already cost us millions for his golf outings ca n't even imagine how much he has cost the tax payers for lawyers since he was fraudulently elected on his scams
liberals love to run their mouths
if the christians really believe in the second coming where will jesus be born
it 's all a distraction from 17 investigations and to play nice with hannity and limbaugh
the wall mexico wanted to build was made of old tires mud and garbage
shameful that trump used those poor angel mums as political fodder whilst so many more parents and children that he separated from their parents with no way of reuniting them are treated worse than animals there are now as of this week crisis overcrowding 30 children in cages for 15 that fact that this is continuing with little media coverage will go down as one of the greatest humanitarian travesties of any presidencies akin to some of the racial atrocities of the past
civil war i sure hope everyone is prepared for it
the true national emergency is the incompetent lying con man that is sitting in the white house you know the one that has told over 8000 lies in public or on twitter no telling how many in private the one that claimed that mexico was going to pay for his racist bs wall but now wants american tax payers to pay for after giving the top 1 and corporations the largest tax cuts in decades
the one that claimed he would only hire the best people manafort stone flynn cohen and gates all going to prison if you still support this lying racist con man then clearly there is something wrong with you
the republic of usa will win against socialism
how old were those ms13s
donald duck could of made more coherent statements than this guy or did we elect the wrong donald
just look at china things get done fast and efficient
america became the greatest country on earth because of ideas
recent events after trump was elected thanks for all believed in him voted for his idea
trump has presented facts he combined with ideas to build the wall constitute the greatest force in the world
it is possible to stop an army of a million men but you ca n't stop a good idea when it comes along to build the wall to stop the army
president you should already realize that you are a disgrace to the whole world
i believe that if you resign the whole world will vote so that you receive the nobel prize
mr trump you are a great danger to humanity
the biggest laugh here is that he has been building the wall all along while triggering dumbocrats every day with 3 second daily tweets
this dude can ‚Äô t keep obama out his mouth lol what a joke
wah this man sure loves lying
yup that was me before i came along oprah winfry was just a cashier at mcdonalds you 're welcome
people please give me a good reason besides hating the potus why we should not have a wall at the border
love this man a true leader
fair shake get rid o trump
you love our law enforcement agencies
right you and your republican cronies are doing everything you can to tear down our top law enforcement but then you follow putin 's autocratic plan to the t first you you tear down the law then you go after the press all those who can bring you down you have make them look bad in the people 's eyes and you have done a good job so far but there will always be more of us than there are of you and we have god on our side.prayer can break the strongest hold
lol cnn is pure anti republican propaganda they are only saying ‚Äû bad trump ‚Äù he won with clinton and he is a presiden so he is deciting in your country
i really do not know how it is possible that there are people who when they hear this maniac do not realize that apart from the title of president he does not have anything else of a real president
but what will americans do when they can no longer get their cheap drugs from the south
the real reason the so-called democrats are against the wall is that it will greatly impede if not stop the flow of illegal aliens aka democrats from across the border s from as far away as perhaps even south america
since people wo n't allow a trump statue with they money him do the wall i think him wants not be forgoten and is why him wants left something to people remember him
my 13 year old autistic son has more common sense than this orangutan
that 's the sound of liberal heads exploding
his mental illness is more apparent every day
wow
so trump is going to declare a national emergency over an emergency that he created then steal 8 billion dollars from the budget to fund his midevil wall and completely reject the democrats bills aimed at realistic border security that would aim at every single sector or the border yet his idiotic supporters still think all of this is great
y'all need an ass whooping for real
my faimly have lost a loving and beautiful mom to opiate addiction this last year
im suck of everyone democrat and republican turning a blind eye to the opiate problem tell my grandchildren the lost their mom that it 's not a crisis no one knows the pain of losing a loved one from a drug problem in this country until you 've lived it
no construction business with ties to the trump company should be considered for the job since ultimately a big chunk of that money would go straight into the pockets of trump and his family
since he is now making the taxpayers in this country pay for his wall taxpayers which he is not one of trump should be required to take time out of his executive time to report to the citizens of this country what is being done with the money and how much has been spent this report needs to be fact based and not one of his fantasies
why is he catching his breath between words
could it be that he 's obese and not as healthy as the docs said
so he admits his comment about already building more wall was bs
bush added 5.85t and trump has already added 2.25t in first 2 years
for all his talk about how much debt obama added he is on pace to match him
i mean to me it ‚Äô s not bad lol whatever it sounds like a joke or this is a stupid thing still got ta say not bad to me
i 'm a real deficit believer who 's more crazy tho we watching
or him captivating
no what are you talkin about the real america is the republican i heard they took a iq test and their scores are lower than a peanut and he 's the head peanut this guy is really a cartoon
it is a violation of the constitution set up just to prevent this kind of executive abuse but trump would n't know what the constitution says because he ca n't read above a 2nd grade level no offense to 2nd graders who at least are earnest and willing to learn
he makes up his own as he goes along how sad is that
his own administration are dishonest with him
money is n't real
debt is n't real
trump is great

vamericacwas never great have you ever read a historical novel based on the history of this country i doubt it as you would have learned how mean spirited those who had were to those they hired the native people the black people

why is all this money going to a wall instead of school protection you know to prevent school shootings better education
make america great again
funny
why is it when democrats had control under obama that the immigration process was n't fixed then
problem is most of the voters in this country have caused this
the reality is the funds posted in this omnibus bill were already appropriated for the wall whether anyone liked it or not
it 's a invasion aww run for the hills the mexicans are coming
america is becoming a laughing stock
or absolutely nothing not one single penny from the innocent american taxpayers
for anyone with at least a third grade education i ‚Äô m sure they see right through the nonsense and lies
lol trump is really ridiculous his entire admin gameplan resorts on building a wall across mexico border to trive upon construction interest
and his supporters most of them white thrash biased/racist lower/middle class mass is loving it
congrats on making this country great again
close the border completely then and get all major us corporations out of mexico
‚Äú we have soo much money i dont know what to do with it ‚Äù your incompetence is showing
make america a great laughing stock
trump is great
keep doing a good job mr president
lmao
lol
he 's literally the best president the us has had since jfk and done more good for 'merica than many past presidents combined
he 'll win in 2020
well most of americans love him
if the dems dont put up a strong candidate in the next election he wins again easily
how high is the wall
lmao
this story is old
if you took a real poll i would bet his approval rating is above 50 percent
obama declared 12 national emergencies when he was in office for 8 years just because president trump has it you guys do n't like it but it 's okay for obama to do it right
i ‚Äô m surprised his dentures had not fallen out as yet
him being president it 's remarkable how much emphasis he put 's on there being an us vs them situation
especially when considering the only us he is refering to with any consistency is n't the republican party but his own administration
what is he up to truely
rest is pure ego-masturbation for open mic
majority of them come here for a better life
the majority of them are hard working and they do their best to stay out of trouble
i 'm not saying that 's right but this is anything but a national emergency
everybody else is ok with killing more babies and god is watching
hell is real and i would n't want to spend eternity with all those freemasons commies pinko 's and lefists constantly wailing in agony not to mention the stench
at least trump is n't swimming in that ocean of innocent blood the way margret sanger and her blood thirsty feminazi 's are
it ‚Äô s so funny coming from another page so many likes and positive comments and cnn pages is a bunch of dislikes and negative comments
im new to politics but i understand the division now
most americans want border security and to protect our sovereignty
im very happy i dont live in the usa
it may be time to move our loved ones out of the usa to protect them the us is no longer safe for anyone but the members of the republican party
lol
he 's so happy with his 52 polls
hahaha
the land oft the free held hostage by a mafiosi
man i love trump
enjoy your conniption fits leftists
honestly what is the difference between this and a president declaring an emergency to declare martial law
i guess you just have to tell them they 're winning and you can do anything you want
anyone who thinks the wall is a good idea should read ‚Äú in the strawberry fields ‚Äù by eric schlosser
truly unbelievable and even much much more
that was a very very long narcissistic rant talking about everything ‚Äú he ‚Äù has done to save the world and how he personally add the world a better place
he said that he put out a statement saying ‚Äú you better not and then they didn ‚Äô t ‚Äù implying that they stopped whatever he is blabbering about on trumps word alone
there was nothing surgical about what russia syria and iran did to the people of syria between russian carpet bombing runs and syria ‚Äô s chemical attacks on their own people left many citizens no choice but to exodus their homeland to simply live
then he speaks about this nobel peace prize as if he did much of anything when it was the president of south korea that did 99 of the work
the only thing trump did was come in at the last minute and talk to kim jung mainly because kim jung wanted to meet trump trump was/is a celebrity and he just had to meet him
i am always amazed how trump rarely gives details about anything just assertions and of coarse statements indicating that other people know nothing and remember nothing on trump knows and remembers pompous narcissist so glad he is the the leader of the most powerful country in the world no chance that could go wrong
sigh as an immigrant from a country where dictatorship happens i 'm not even surprised by the fact that we have a dictator-esq president
what kills me is that ppl in this country elected the dumbest and most idotic one of them all
greatest president in a long time
proud to be an american
the hypocrisy is soooo strong coming out of the obama years
president shall chusen some officers to recruit and train a well regulated militia as the bill of rights stipulates with the funds from the taxes only and stop every weapon marchands from any association right now
a national emergency is something everyone can see like a terrorist attack natural disasters or an epidemic like swine flu
a massive long-term construction project that will take more than a decade to complete is not a national emergency
this is wonderful
i really ca n't stand him
i would have loved to of seen some faces when they read it
i bet they hung copies of it in the bathroom above the urinals hahaha
to turn this country around for the better
good for him for staying on his feet little victories against this racist sexist anti american monster
anybody has their own opinion and we live in a free country i do think he is the best president we ever had
whole world is seeing there is less unity they should support the national powers they should respect their leader trump
honestly do cnn viewers even understand that we have legal immigration and that since the year 2000 legal immigrants to the united states number approximately 1,000,000 per year
the us is now becoming great again look at all he has done for the us but again people who hate him do n't care about this all they care about well i am guessing is hating him which the dems and news outlets have created
you may not like him but you have to give him credit for making the us great again and keeping his promises which career politicians do n't if you cant do that we really know what you care about in regards to helping your own us citizens and making their lives better
finally a president not afraid to tackle our immigration problems
no other country in the world has benefited from mass immigration
in the early 1900 's the industrial industry was booming and we needed workers
drones and more border agents will not
drones can be deactivated border agents removed then we are right back here at square one
haha i loved when trump called cnn fake news and told them to sit down üëåüèªüëçüèª trump 2020
barack obama was a much better president in sooo many ways
trump wins
good job trump
you ‚Äô re best ever
i assume the dislikes are at cnn 's expense because trump is the best president and cnn is fake news
best president of my lifetime
he said he has received billions and billions of dollars that he do n't know what to do with ignorance is blind to wise decisions apply it to your smoke and mirror wall and leave the constituents birthright needs out of the equation
trump os the greatest president
trump wins
i am not sick of winning
trump 's the greatest president we 've ever had
so many delusional cnn watchers on here
over 60k od deaths in america last year fentanyl and other drugs pouring over the borders many illegal aliens involved in the intentional murder and unintentional dwi deaths of americans old diseases such as typhoid fever out breaks in places like ca directly from 3rd world nations hospitals overrun with illegals who do n't pay their medical bills rampant 3rd world gangs just look at the ca prison prison system etc
damn right there is an emergency
and we will win this in the supreme court get ready for the wall and the end of the democrat vote machine thanks to the stemming of illegals who vote for the give it away for free party
this is a great day for america
lol he 's lying so much his teeth tries to escape what a con
clear some room on mount rushmore for donald trump the greatest president in the last 100 years
had to declare a national emergency the haters on both sides are n't willing to cooperate
he 's a brilliant brilliant man
i wish more people could think for themselves and not just jump on the trump hater bandwagon
fine
fine
it really feels like dems would rather see trump fail than have a safe country
beto literally just said he wants to tear down all physical barriers along the southern border
here is how to make america great again put orange in orange
america is more powerful now than ever before
trump is most accomplished president
people around the world wish they had trump for their president who fights what is best for americans
this dude is straight trash
i love our president üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
racism is a super inferior concept only extremely inferior people with low self esteem practice racism real talk
get ready to cry 6 more years libtards
great
it ‚Äô s such a beautiful day to be wearing a maga hat
the man who represents the most powerful country in the world
oh yeah if we have a fully open border more people will come in that want handouts and the democrats will have more power
he seems to barely understand how words work
what kind of agenda would cnn have to bring down immigration statistics
what an absolute douche‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
it 's hilarious how you democrat supporters believe that they 're fighting for you instead of actually fighting for their 2020 election
üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üí™america first
the best president in history
love that he 's building the wall
i love making liberals cry
the wall is coming folks and your precious criminals wo n't be welcome
america is so proud of trump
delicious libtard tears
latino for trump 2020
üôÑhe 's a complete joke
what a great president keep up the good work millions of americans are against illegal aliens crime drugs and guns coming over the border
that 's right bltches
trump wins again
good for you mr president
trump goes by his gut statistical wise
april fools i tought he was going to say that lol
2019 clown snow in the wh..promises to be even better than year 2018
today starts the day of martial law will see how fast things accelerate from here gray state
there are miles of drug tunnels that run underneath the existing border fences that have been discovered probably more we do not know about
even alcatraz island which you could argue was an optimal wall 2 of the population housed there was able to get outside the wall with the few resources and regular searches and almost no help from the outside
you really imagine a wall will keep out anyone who 's determined
if there 's so much money that he does n't know what to do with it he should put it into infrastructure building what needs to be built like bridges better roads put it into police departments for training put that money into schools and educational programs to help students or better yet pay off college student debt and make college free for all americans or pay military personnel what they deserve make the v.a
hospitals better the list goes on this just proves there is no money and he has no idea what he is talking about
you need more experience at chili 's oh my lord
if we have all this extra money why not do more to help the vets
classy
i will be grateful to god that if he wins another full years he would have to exit after it
cnn msnbc cbs nbc usa pbs cnbc foxb fxnws what is a life worth
what are 10 lives worth
what are their lives worth
would they be fair trade for security along our southern border in the building of a barrier fence wall
get off our high horses and protect our citizens along our southern border
so 5.7 billion isn ‚Äô t worth the security of the republic üá∫üá∏ the lives of families and children on all sides of the border
best potus ever
win win win
good day for the working class
nobel peace prize he 's on something right
your button may be bigger than his but the reality is they are both still in the button category lol
this man is n't competent to be in charge of a lemonade stand on a saturday afternoon let alone being president
he 's barely coherent
i could care less about the wall right now but if it works we will see
american banks are the real drug dealers 2 trump will take 7 billion dollars to weaken the military 's morale
great job us
great leader
people who have nothing to hide and want to enter the correctly not illegally
spanky you sound like a 17 year old kid begging his mother for money because you owe the guy down the street
how are american people still not taking any action against this clown
obama could n't do a lot because he was the first black president and a lot of people did n't like that and he did n't have people is high society like this clown
he a super genius with a big heart
brag about yourself because your a handsome wonderful president
does trump have a speech writer on drugs or is trump 's inane ramble all his own work
this will be easy for dems to win.cuz the facts r there is no proof of this same bs u bein sayin the same song over and over stop watching tv about mexican cartels
that 's really messed up
most undocumented are flying in and overstaying their visas
trump really wants to get a nobel peace prize
i ‚Äô m no longer embarrassed but i am very entertained
he may be the worst president ever but he is certainly the most hilarious man on the planet
absolutely zero self awareness and i love it
there is no balance if he limits himself to answering only the questions he wants to hear
looks like the green new state of emergency is getting closer to reality lol
i really just don ‚Äô t listen to the news anymore
this is exactly how dictators grab power they win an election they create fear it becomes a fake emergency they act beyond their laws and constitution they grab more power than previous leaders
the great part is that if this law is somehow upheld the next prez will make it a natl emergency to get off fossil fuel
awesome president
orange man good
trump knows that no matter what anybody says about him or his decisions his private access to the supreme court will ensure his success
i love trump so much plus he tall and handsome
god bless my wonderful president he the best he care about all of us
he has never been racist and he never will all black and hispanis should cross over he making you life better not just illegals like the left baby killer get away from the baby killer they are with satan
obama depleted our military stoked racism and gave a plane full of cash to iran and spent more money than all the presidents combined he said he would lower the deficit guess what he tripled the deficit that 's what happens when you put someone in office with zero business expierience
i hope the dems suggest to give him el chapo money and reminding him that american banks are the real drug dealers
he basically just told us all exactly why he 's declaring a national emergency it 's because of the 2020 election wow üòÖüòÖüòÖ
that tirade on rush limburg was just astonishing
when a national emergency is declared our constitutional rights are suspended thanks to george w bush and that includes the 2nd amendment
if he can take the military budget once he will take more to spend it again
take a drink every time he says billion jk that 's too much
so this is actually happening right now
america will never be great again
he approved a higher us military budget now he 's taking it again
now being one the best presidents he has made a new trade deal where we are getting billions of dollars
build the dam wall protect our boarders americans first the rest of the world comes second
well he has much more detailed reports than anyone and as he said his number one goal is to protect the usa i have a tremendous respect for this president and everyone in america knows there are way too many illegals in this country
no one in in large country can enter someone 's border undocumented
we will win this battle repbublicans create jobs libs create legalizing marijuana
he 6 1 and 265 with high blood pressure high cholesterol failing kidneys and a doctor who could n't care less
his days are numbered in more ways than one
let 's count how many times trump says billions in this one short video
why he sound like he about to choked ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
no matter what obama was wayy better and loved more than this clown
is this the reason that he is in love with kim
fun fact cnn has lost 25 of their prime time viewers compared to last year
i do n't care what anyone say 's if trump could he would deport all the black youths of the usa to africa if he could they kill more people than illegal immigrants they deal more drug 's than illegal immigrants they commit more crimes full stop
very presidential not
keep up to good work
how much is the wall gon na cost
since 2000 legal immigrants to the united states number approximately 1,000,000 per year of whom about 600,000 are change of status who already are in the u.s legal immigrants to the united states now are at their highest level ever at just over 37,000,000 legal immigrants
in the usa was here before trump came to office thank you very much
good for the american people
it ‚Äô s true
lol
well now at least all those poor trash in the non southern states can sleep at night knowing their son can get their lawn mowing job back lol
elect a clown expect a circus
just think now he ‚Äô s opened the door for a democrat to i don ‚Äô t know declare mass shootings a national emergency and causes guns to be dealt with and republicans won ‚Äô t have any right to complain if they let this pass
entitled thought processes much
the wall is coming to an america near you love it
glad he pointed that out because the msm sure as hell never will
the narcissistic personality is strong with this one
wall for trumptards is winning a political point but they camouflaged it as the greatest thing a us president must do with an unfinished wall for his 4-year term
i hope the trash that voted for him are happy
most undocumented immigrants do not sneak across the border a wall will do next to nothing to stop multiple tunnels most undocumented immigrants simply overstay their visas
sniffing his way through his lies again so a national emergency well this is going to put us to the test make america great again with a wall
is it that easy
build a wall and your great
well north korea has a great wall we can only hope he did n't get his ideas from north korea because the wall is there to keep the people in and not out
according to the u.s census commission illegal immigrants commit far more crime then u.s born citizens
anyone with a brain can understand this sense they do n't have documents and ca n't legally work here
many will find other means in order to financially support themselves
that way we will be able to see how he sees it and see if it works or full of it the pressure needs to be strong and based on truthful facts and unshakeable questions
drugs are coming in through the ports not southern border and caravans are not getting into the u.s what an incredible waste of money and resources just because he ‚Äô s to dumb or proud to admit he ‚Äô s wrong
fukhead u make america great again by changing things not by spittting everyone
trump wants to put a stop to it all together its that simple
if you can not enter this country legally then you do n't need to be here and should n't be allowed to be here
infact in most other countries if you get caught crossing their boarders illegally then you will be treated as a spy and a serious threat to their national security and in most cases you would never be seen or heard from again
trump is not telling people that they can not come to america he just wants people to do it leagally and be vetted before they can enter this country which they all should be
take a hint america he is right in building that wall and should be allowed to do so
it has nothing to do with human rights he just wants our country to be safe which he should be allowed to do as president of the united states
smh lol
0:42 we have so much money we do n't know what to do with it
most drugs are come to america by plains or boats and there are under ground tunnels if people want to get in
immigrants accounted for more than 30 percent of the federal prison population and nearly all of them are confirmed or suspected illegal immigrants the government said in a new report tuesday
what 's the point of building a wall that people can just climb right over
going against constitution and being a dictator doesnt make america great again
says hes got given so much money he doesnt know what to do with it then next second he says its not so much really
why cant even his thickoe supporters spot him contradicting himself so quickly
the reporter at the beginning who joked with trump and seemed nice will now have to come out and tell everyone how he hates trump or he 'll lose his job
hell yea my favorite part was him giving obuma hell for the nobel peace prize
i happen to live on the border and you would not be able to handle the things i have seen in my backyard
once during a rape in real time
we need the wall a hell of a lot more than the democrats need new criminals to vote lets put it that way
can somebody ask the real question which is which buddy of his will build the wall
how much kick back will be funneled through an alias company
god bless president trump the first family and the entire trump administration
history will be true about his legacy regardless the current fake media and bias against him america is proud and thankful for this great american commander-in-chief
thanks to this pos
trump said zte got a lot of penalties in a week right
first he mentioned the name of zte but he said ‚Äò zet ‚Äô later
he 's a lying c l o w n lol
i despise chain migration as do most americans
but his own squint-eyed wife used the process to bring her parents into the us
idiocracy at its best üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
bet that money will be squandered and the deficit is going to continue to rise to unprecedented levels
winning
not we won although that would not be the case he rarely if ever speaks of what he does for or as us
we have so much money we dont know what to do with it
pay chinaaaaaaa first
then pay 1 trillion in students loans and start fresh then re design a new healthcare plan for all
wow just wow
i am pretty sure that the majority of the estimated 20m 40m illegals did not go through the ports of entry
there have been several video documentaries showing illegals walking and hiding in texas arizona and new mexico
the religious right who he is hiring has done this for years
okay then but also a number of crimes commited by illegals who use guns
trump yhu sound very badmind
it ‚Äô s funny how you live in a democracy he is the president you voted for him not necessarily you he does what he says he would he is probably the most powerful man in the world and yet he is the stupid one
win lose win lose win lose win lose win lose win lose win lose win lose
and when she ‚Äú wins ‚Äù she ‚Äô s the only one that benefits from it
she ‚Äô s got so much money that she doesn ‚Äô t know what to do with it
what happened to that first yuge wave of caravan that was coming up to our southern border just before the midterms
she ‚Äô s built so much wall but can ‚Äô t provide even a picture of 100 feet of said wall
we need a safe country and we will have the wall with or without the demonrats
3 hours of blowing hot air is all that 's required to intrigue this clown
look full disclosure ive been smoking some weed but i feel i still make more sense than trump in that speech
and to think that he is the president of our wonderful country
it is a clear evidence that trump is running the show in order to avoid/delay muller investigation prosecution
how many days will trump be able to run the show with border wall national emergency government shut down etc before orange jump suit
how much will all of this going to court etc etc for the wall cost the tax payers in the end
i live in illinois and i do not give a rats ass about the wall
he likes abc a little more than nbc
haha
oh good trump can get his re-election trophy to display to his followers so he can stay in office and destroy this country more
if you have soo much money why is the government taking soo much from is tax payers
amazing negotiator
america better like getting buggered 'cause they 're getting it now and it 'll get worse
he 's a great tactician
trump says i dont really need to build the wall now but i just want to get it done quickly
well is n't he just undercutting his claim that it 's an emergency lol
trump really needs that owes puttin 4 the emails he asked 4 remember
get ready for american psycho 3
sets a nice precedent anytime a president ca n't get legislation he can declare a national emergency write an executive order the imperial president
i have come up with so many lies i think i will contact the guinness people because i think it ‚Äô s a world record
the corporate elite could n't resist cheap slave labor and thus why it has gone on for so long
we as americans have the right to know who is entering our country
my own family went through ellis island where they were mandated to have paper work and often times were quarentined
it blows my mind how far we as a nation have devolved
really
they elected trump because he was suppose to be the great negotiator fixer
lmao
here ‚Äô s more like a wedge
the longer i listen to him speak the more brain cells i lose
i wonder..is there like some silver windup key in 45 's back where someone walks him to the podium stands behind him cranks this key turns it and he starts spewing the same folderol bull-hockey from last time a really big wall needed for a safe america yada yada drugs pouring across the border yada..trafficking duct tape on their mouths democrats and obama did this yada..yada
he does not care if it passed or not he just wants to say he tried but he lied mexico did not pay neither will we say our country is still here with no wall and most
he would be out on his arse in 5 minutes in a true democracy
way to go great prezüëçüëç
is there really a crowd watching this
üòÇ it ‚Äô s funny when trump gets risky questions
more ramblings of a fruitcake unfuxkingbelieveableü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™
this is good
the next democratic president will declare guns a national emergency and ban them completely
thanks trump
democraps cry more
i can almost guarantee that almost no military leader told him the wall is needed
this was easily the most incoherent disjointed rant that i have heard from any head of state from any nation
i feel like he 's paying back the billions he owes cus in the 90 i believe he said he was billions in the hole on roseanne 's talk show we will not live in a democracy soon now i 'm also starting to think it was something with the presidential emergency alerts we all were receiving to our phones and before that hawaii had an emergency alert saying there was a inbound missile coming their way to take cover something is n't right and when the s hits the fan it wo n't be good
his wife says be best
stop bullying lol lol like donald the free press
cnn y'all cause this man to win
i really don ‚Äô t hope there was a speech writer behind this more to the point why was there no speech writer for this

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Synagogue shooting

yeah but why did you barely cover the sri lanka bombings
love from pakistan
do n't let a good tragedy go to waste
right
they love it
i like how cnn leaves out that a off duty border patrol engaged the shooter first
glad to see them strict gun laws are working just fine in commiefornia
thank god that border patrol agent shot him before he could hurt more people
i really do n't know why i care anymore
it 'll be a pyrrhic victory at best
i love how you reported the rabbi got his fingers blown off better make sure you know what you ‚Äô re talking about before he reported he got shot in the hand
im from sd poway is such a calm rich friendly area alot of elderly
california has the most strict gun control in the nation already
we need more people with discipline to start carrying
new zealand sri lanka now the us and all through history are in the spot light
we must remember this cliche victims who shoot back live longer
i 'm sure there were some very fine people on both sides
lol
quick
put up more of those anti-gun signs and restrict gun owners further if that 's possible because it clearly works
captain america grows old and retires
good job reporting this story 2 hours late
from the words of the great hillary clinton there was only 1 killed what does it matter
today was a good day for cnn
big media is big gay
um quick question can someone tell me how this is trumps fault and why
new zealand srilanka and now usa
a country full of guns
gun control is making is worse the more the goverment infringes the right to bare arms the worse it will get
its ok there is good people on both sides trump
omg more mk ultra
more forreskins for moloch
that is exactly how most republicans think
go to 0:45 in the video and look at the panel to the right of the guys shoulder
at least these lunatics are switching scenarios from schools to churches no that it is good either for sure
we better learn to stand up and stop all of this violence it is up to us
there were good people on both sides
good people on both sides of the barrel
very fine people in both sides
we pray and pray and the criminals keep winning
cnn tells partial truths only and those that their monetary bosses like the most
america the best country on earth
land of the free and home if the brave
pain is pain you can become stronger for it but it 's not necessary even better without it if you want everything and all power pain gone matters that 's why i always preach comfortability to emerge always truly honestly
lmao oh wait it does n't fit the narrative
minimal casualties i think it was a success considering
many more could have died
even though i 'm athirst i send my best and my condolences for the victims who were injured and though who lost there life
ladies if they are sister if not if wife just they know love nothing else
leave the innocent alone
like it really is n't but some people said it was really pisses me off
with all else this is the top story
not a hate crime but terrorism
no sane person hunts innocent people just sayin
love my jewish brothers and sisters
all place ‚Äô s of workship should be guarded by law enforcement
seeing this is just a major facepalm
surprised this is not happening more often
you push the envelope with anti-white hatred you 're gon na have some unstable white nationalist strapped ready to roll
is n't life under trump and his peachy fans gotten so much smoother and peaceful since 2016
so much better
with the wonderful improvements in
i went to college in san diego and poway was one of my favorite cities because it had less traffic and it had a smalltown vibe
i got my car tuned up at the local toyota dealership and they even gave me a free can of sanitation wipes that had a 25 off coupon if i returned it empty
sending love from the philippines
go to x22report on you tube for some more of the truth
we need more of a deterrent for these types of crimes
they go straight from the court room to death row and the sentence is carried out within 30 days
i also would like to see them hanged by their packages for 24 hours right before execution but probably wo n't get that
i thought criminals obeyed laws once they were in place my mind is completely blown by the fact that ca gun laws are n't ending shootings
my love and prayers for you all such a tragedy
oh my god i live in poway
man i used to live near there
the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
christian terrorism will become more and more common as rightwing populist parties gain power
sending love and hope and prayers to california ‚ù§Ô∏è
this is a result of the left allowing jew haters into our own goverment the enemy within
the rich are not good to the rich
leave it to the clinton news network to cover something that most likely a ff
right next to my house i heard the shots‚Ä¶
let 's see if it 's so easy for you to practice what you preach
that man who did the shooting is the best man ever
good job to the police for quickly apprehending the suspect
i say this to all people of all races and religious beliefs stay safe loved and protected
looks like somebody did something thanks ilhan
i think trump is calling quits on the make america great again everything just got worse
i send my condolences to the loved ones of the deceased
guaranteed if the off-duty officer had n't been there more people would have died
so many terrorist attacks man
its like its happening everywhere in america now almost every day it 's a new shooting
prayers to the loved ones of the deceased and injured as well üôèüôèüôè heavenlyfather hearusüïäüî•üî•üî•üïä
the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun off course cnn is not going to inform you that an off-duty border patrol agent with a gun confronted the shooter
i love the religion of peace
a good guy with a gun
i am a christian and am devastated by this heinous crime against our wonderful jewish community
poway is a peaceful
this is a prime example of a good guy with a gun stopping a bad guy with a gun
this scenario may have been much worse there would have been no opposition to the shooter hooray for the good guys
i live here and my friends dad died and my friends friend got shot
how many were shot and killed in chicago today
75 of young americans live in fear of a mass shooting taking place
man i hope these passover worshippers are getting better
god bless and stay strong
stop making these killers relevant
it 's not a weekend in america without a major shooting anymore
the attacker used an ar-15 which is banned in california and attacked them in a gun free zone
ok it 's cnn dumbing down the world
my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the deceased and injured
üò©üò©üò©üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ really america
perhaps good people should carry firearms to protect themselves and others
looks like all that gun control stopped him lol now go pass more laws that criminals will ignore
i bet the shooter is proud to be a deplorable
there were good people on both sides should haunt america forever
why are there even manipulators in the world let alone people who do these things maybe the man who did this did n't have something in his heart of love to guide his instincts in life about these things something specific like a person maybe someone to talk to him to listen like i always happen to say about shooters if he had someone to at least listen to him maybe he would n't be into these things of what he did someone in his heart or something someone powerfully in him and dear to him as a good influence too not just anyone i suppose to listen to in his heart as someone to listen to for instinctual guidance so bad how this happened
why can ‚Äô t the world be peaceful
1 jew gets more coverage than 300 christians
what ‚Äô s up with you right wing extremists
i ‚Äô m conservative and this is a bit much
hmmm funny
i grew up with guns i know how guns work and how to respect them my dad told me and my brother and sister guns are not toys or not something to play with so this what he told us do n't blame the gun blame the person who has the gun god bless all of you my prayers are with california right now
if the suspect did literally have full motive of doing it in terrorist fashion does n't mean straping a bomb to you and running a building
call it a terrorist action
wow
wow another shooting
what 's new
barr wrote ‚Äú the special counsel ‚Äô s investigation did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 u.s presidential election
although the investigation established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities ‚Äù notes on the mueller report a reading diary by benjamin wittes
call your congressperson demand his silence he is completely off the rails
but who would report their deaths haha
the rabbi put up a defensive move with his hand not sure if it was his right hand or left hand but i can tell you for sure it was a hand
a bullet ripped through two of his fingers possibility losing his index finger also referred to as the forefinger first finger pointer finger and trigger finger
here 's something for the anti gun enthusiast everyone who owns guns should have their trigger finger removed this should cut down on gun assaults in california for sure
lol great job cnn
pay attention to how much coverage this gets and how it 's framed and then remember how they cover churches that this happens in on a daily basis
we are the world we the children we are the ones to make a better day so less stop killing what happened to live and let live
you wo n't understand it anyways even unless you go to zion the true church
is the shooter one of those very fine people like the neo-nazis who held a tiki-torch parade in charlottesville while shouting anti-jewish chants
clearly something is fuelling it
it 's ironic that the us should accuse other countries of being state sponsors of terrorism
and does so little to address these acts within it 's own borders
the passover which occurred 7 days ago is observed for 1 day only the following day begins the high shabbat of the feast of unleavened bread which runs for 7 days
they want to fast track laws that favor jews
mark my words their will be more to help push their communist agenda
once the guns are gone so will the first amendment then the forth
this is what the democratic socialist party wants for you nation
guess those gun free zone signs in california are gon na have to be made 4ft taller and a few inches thicker huh
trump good people on both sides
it does n't matter if guns become illegal mass shooting/killings will still happen unless we focus on the real problem the shooters/human beings
i am more interested in finding out who was influencing bullied/abused and corrupted him
thank you for reading my comment my fellow human being who is tired of this too
isis must be proud americans doing the work for them
i hold him and the republican party responsible for this environment we 're now living in
he has repeatedly encouraged this kind of violence by his response to these kinds of events
he 's a phony and most of all he 'll put up anything for his position
the next time he opens up his mouth encouraging this kind of s he should be sanctioned and impeached
it 's not hard to determine that
my prayers and thoughts are with the innocent victims their families and friends
sounds right with the situation üëøüôä devilswork
people who go to temples are peaceful individual 's why are they being targeted
why do so many people hate jews but love japanese
it could well be one of the fine people that trump believes are in the neo nazi movement
lol why am i not surprised
how many more attacks and shootings on religious groups and people will we see this year
time for a positive change ‚ù§
what shooting is not a hate crime
assault rifles are banned in california therefor this story ca n't possibly be true
honestly
this guys name is john earnest he posted a 4,000 word manifesto online and live streamed this to 8chan
how come nearly all of these mass shooters get taken into custody
islam is peace really
these demonrats in office need to abolish their plans in creating gun free zones and disarming innocent people from defending themselves in tragic events such as a mass shooting
meh like 25 times this many people were shot in just the first two months of just this year just in chicago
but for some reason none of those were worthy of cnn 's top coverage
oh right because jews
cnn will drop this story like a hot potato because the shooter was a never trumper
it 's super scarry kamala harris and bernie sanders would let a person like this to still have the right to vote
that says a whole lot about them and who they are
they are peaceful when we got muslim and somali issues could have went after them
america definitely the safest country to live eh
it 's a tv shaman and a big liar a divorced man is a sexually explicit grand gambler and a real racist
it 's a tv shaman and a big liar a divorced man is a sexually explicit grand gambler and a real racist
nine billion people on this little rock people are loosing their minds more every day
it is now doubly important for the democratic party to get a handle on some of the rhetoric coming out in recent days from their ranks
saying jews are like cockroaches or that they control the finances of the country in a nefarious way these are old antisemitic tropes that have no place in politics
i hope the right people get the message
did n't trump say the jews will not replace us people are fine people yesterday
there will be more of these
just reading most of these comments you can see that the majority of the worlds mentalities are just what they are prophesied to be in these times
revelation 2:9 jeremiah 14:2 these are synagogues of satan filled with imposter jews-the real jews according to the bible are black
i like to imagine a world where people could live together in peace
i can do my thing and you can do yours im not so sure if it 's possible anymore
quick
as a jew i am for the right to bear arms and this is what happens when you arent prepared
i go to chabad etc and normal people would have extra security details etc especially on high holidays
there is nothing funny about this situation
sounds like the copy-cats are starting and no one is safe what 's next
guns are so pathetically easy to get
we need more cow bell gun control
you would think with all those gun laws they would n't be able to commit an attack like such
problem is not enough guns in good citizens hands
im sure this very fine people got the inspiration from maga chief üòè
he must be one of those fine people trump was telling us about
yall panic to much
you need to stay clear headed and actually use your brains instead of acting like all you got for a brain is a big hole in your head
best you can do is take note of the situation and let the professionals handle it
its just entertainment to watch these things happen to all of you at this point it isnt healthy for all yall to be indulging yourself so heavily on whats going on in the world negative wise
for one their is more important things to worry about like protecting our own and it also just will make you a person who is no fun to hang out with not to mention crazy
sometimes its better to loose track of whats going on around the world and just forget rather than push your emotional limits every day
at least religious people believes their gods fixes everything from before anything begins like forever or something truly and honestly i do n't know jewish religions though something commendable i would think a good standard to want for the world
demos do n't really care
white terror has killed more people than anyone else
why can ‚Äô t our country look up to new zealand
why didn ‚Äô t your government do something after new zealand
the media will give this far more attenion then it ever gave to the 380 easter worshippers that died in siri lanka
i 'm surprised cnn even reported this since it was an attack on jews
trump will be like well there were good people on both sides
there were very fine people on both sides of the shooting
stop giving these people a name this story probably already has over a billion views with the combined videos and media stations everywhere he is famous for doing what he did and it is the media ‚Äô s fault like what are you guys doing as the media
this world is turning into a despicable place to live this country and the world needs to start focusing on mental health issues
there needs to be free facilities that cater to individuals who are challenged mentally
when innocent people have to worry about going to worship any where this is an epidemic here and other countries
we had a free facility here in washington d.c.called saint elizabeth hospital that was shut down during the reagan adminstration
i believe he closed most of these places to trim the budget at that time
we as tax payers need to press our government on this problem until they do something concrete about it
free palestine
i 'm not saying this person wants to be jewish but he sees something within that community he strives for but ca n't seem to acquire
but his actions today makes him feel more excluded from the actual thing he wishes to be connected to
in other words he is living an ironic hell that will forever repeat itself
he might be a christian and therefore a very fine person
good start lads
let me guess more gun laws
happen in a gun free zone in a restricted gun state
the world will be a better place without religion
same old
same old thoughts and prayers
same old pro-gun arseholes saying people kill people
same old argument about the right to bare arms 300 years ago
same old nothing
same old people dying for nothing
good luck
we need to do something more about this
better gun laws
better law enforcement
why is this more important to cnn then the 300 dead in sri lanka
i dont get why this is such a huge deal to everyone
first a mosque then a church and now a synagogue
ilhan omar and rashida tlaib are having a very good year
much to celebrate
this is why we need more good guys with guns
he literally tell them them that it 's ok
they are very fine people
hunters have more sense on their own
cnn is the true enemy of the american people
if it was n't for people like the ones that work at cnn and msnbc this country would be peaceful
these straight white males must be eliminated because they do n't realize that diversity is their strength
makes perfect sense when comparing 22 cases of measles can that generate mandatory vaccinations for everyone
love live men
ilhan omar and rashida tlaib are having a very good year
much to celebrate
no single religion culture or race has all the answers
we need to bring back public executions and public torture for these kind of crimes
this is becoming a normal part of american society
trump and the news need to start educating people about that fact that statistics show that most acts of terrorism that occur in america are perpetrated by white american men america needs to come to terms with these problems and then the country can start to heal
well this is all the more reason to ban all guns
how many times already this year but they love to talk about black on black crime
yea ok
it 's expressed in these shootings and it 's also expressed right here on this page
there are many forms of violence
many degrees of violence
right here you will see verbal violence immediately
we are absolutely coming apart
i consider the united states to be entering a state of mass psychopathy and except for certain pockets of unusual health and moral consensus points on a map that hold concentrations of strangely civilized people the culture at large is becoming objectively a dangerous environment for human beings
i realize that crime rates are apparently not that high overall but i 'm not talking about that
how is the most strictest gun control laws doing in my california
better to be armed than sacrificed by some lunatic
this is becoming a normal part of american society
trump and the news need to start educating people about that fact that statistics show that most acts of terrorism that occur in america are perpetrated by white american men america needs to come to terms with these problems and then the country can start to heal
us presidents have always led the free world with peace not anymore with trump
we strike again
the chosen looking to outdo everyone else 's mass shootings if only because they 're supposed to be the most important newsworthy victims
lol kto znaet russki v amerike
even our most sacred sites are not being respected god almighty provide wisdom to our leaders and citizen 's to overcome these tormentous times prayers go to all those affected
absolute madman
first a mosque then a church and now a synagogue
yet another one of trump ‚Äô s ‚Äò very fine people ‚Äô killing innocent people
first comment
i 'm livin like larry but these people sure ai n't
it 's easy if you try
muslims time is coming to endü§£ wait there will be more lol
i suppose trump believes that the killer was a very fine person
as a wise man once said there 's fine people on both sides
all of this violence thanks to the racist in the white house
this not big enough to classify as big as new zealand or sir lanka
2 timothy 3:2 paul says that perilous times would come and the love of many would grow cold
come to the prince of peace not the peace the world offers only the peace that christ can give
for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby you must be saved
it has come to the point that i do n't know what to think of this cnn makes stories up and most hate-crimes are hoaxes
more nra victims
black dude looks way too happy reporting this
welcome to the trump effect
goddangit why do these guys always have to destroy my kind
thanks trump
sound about white
i 'm sure the shooter was a very fine person
right
everybody who is able should carry a weapon nowadays
there were good people on both sides puppet
it 's a tv shaman and a big liar a divorced man is a sexually explicit grand gambler and a real racist
white people back at it again lol üòÇü§£
reasonable question to ask when so many planning terrorist attacks so far have been trump supporters and he gets such support from the far right
let ‚Äô s make more gun laws even more stricter and ban more guns
obey the new laws we shall give you people like law abiding citizens of the united states of america
breaking just in fresh off of the wire no one cares
tramp is a great fool
tramp is a great fool
nothing new here
wow
i ca n't believe what i just watched cnn actually report the known facts without any biased spin pushing their own agendas
leftists and moslem politicians nazis are 100 responsible for the surge in anti semitism‚Ä¶worldwide
everyone like let 's make this the most liked comment
trump has really gotten to america it 's ridiculous how they are getting away with terrorist crimes but not called a terrorist how many more churches in this world has to go down this month this is crazy
jesus 's method of execution and the fact that had a rapidly growing following who saw him as 'king points straight to the romans

well well her beloved father gave a note of congratulation with swallowed pride and wish them grace which he did not show towards the daughter not to mention for the queen or the royal family honour and he indeed showed lack side of it towards his beloved daughter and duty indeed as a father he did not showed an honour of that side when blubber mouthed all over the paper that pays him sad to say old man good y have a big mouthed daughter go and embrace her and your other grandchildren and show them your love this grandson wo n't your love nor your advice
so she had a baby stop localizing these people theres nothing special about it
it ‚Äô s absolutely a lie that the brits love her lying to the cameras shame shame
wow if they had a home birth they went back to tradition
i love you
harry married who she loved and wanted william marriage who he loved and wanted and now we await the future of the kids and their personality and what type of princesses a prince a duke the kids will be no one knows the title of the baby yet and if the baby will have a title so i just ca n't wait to see the personalities of the children what they going to be like because harry is rambunctious megan is outspoken so i translate the personality of children might come right out in the kids so your mother always says do n't wish for what will happen your kids will end up just like you
love this couple
love and congrats from the usaüá±üá∑üíê‚ù§‚ù§üíãüë£üëëüíè

hopefully they will be a happy family
something his mother and father weren ‚Äô t able to do because of the camilla ‚Äú third wheel ‚Äù charles valued over all else

i think the burden is over for him and all those who felt responsible for him his brother felt a deep sense of burden and responsibilities looking after him feeling bad he should be the big brother and you should listen to him so when harry does little mischievous antics he feels shame for his brother and he feels disappointed but now how he is a grown man he 's married i 'm a little bit of the attention is still on harry because now harry has married an american he is married mixed race and he has married quickly and now this baby has taken its wonderful time which i believe it is a home birth because usually takes that long for home birth and the baby is taking the tension so you know there 's a lot of envy on his big brother side but at the same time i know his big brother 's probably happy for him but how he has handled it 's in a much different way i am happy for her and and duchess meghan i am happy for them she 's a strong independent woman and he needs that balance now it 's time for the big brother to find his footing and his own journey his personality now needs to come out because i signed william is a bitch pull back when it comes to his personality so he needs to find his own footing and i wish them the best and i am happy baby sussex is here it 's a boy it 's a boy it 's a boy
we shouldnt even have kings queens or princes anymore come on folks those days are over lol
they had a healthy baby boy on their terms
harry looks exactly as james hewitt i am sure the baby will something like harry
welcome baby sussex
i love you meaghy prince harry and baby sussex
peace and love from mayotte in the indian ocean
a man like harry who showers his wife and child with so much love especially at a time like that
if diana was alive mm would not be in the rf
1 more parasite we have to pay for london uk
james hewitt must be cuffed with news of his first grandchild
lets pray the socialist dont try to turn the boy into a girl at 5 years old
glad he 's a taurusüòÉ
he was used by this narcissist meghan for his wealth notoriety and social connections
just look how she hooked him with the quick pregnancy anchor baby
and mama sussex has brought a big joy to the whole africa continent we love you meghan as our sister and harry as our in-law
that baby is a mix breed human and reptilian but he can still shapeshift ya 'll mugs better get woke like me and open up that third eye
not surprising that the welfare of the elites is important to cnn enemy of the people

noble or royal titles are not recognized within the american federal republic
megan is actually a man and this isn ‚Äô t a real baby
believe me you do n't feel successful until you get married and make a family‚ù§
positive eugenics at it 's finest
congratulations to the new parents
i 'll never understand why americans care so much
once again we the british taxpayers will have to pay for this royal inbred the sooner we rid of these benefit scroungers the better
the grandfather will be so pleased
please cnn just report on this happy moment and birth for the sussex 's üòç
why is this kid special

Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
such a shame the important thing i suppose is it does n't seem that anyone has been hurt in this
a cultural historic place gone
okay folks the church of the world is set on fire during holy week they said they found no signs of arson mmmmmmm
absolute heart ache
so much history just got burnt to the ground
very sad i myself have been to this beautiful church
media is fast blaming it on a renovation accident meanwhile alot of churches in france has been vandalized ü§î
love from the usa
i 'm just glad it did n't burn the whole cathedral but still what a loss of an iconic structure
love to france from the philippines
notre dame is just as if not more iconic than the eiffel tower
beautiful architecture shame it fell
with love from üá©üá™
a representation of some of humanities greatest accomplishments
i experienced one of the highlights of my lifetime there when an american choir who recorded a hym with special permission from the priesthood in this cathedral
the harmony of the song with the acoustic of the cathedral was fantastic
disney 's live-actions remake game strong bruh

wow what the hell
time goes by so fast
0:45-0:48 lol that guy tho
such a beautiful building
the anchor looks more like angela from the office
i never thought that i could be thrilled and amazed by a building
nothing can be the exact same when it is rebuilt
you will need god in times to come more than ever
let ‚Äô s hope that most of what was lost can be restored and what what can ‚Äô t be restored and what can ‚Äô t be restored has been photographed or digitally archived
it is a tragic cultural religious and historic loss but we will be able to rebuild large amounts of it
glad to know that all the relics and treasures were moved away prior to renovations
the clip is 5 years old
exciting good newsÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅpeople spoke of the parthenon in greece the pyramids in egypt the coliseum in rome notre-dame in paris the summer palace in the orient.one day two bandits entered the summer palace.one plundered the other burnedvictory can be a thieving woman or so it seems
the devastation of the summer palace was accomplished by the two victors acting jointly.before history one of the two bandits will be called france the other will be called england
this was one of the few places in life i actually wanted to travel to just because it ‚Äô s so amazing and beautiful my prayers go out to the people of france stay safe everyone
love from greece üá¨üá∑‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáµ
it 's so sad that a structure that historic and beautiful is breaking because of the firesüò≠üò≠üò¢üò¢
i ‚Äô ve been there before it ‚Äô s amazing üò≠üò≠üò¢why
the ashes raining upon paris from the wood of the cathedral are more than 600 years old think about that
my favorite disney movie is the hunchback of notre dame
then right after that i screamed quasimodo no
one of the greatest works of christian and european culture ever constructed
absolutely heartbreaking to see
i lived in paris for a year and i can only offer my sincere condolences to the french people and to parisians in particular
st paul 's cathedral is a symbol of the entire british nation and a symbol of our great city
france will rebuild its magnificent cathedral
paris fire department has super power
1:35 real footage of wtc 1 and wtc 2 fire circa 2001 colored

1163 was christ alive
notre d 's black madonna is really souless sophia who created souless yahweh
the huge embarrassment to france is gone
so sad was there summer 2017 and saw this magnificent piece of history
i remember being there in 2017 on holiday it was so beautiful love and support from the netherlands ‚ô°
i wish these cnn reporters would speak in a more calm and informative tone
bbc seem to have it right
i am absolutely devastated
such a magnificent piece of culture the very best of gothic cathedrals burning to the ground i 'm in tears
today will also be marked in history thank god no one died

love from portugal 3
it does n't matter if you 're religious or not that cathedral was of great cultural and historical significance and it was a symbol of france

so many people with blindfolds on who will never see the truth
isn ‚Äô t this exactly what happened in ‚Äú the hunchback of norte dame ‚Äù
originally built in the 1100 ‚Äô s this is going to be quite a loss
1:06 look at the guy in the right
remember old summer palace now
shaggy did this for sure
i really hope no one died‚ù§Ô∏è
what does it matter a dream of love or a dream of lies
i ‚Äô m really concerned about the people

the world lost so much today
love for paris from the states
new world order leftists islam this
i do n't understand why cnn wants to blame and pin this on president donald j trump.üò©üò¨üòÅüòÉüòÑüòÑüòÑ
an accident yea right
here 's something cnn does n't tell you look it up for yourself how many churches have been burned in the past 4 years in france
how many desacrated
how many compared to the previous 4 years
when did the migrants become welcome to france
know what side your on before your own heads are taken
1:02 laugh
absolutely heartbreaking
cnn yall have n't ran a story on how trump is responsible for this i 'm sure it 's coming but for now i 'm proud of yall
sending love and big respect from indonesia for france üôè
feels very 911 that white smoke
this is funny
riots civil unrest fires and now one of the most beautiful buildings gone paris has really had a bad year i hope the city can recover from all of this
how can they be so sure it is not terror as i heard on one media source
i remember my first visit there it is an amazing structure and this is indeed a great loss
i send my prayers out to france as i pray that france can rebuild and that the crown of thorns is ok
so when my house burnt down an my insurance somehow wasnt kickin in noone helped me not a hand a shoulder to cry on or a dime donations are coming in to replace the structure what im hearing is a structure is more important than human life
1:08 guy wearing clouts hits an old meme
top fire disasters
how did it burn up so quick
this is one of the most historical monuments on earth
so it is written that you can not serve two masters which may be the very reason the lord allowed its part destruction
they will build a greater spire now
an amazing structure has been destroyed
800 years couldn ‚Äô t you give us more
this is unbelieveble a history burned incredible i shocked at night
love from mexico
i have very nice memories from notre dame when i visited paris
i remember seeing this beautiful cathedral many years ago
i am so sorry that this has happened to this wonderful piece of art and history
pet goat 2 revels the truth of the fire amen just watch naughty beavers channel you will get the real truth of whats to come welcome to the real world all planned
macron said on tv that he is asking the eu 27 states to contribute to the restoration of the hunchback better than before he said so why not employ all the craftsmen from the 27 states that way the investment is more than money it 's people power for the union just saying
kind of pitiful but really remind of the unparrelled palaces you invaders burnt up in china in 19th century.what about you guys
what an incredible shame its stood for 850 years do n't believe what i am seeing
the famous notre dame is no more i guess
great footage
my husband has an wonderful idea how to put out fires
dropping 2500 pound bags of water like a water ballons on huge fires
old building done its time.termites got at it
we are very happy to see this fire accident üòÄ voices from china
yea right
im not religous at all im actually a nihilist but this depresses me to see so much history gone at the blink of an eye
surely 2019 has better standards and technology and more money than 1345 right
lefties are happy but to humble to show it
such a lovely old place
i do hope they can put the fire out quickly and safely
i just see wow it 's interesting no any sorrow or criyng at all
where 's ladybug cat noir when you really need them
for whole ‚Äú civilized ‚Äù world it 's a real tragedy
but how this ‚Äú civilized ‚Äù world react to a requiem concert in destroyed palmyra
now i will never see the beautiful building
lol as if paris could n't get anymore messed up
i teared up at the site of one of the most iconic historical cathedral with almost 1000 years of history behind
i will never see that beautiful monument the same
this is a test from god testing if we still love and have complete faith in him
reach up high and pray with all your might
that is good it 's getting rebuilt although it 's gon na take a 5-year renovation v
i just think we should all have hope for this amazing piece of history
let 's remeber that the whole thing is n't gone thankfully
anyone have a hunch this might be more of the same
why so many people is happy to see this piece of art burning up
beautiful monument crumbled into ashes feeling sad for parisans
my family had beautiful memories posing in front of the church 2 years back
paris 10 happiness
it hurts to see all that history destroyed and to see such an incredible building destroyed
the inside was incredible with the glass windows and all of that is lost
no problem they 'll now hire the outfit that does stucco for walmart and modernize the old heap
‚Äú love is like a tree it grows by itself roots itself deeply in our being and continues to flourish over a heart in ruin
it is never stronger than when it is completely unreasonable ‚Äù
ca n't believe that such a storied impressive landmark can be destroyed in almost an instant
we should all respect the brave fire fighters who selflessly battled this destructive force.üá¨üáßüá´üá∑
i 'm not crying
such a beautiful building all gone
so so sad but good that no lives have been lost
making it burn like hell hopping it was an accident and not else more a sad event for humanity what a great loss for the man kind
parisian muslims looking to build a mosque its free real estate
are they surprised it didnt collapse
i guess we now know what ninja really did in europe
happy holy week
remember to say your prayers be kind and be careful
such a great loss to the world and more so to the french people
the firefighters have saved it from the fire and the insides did n't burn this is incredible
god want us be the the church that can share love to others have relationship with the father in heaven not primarily the buildings
which is the most likely answer
it ‚Äô s good it burned down before it would be turned into a mosque
thanks obama
and commie cnn and their beloved marxistglobalist cronies had nothing to do with this of course
still lucky
wow
its clearly the fall of christianity in france indicated by lord jesus himself
please fill the people of paris with your love compassion hope the holy ghost this easter üòç
whoever is responsible for that fire must be feeling pretty shitty right now
seriously not kidding
glad we saw the whole cathedral before the fire
those whistles sound like saint denied in red dead redemption
this is great for france so much publicity so much money pledged and so much compassion from everyone greatest thing that happen to france for the past years
hope they build a mosque on top of the burnt church
very symbolic could be some kind of a sign for some history incoming event
glad it wasn ‚Äô t sacr√© c≈ìur
every heritage site in the world always needs to be on high alert
the crown of thorns..how do we know these relics are even real
i love paris
it is sad and astonishing
when all the citizens work together devotedly with the aim of building a better country everything goes smoothly
on the contrary when people fight and protest against everything that government does the whole country will be just like a chaos waiting for endless accidents and incidents
it 's more like 'hrrrrrrrrr
this is a true loss to all of us
y'all better not blame trump for this
this sad this beautiful church went down
so close for good friday and easter sunday and this happen
my prayers goes out to paris and this amazing church gone
i hope they well built a new one
never give up history always built new
but it is not fake refugees doing this
yeah right see other peoples views
dingle dooley april 2019 the fact that officials were calling it an accident before the fire was out and the long string of desicrated churches throughout europe following the migration crisis certainly looks suspicious
the good news in all this is that no one died in this fire while wood and stone can be replaced and even improved despite the haters
hopefully the future roof will be made if possible of non-flammable material like steel and aluminum beams including the spire and like a phoenix rising from its ashes maybe this old cathedral could become better than ever as a model for environment friendly clean energy with new generation solar panels roofing like a shining beacon on the whole world
the spire collapsed sure
the stained glass is gone sure
i believe that isis or the yellow vests if not both are responsible for this inferno
thank you so much for your support
it goes right to my heart
i 'm in paris right now i 'm frensh and i 'm glad to see people supporting paris like this üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
i feel like there 's probably going to be so many dead bodies they 'll find considering the size
i 'm brazilian and i heard about the news as well as many others around the world
it is already the 8th accident that happens in europe and many more accidents come
i ‚Äô m just surprised that cnn actually has a correspondent in paris
the french are tearing down the old and will put up a new structure
it was so beautiful
when people work together they can create something as beautiful as the cathedral it took such a long time to create
iconic history burnt to the ground
so so typical burning the historical church to distract the whole world from the crime of intentionally burning alaqsa mosque in palestine located inside the occupied area by israel
the whole world will never forgive you for that
i went to notre dame around a year ago and i was in awe at how beautiful this cathedral was and was just amazed at how well it stood after 850 years
two robbers entered the old summer palace
it can be said that victory is the thief 's victory the two winners together completely destroyed the yuanmingyuan
wow they fought against a fire
unfortunatelyÔºåhistorical artifacts are greatÔºåi hope that you can rebuild this great buildingÔºåfrom chinaÔºåif there is a rebuilding donation i will definitely donate 1,000 euros even though i am only a student
very upsetting for france üá´üá∑üá¨üáß
so if god is willing to allow his building to be destroyed how much more the buildings of man
most beautiful church i always visit for prayer when i am in paris
this is a great loss for the whole world and all catholic christians in the world
right after palm sunday
maybe god does n't love themüòë
why did the authorities rush to declare the fire as an accident before the fire was stopped before investigating this incredible tragedy
knowing this why did n't the authorities plann in advance and use adequate fire fighting measures as helicopters or water bombarding planes especially when they had a huge water source near the cathedral
my soul is mourning the destruction of this religious and historical icon of the world but the important questions must be answered
but the real question is how did it catch on fire
hope everyone is ok hope we become united someday and live in a peaceful world again
poor reporting cnn do a better job
merci de transmettre ce message au plus grand nombre de juifs possible afin qu'ils comprennent la grandeur du moment
good üëçüòé
reminds me of the scene from name of the rose film where an imposing gothic structure of medieval western christendom burns with all the priceless manuscripts inside a wealth of knowledge lost to the world for ever
also that firefighters we 're onscene early
there is no excuse for any issues related to water supply or tactical operations
you had centuries to make a detailed operational plan
fine there still should have been countless contingency plans for operating at this historic cathedral and containing the fire to it 's original area and protecting the rest of it
a true tradgedy
iconic churches hospitals schools and care facilities
lives are on the line theirs and ours thanks and god bless the first responders
buddha is the real god
humanoids and by the way if one of your family or you got for expample cancer or something else then at that time pray to your atheist entity or read some anarchist book to feel better
till then keep fly that high but you forgot the story of icarus ŒºœÄœÅŒ±Œ≤Œø Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉœÑŒø œÉœáŒøŒªŒπŒø Œ±œÄŒø ŒµŒΩŒ±ŒΩ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒ± œÄŒøœÖ ŒµŒπŒ¥Œ± ŒµŒ¥œâ Œ∫ŒªŒ±œÉŒπŒ∫Œø Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒµŒπŒ¥ŒµœÇ Œ±ŒºŒøœÅœÜœâœÑŒø Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±œÄŒªœÖœÑŒø Œ±œÄŒµŒæœâ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±œÄŒø ŒºŒµœÉŒ±
france does n't respect their own long christian tradition
many churches were destroyed earlier by local authorities
it will be covered up and the usual suspects in the media will continue to lie about the actual cause of the destruction of one of the greatest works of art in the world
lol
i ‚Äô m truly sorry.one of the most beautiful landmarks in the world burnt what ‚Äô s next
cool
sw florida sends its love to the people of france
would n't be surprised if it turns out that one of them fckd up members of the religion of piece deliberately set fire to it
good bye notre dame de paris
i hope the the people are okay
it a well known fact that islamism has infiltrated many aspect of the french underworld
lol yeah like a measly fire is gon na take out the stone church itself
take heart good christians for the crown of thorns has been saved
how much more important is this one single relic than the entire cathedral that housed it
as an american catholic i am sad for the loss of a great french symbol of catholicism throughout the centuries but i feel that the goodwill created by its rebuilding will be a blessing from god
the walls of this cathedral still stand and it will be resurrected in full glory like our christ
happy easter.‚úùÔ∏è
it is a real tragedy this cathedral is so closely connected with history art literature of the world
a real tragedy for all of us
this spire falls normally as opposed to the spire at the wtc ritual
really
like jerry moonbeam brown said get used to it this is the new normal
france is the most atheist nation on earth
this will only be an economic loss a historical loss a new tax
i just googled aviationguide_final_webpdf and there are soooo many copters and planes to drop water
saw that one at the aspen fire near me
and most copters hold 100-400 gallons
funny world
our greatest cathedral gods house stood there for hundreds of years build by our grandfathers by the strength of there backs by hard work and devotion payed with there blood sweat and lives they left it as our heritage and we carried it as our pride as our cultural heritage and history of our great and wonderful achievement to god we loved it as if it where our lady and as a lady she was beautifully decorated from top to bottom for over more than 8 hundred years she stood glancing here beauty over the rooftops in paris people came from far and beyond to admire her she was the pride of the nation of europe of who we were and are i hope that many of our people have n't forgotten that but the government they sure did with there open borders church after church vandalised burned hunderds of them by immigrants this my dearest people is undeniably a deliberate attack by muslim immigrants on france and europe 's sovereignty on our religion its an attack on our selfs and the people of france but we will not fade we stand determined to fight for our land and heritage for our lady who stood in paris we shall make them pay 40times over we will take the fire to them and make them feel our pain our loss we will fight on the landing ground 's we will fight on the beaches in the city 's and in the streets we will fight in the hills and in the air we shall never surrender
prayers sent to those who are very affected by this from a texan catholic
we have a big old past that makes us have a great social system today we love your films or your series but we do n't want your capitalism hard with the weak.unfortunately this privatized state model has been perfected in usa and it is now trying to impose itself on us
it 's far from perfect cause of the same multinationals that govern you we 're in shit
good evening american friends
the 1,000,000,000 dollars that has been donated to the notre dame cathedral could ‚Äô ve been used to clean all of the great pacific garbage patch
so is god saying ok ok now that you 've prayed to me
i will save the church if he were real why would he let his house be burnt in the first place
highly unprofessional accident
stay strong france
hold your heads high and rebuild
watched you trash a good man bernie sanders for writing a book and
bernie probably did a lot of good
afterall clearly he should have known that his suggestion could result in the collapse of the entire structure
like live aid for the cathedral
a muslim temple will take over this is how europe is gon na be in the near future
its not the muslims okay
notre dame cathedral is the most beautiful cathedral in the hole world
france is a big and rich nation
if they ca n't fix the cathedral then they are going to do best for it
best thoughts from croatia
apparently a chinese company needs only 1 or 2 years to restore it without the artistic articles restoration
muslims loved watching this happen
on the bright side maybe some pedophile priests were killed in the fire
i would like to see muslims come and pray with the chirstians just to ease off the tensions like they did in new zealand
why this beautifully cathedral üòøüò≠
the new 9/11
incredible loss for paris and france
i am crying right now üò≠
800 years of history and beautiful architecture gone in the blink of an eye
i do n't know if it was an accident or not but shame on you who are happy with this
beside your beliefs it was a magnificent piece of culture and history not just for christianity but for the world as well
despite your faith any mindful human being must be able to acknowledge the value of monuments like that
cnn doesnt really care they wage war against religion unless it 's islam
very good mashallah now we muslims can build a mega masjid now inshallah
even where i live here in canada taxi services were apparently swamped by calls from people going to their local catholic church to pray
it was the most important for paris
i now feel very privileged that i was able to see it when i was in paris a few years ago
they sure are trying hard to put it out with that one hose
it 's just sad to have to lose such an amazing 800 year old structure
this is excellent news macron can finally build the mosque there he always wanted
imagine how many deflowered alter boys are cheering as they watch this
i have a strong feeling this is not over yet
shame i never see the notre dame in real life
inshallah a new mosque will replace this building soon
mohammad pbuh had great respect for jesus
too many other construction projects have burned and these accidents just repeats itself
so much corruption in the catholic religion god ‚Äô s wrath they have more wealth than the whole world put together but don ‚Äô t help anybody
they will replaced it with a mosque to welcome all the new illegal immigrants and growing muslim population in the country
melissa looks like sonja morgan from the real housewives of ny
this is really a tragedy
and most of those are from 12th to 14th century
many of them on unesco world heritage list
suddenly everyone knows about notre dame it will be rebuilt stop freaking out and acting like you care this is actually good for publicity and tourism
when the paris police are knocking and priests need to get rid of their child porn collection haha
prayers from chicago to this beautiful church of god
am still happy they don ‚Äô t charge anyone who visits the church even tho they badly needed money to renovate it
we ‚Äô ll take away your sorrow and sadness for the church ‚õ™Ô∏è and fill it with joy and grace of god again
a teribile day for the humanity probably the most
i genuinely have tears in my eyes
i remember when i was traveling wondering how many future generations would be able to admire the historic sites of the world
the french not only burned china 's yuanmingyuan but also burned their own notre dame
have n't been to church for twelve years i 'm going this sunday to pray for the good will of us all
ah that ‚Äô s hot
wow so big
i can tell you i live near notre dame de paris i was wachting was happene this is not terrorism stop drama it 's ok it 's just acciden and rock who will be replaced no panic
frensh in city they will recovery the cath√©drale it 's acciden like in new york with the liner normandie in 1942 in new york do not dramatize i do not know
it is may be little a sign that it is full of rich
all the love from iraq üáÆüá∂
it took 2 hours for the fire brigades to arrive and the free mason media has already stated no arson is involved
because they are free masons n free masons burnt the church before good friday cause they know millions will be praying at that very church
the statue of mary on the top of the spire is going ‚Äú i ‚Äô m flying jack ‚Äù
well at least it 's not our planet yet but the sooner the better
the tower of an old building burns we 're donating billions to fix'er right up now
i think we all know who is responsible for this
great let 's nuke mecca once and for all
they really want muslims and christians to turn on each other and start fighting
most of the internet people dont know what france is or even where is europe is even if they live in it but those stuck up filfths are so sad about this dd
forget that old ass building
13 during the reigns of louis xiv and louis xv the cathedral underwent numerous alterations to comply with the more classical style of the period
the sanctuary was re-arranged the choir was largely rebuilt in marble and many of the stained glass windows from the 12th and 13th century were removed and replaced with white glass windows to bring more light into the church
a colossal statue of st christopher standing against a pillar near the western entrance and dating from 1413 was destroyed in 1786
during this time many of the treasures of the cathedral were either destroyed or plundered
14 many of the heads were found during a 1977 excavation nearby and are on display at the mus√©e de cluny
15 the cathedral 's great bells escaped being melted down
all of the other large statues on the facade with the exception of the statue of the virgin mary on the portal of the cloister were destroyed
maybe christians should stop valuing stone more than human life and let the media influence their definition of being a christian
thank you to the people responsible for it
most europeans do too
lol
and look at fat she 's so gorgeous
live by die by the g code
so do n't compare how you move to the real
wow this story is becoming really hot
this is clearly the work of the templars or the assassins
islam wins the struggle begins
i will give my sympathy to the people of syria or people who are dying in hunger than this old structure
do n't cry france rebuild it with a silver spire and roof will make it very special mixing old with new will be very interesting more visitors will come believe me
so depressing to see something so magnificent literally turn to ashüò¢
here 's my highly unpopular opinion of the day
good job
watch with sia-flames playing in the background or bloodhound gang-the roof is on fire or better off ellie goolding-burn
i wonder if they heard of nelly 's it 's gettin hot in here scamaway
certainly a plan to shut down the yellow vest movement
here 's a prediction ‚Äì macron will want the re-build to include aspects of islam to reflect the cultural state of france
we can be happy that the complete works of bach and palestrina and dufay are still there
and that people will certainly reflect more about early christianity and threats to other masterpieces of western civilization
new h
maybe christians should stop valuing stone more than human life and let the media influence their definition of being a christian
others have burned and more will burn before jesus returns to earth and sets things straight
very suspicious of this
no way this was due to pure negligence
it look like a grande dame burning on a bucher the oldest dame in the world so sad it was not only religion it was art culture 852 yrs of history the crown of jesus was inside but was safe
love from america oh my god i can ‚Äô t believe this happened
if this is n't proof that god is n't real i do n't know what is
perfectly symbolizing the fall of western civilization

there 's now way the spire could collapse like that normally
the titanic sunk on april 15 president abraham lincoln was assassinated on april 15 the us tax day is also on april 15 lol
muslims around the world can laugh out loud now they must be pretty proud of this
to all of you who truly believe in the words of the good lord know this
although they be a nice token of the history of our religion it is not the material structures and relics of old which define us
our wonderful and most highly ideal religion true and undefiled christianity is in need of an overhaul a revival as such
thanks be to the most high
absolutely unprecedented in modern history outside of war or natural catastrophe
evolution is inevitable old ways of degeneracy must come to an end
why they 're not using helicopters and other new equipments i thought there are newer technologies in our days for fire fighting
this is the new europe and they bought it upon themselves
welcome paristan
this great building has been around for 1000 years
and it is actually real
hey cnn have you enjoyed the financial gain from the orteg intelligence agencies propaganda fund that obama set up for you and msnbc to try to bring down our great president
and cnn why are n't you guys happy that trump is willing to give your sanctuary cities the illegal immigrants you all say are so much better than us americans
ohhh so you want them just not in your cities ok gotcha
is the hunchback ok
such an amazing place destroyed
well burning notre dame the fall of the spire have officially guaranteed france the vatican that they will be super super rich within the next 24 hours
even though i have never been there i have always dreamed of going to see the norte dame to see its true beauty
from america üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ also do you guys think it ‚Äô s a coincidence that on the exact same day a church was burned by a communist
yes it ‚Äô s a beautiful building with history but my goodness it ‚Äô s only a f building yes let it be in news and give it the time it deserves but my goodness you would think twin towers had just happened or the queen had died or
so france thought receiving hundreds of thousands of people from muslim and african countries would be a good idea
first the influx of immigrants and now the cathedral
so glad it burned
the collapse of the cathedral 's iconic spire is the sign of the abandonment of christianity let 's go back brothers before it 's too late
a 800 year old church burns everyone is in tears
this is the great god 's punishment of the english boar
this is the fire of righteousness from our great believers and in a few days we will continue to set fire to the fires of righteousness throughout europe
though this is off topic sunday will be the 20th anniversary of the columbine shootingüò¢i hope that all schools will remain safe next week.ü§ûü§ûüá∫üá∏ hs senior
im happy it burnt down
be strong france
need some water bombers they could hit it multiple times maybe they dont have many forest fires there not sure
omg where tf is the hunchback gon na live
the burning of notre dame is exactly one month after the 15 march 2019 ‚Äò christchurch new zealand mosque massacre ‚Äô ‚Ä¶ and in france which is approximately 10 or slightly more muslim it is quite possible that one or more of the many renovation workers who were in notre dame before the fire were muslim
someone better call the belmonts
jokes aside this really sux
how fitting 4 frances demise
the spire was for aether collecting free energy
danm wish for the best
love from oman
i hope quasimodo is ok
quasimodo ‚Äô s fault honestly
good news quasimodo is staying in a 2 bed hostel in montmatre a bed for him and a bed for his hump
but i can not avoid seeing that there are entrepreneurs who are going to donate many millions of euros for their reconstruction
as my case i work since i was 9 years old
to have my own business
if someone wants to give me help to grow
i 'm not as important as a cathedral
to make it so hot pour the oil tank inside the building
a source of true art ‚ù§
our thoughts go towards paris their people in this time of great mournful loss
seeing this is heartbreaking but it makes me think god sacrificed this beautiful historical symbol of european culture and tradition to remind the french and europeans that you have the most incredible beautiful culture and history of this world
otherwise all of europe 's churches will be burning or turned into mosques if you do not wake up and do so quick
interference putin already wants to send in a team of spies go
i hope everyone stays safe
sending love and prayers üíîüò±üò¢
clearly 13 million visitors per year was not enough to keep him happy
we all have the same suspicions i 'm sure
happy i visited before it caught on fire
the only time that the media has given a true story though mixed the event true but confused over other things
i will build it back with concrete structure fireproof.less wood material only where necessary ring out the old bring in the new
luckily all is not completely lost enough left to restore some things
if u rebuild it its just a copy of the original
i ‚Äô m starting a kickstarter campaign to raise funds to build a new home for quasimodo
nothing interesting
i can feel the french cause the destruction of the old summer palace ‚Äî1860 peace
it 'll be a huge insurance claim
so basically i planned to visit this place paris dame catheral also 1 of the place would visit because i love to learn see history 's stuff
and then suddenly this happen omg seriously is this a joke t^t btw hopefully no one injured stay safe paris citizen
he will take his churches so much sin malice and he knows that the churches are not doing anything
the signs are clear
quick save the alter boys
here in france many happyness reactions of muslims
it was clearly detonated
black metal right there
see as much as you possibly can in this lifetime because irreplaceable works of art can be destroyed in a moment 's notice never to be seen again sometimes with no explanation as to why
wow
stay strong france
rip notredame been there for centuries 13 million tourist every year visit survived so many wars and catastrophes france hundred attacks on on churches lately and no media has reported on those attacks why
aww shiet some hunchbacks are out of a home
you can not be serious unprecedented
hope quasimodo and the gargoyles are ok
such a heartbreaking üíî moment to watch the world famous iconic spire fall and disappear beneath the smoke never to be seen the way it was again
matthew 27:50-51 and jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit
and behold the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
i just heard this was croatians that were responsible over a soccer player does anyone know if thats true
this is not the first time a fire has burned the notre dame cathedral
so many questions needs to be answered
00:47 lmao but really sad
this is sad pray that it is good now
omggggggg i don live there but i ‚Äô ve been to paris before and i got to walk around notre dame üò¢
musliums better pray to allah that a muslium is not found responsible for this
though to be honest dozens of churches have been burned in europe over the last 2 years and no one seems to care
lol they do n't care about the demographic disaster and a criminal prime minister but a spire let 's all hold hands
we can be happy that quite the complete works of bach and palestrina and dufay are still there
and that people will certainly reflect more about early christianity and threats to other masterpieces of western civilization
very soon
i ‚Äô m not a french but i ‚Äô m crying i ‚Äô m too emotional or i don ‚Äô t know but i ‚Äô m really sharing your pain ‚ù§Ô∏è stay strong france üá´üá∑
happy easter
ok
this isn ‚Äô t okay
okay so i ‚Äô m a huge history nerd and i pretty much cried over this beacause it ‚Äô s history
did cnn get this story right or are they adding in their lies again
reminds me of when america and england bombed all the great cities of germany to smithereens along with their innocent women and children and incredible irreplaceable architectural design engineering and art treasures
ironic and fishy got ta be honest
in a time of quite decent peace during holy week this happens to the side of the church
very unimpressed with two things 1
the passive fire prevention devices and procedures that notre dame had a place so valuable artistically culturally and religiously built 800 years ago almost completely with highly flammable materials and visited by thousands of persons every day definitely required better prevention
if water is spayed from the distance straight to the flames it evaporates before even reaching the structures
i visited it roughly 10 years ago a beautiful piece of architecture both inside and out
this is clearly nothing more than a method to keep the protesting french citizens occupied with something else
what better way to keep people off the street than by inducing a form of national mourning
welcome to 1984 folks
if this did n't prove to be islamic terrorism i 'd be very surprised
its sooo beautiful
love from the usa
i never went to paris but i hope y ‚Äô all will be able to preserve some parts of the cathedral
love from the usa üá´üá∑üá´üá∑üá´üá∑üá´üá∑üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üò¢üò¢üò¢
rip good job
miss them outside world with real hot chicks
right after palm sunday the week of easter thats no accident
cnn this is a example of real news
france should immediately fireproof its other iconic cathedral at chartres
superior french artistic skill and technological sophistication will ensure that whatever rises from the ashes will be both breathtaking and fireproof
we lost an 850 year old piece of history that built humanity built by humanity
let 's hope it did n't burn from praying too much
an almost 1000 year old landmark like this is irreplaceable
sad to see such a beautiful historic building burning down
it 's good
yellow vests it 's more than people are thinking of
a set fire wake up world love life empathy is not what you think or feel
no planes to drop water off from the top
i mean so many years this building has gone through and wars and hasn ‚Äô t been damaged and suddenly a fire makes it fall kinda suspicious
look at the most high working setting up for the israelites to be in our rightful place
right after palm sunday
old lady and guardian of paris
this is one huge profound sign of jesus 's return just a taste of what is to come
this is an epic symbol and turning point in the ongoing subjugation of france an d western europe to the insidious invasion of and conquest by the aggressive supremacist islamist imperialist colonialists
saudis will pay to rebuild notre dame as a grand mosque
you do n't see any muslims out helping to put out the fire wonder why invite them in mass into your country and this is the 3rd huge church fire now and ramadan is may 6
yeah get the marshmallows out boys but first save quasimoto
stop reporting real issues and talk about orange man
woohoo some old building caught fire what are about about the thousands of millions of people who have perished away with their families
it ‚Äô s a sad day but the vatican ‚Äô s supposedly worth 30billion or more has assets of 764million 20million in gold reserves
it ‚Äô ll provide many much needed jobs
several completely gutted buildings in the uk have been completely rebuilt so it is completely feasible
this 'has happened in the past to many historic sites which will be restored as new
this was an accident keep the faith strong and spread strength love and reassurance during times of turmoil and times of peace
prayers from new york
such a beautiful building such a sad situation
truly a beautiful building i have no clue how that fire started but it ‚Äô s such a shame
the religion of ‚Äú peace and love ‚Äù behind this for sure
trump 's backers the extreme right sent bannon to rome to attack the pope
6:20 it 's pretty chaotic here
good riddance
fallen fallen is babylon the great
it 's so sad to see such a beautiful city become so crumbling
lets see how quick the vatican is to put their hands in their pocket to help finance the restoration because it can be restored they did a great job on windsor castle
it wo n't work traitors america is too much awakened
however if so they will quickly cover it up
very sadüòû üôàüòî i visited this beautiful cathedral many years ago i hope no injured people there
symbolic of europe really
beautiful building but where 's this god when you need him day off
lol
people are so innocent
it 's a plane it 's a mild mannered aerospace engineer by day masked fire fighter at night
and who cleverly disguised as potus fights a never ending battle for truth justice and cheating on his income taxes
and to think emanual macron wants to rebuild it to 'frances new diverse standard and the mayor of france wants to turn it into a mosque
it was reported that thousands of child molestation was done there and it was targeted many times i am just writing what the news said please do n't blame me
macron a political opponent of trump was too quick to say no that it would make the whole structure collapse
i believe that water certainly would have been better than allowing the fire to destroy this incredible landmark
a huge piece of history has died today
if all the people crying out because this building is burning would cry out against the murders of all the innocent children who will never leave the womb alive i wonder what would happen

i am sure one hurricane after another has nothing to do with global warming also in the same note once miami an ny are under water that is just due to someone in europe leaving the faucet on
he did the same thing during florence lol
lol the government made another hurricane
nice to see the yanks getting hammered again

psa if you need to evacuate and absolutely have no way to take your pets with do not leave your pets in cages
at least let them out of the house so they have a chance of survival animals are smart they know when disasters are coming and will use their own common sense to get to a safe area if they are in a cage and it floods they have a 0 chance of surviving and will drown if no one finds and saves them
please do n't lock your pets up this happens too much
i might not go to school cuz of this and i live in ga
a whole lot worse before it gets better.the new normal
that 's the spirit of michael jackson so the people of florida the usa have some fun üòÆüòàüòÄüòé‚úåüíìüé∂üé∂üåç

good job hurricane
wow üòÆ just wow
what kind of sound stage is he on
100 mph wind is uprooting concrete and steel railings but he can stand easily and the mic sounds fine
this guy actually brought up the red sox winning last night while people lose their homes not your best moment
a life threatening disaster landed and somehow y'all want to relate it to politics rather than direct hearts/love and prayers out to those whose lives are danger
btw if you want to point fingers direct them at the real culprits the elites using haarp to depopulate
im so happy a huricane is named after me
higher than cat5
the end is near we have to pay for our sins
my dad name is michael so yeah lol but still everyone stay safe
i hope it does n't i have off of school because it apparently going to hit us
wow my hometown is getting destroyed

hope it passes fast
tell me again why anyone would want to live in florida
my friends down in there please be safe
my grandma and grandpa go to florida for the winter and i 've been keeping in contact with her to make sure she 's okay
she was in south carolina and she had to go back south because the winds and rain was so strong
i ‚Äô m so sorry i ‚Äô m the one who made the prayer for something huge to happen a week or four ago i just wanted to see if god was real üòîüò≠üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò´üò´üò´
jesus stay safe everyone
these reporters are wild

by 2040 the earth is gon na be too hot for it 's own good a new study proves
i was this live at my school middle school my teacher put it live so we can see it
i ‚Äô m in the path of the hurricane but mine is just rain and no power but to the people who got hit hard i preyed for them ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèbe safe
he is prepared and ready to help with the recovery
quick get out of the fortnite storm
furthermore panama city bore more of the brunt of the storm than did pcbch
be safe
that storm looks 'king kong strong
toppling the gorilla.probably real weather reporting this time by cnn
trump is the one responsible
you meant warm
cnn advertising their own weatherproof clothing line
nice
my name is michael lol
i ‚Äô m from miami and i ‚Äô m just glad we avoided ‚Äú the big one ‚Äù this time
huge trump rally just announced in panama city fla happening right now
it was so close for hitting louisiana i live in louisiana
may allah god be with you all hope everyone is safe
climate change is real
first time in three years cnn went more than five minutes doing so
pray for those dealing with these problems and hope them good luck
good thing the school police officer and staff members handled the situation quickly and safely
hope everyone involved with hurricane michael are okay and not hurt
reality is n't matching up with what 's on here i had nothing but clear skies today
yuppers live in a rv keep the fuel tanks full tires in good shape haul ass quickly to high ground when it 's over go back to the concrete pad level up back to enjoying life
wow i do not now what to say
almost truthful
beautiful woman
too much makeup
how much more proof is needed to say global warming is real
donald trump 's message to the victims of hurricane michael it 's your own fault for living there
teach your reporters better english cnn
lmao they named a hurrican after me because i be makin all the ladies wet
why does florida get clapped by a hurricane every year lmao
i live in georgia and that thing is moving up north
did n't we have hurricane florence and we had 2 more other hurricanes
and they were small light flashing in the sky so you can tell it was doing it in a pattern
and one side was flashing twice but then the on the right was flashing once in the same place
and i 'm serious the light flashing in the sky stayed in the same spot
it better not come to virginia if it does i will be like mom we moving far away now üò®
‚Äú we are here reporting live from the winds of hurricane matthew micheal
hopefully it 's donald trump 's house with full force his vacation home
got ta love them green screens lol
are you sure this is going to cancel school
must have a really good mic or good editing
lmao just use fans to blow away the hurricane
how do the news cameras stay standing when the reporters barely can
god we pray today for all those people that live in those places where the hurricane is that you shall save them
its funny how unreliable the news is
when micheal was in southern gulf of mexico they said it was going to hit the panhandle of florida as a cat 1 or weak cat 2 lol
lucky bastards its natural water park
oh wow not even a month after florence is n't michael gon na hit the carolinas too and they just had florence hit them
october 20 2018 i live in panama city beach florida power went off and still no water do n't drink the water fountain power came back
very sadüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò¢üò™üò™‚òπüò≠ and heart breaking
somehow it 's trumps fault right
are you sure this is not man-made storm by deep-state
there has been a lot of storm in japan and i ‚Äô m very suspicious that it was sent by deep state out of agony of defeat by trump and kavanaugh
seeing it on the news is one thing but experiencing it in person is on a whole different level
i live near destin pcb is getting f 'd in the a though
was interested to watch the video about the storm
michael scott is shaking in his boots right now
so many that 's what she said jokes could be made
good the c.omical n.etwork n.ews puts their reporters in harms way as others do such as the weather channel and fox
but good comes out of people after the storm is over
it 's one more experience in life that is part of our journey
together we make the storms more bearable
good news for a my ppl
dang my brother and best friend are hurricanes
hey guess what youtube my school is still not back because of hurricane florence and now this hurricane life is great
we floridians get hurricanes pretty often so were used to it by now
debauchery is their only real reason to exist
damn what a great day
you know that ‚Äô s where they always happen in the ass but mostly the the governmentyou ‚Äô re the want to be spraying stuff in the air
was hoping for a higher death count
lmao it 's all fake news republicans
virtually no trees standing with many snapped off at the roots leaving only a shredded stump
it rn lol
i love barack obama
the man in the middle reminds me of that one episode of drake and josh and the dad was the weather man lmao
stay safe people it 's a powerful hurricane but another deadly storm is heading towards the united states üá∫üá∏ the name of the hurricane hurricane democrats
are they faking it again the real loosers cnn
he he is one brave reporter
i ‚Äô m scared i might not have a home when i come back home üòøüòìüòì and most my stuff is still there
hes apparently more stable than a steel railing inbeded in concrete trees swaying 8 feet yet shrubs directly behind him leaves are still as a dead bug 155mph
probably in a studio with a greenscreen fans and spray bottles real strom on movie screen
is it just me or is this weather man handleing the wind in the background better then say the hulk
how much do they get paid to go out there
can hurricanes even be classified as news anymore so many happen at this point it 's not even a bit surprising
how many hurricanes have we had so far
don ‚Äô t forget guys just because of one hurricane climate change is real
if michael had another hour or two over water it almost certainly would have hit cat 5
look at these actors lol fake news
those reporters who are live at the scene getting intentionally wet and putting themselves in danger in front of the camera are clowns
how many harricans
h mmmm 155 mph winds and yet there hair is barely blowing around
i think it 's karma that republican states are the most affected by hurricanes
it 's also ironic because they do n't believe in climate change
people should move to new jersey because hurricanes never pass us only sometimes
wow
real weather
fake news u know all this view are just computer generated just to get popular
notice how none of these reporters are using the phrases global warmimg or climate change to explain this unprecedented storm on the florida coast
good for ratings eh media
why tf are they outside reporting it with 155 mph the winds can make them fly and they ‚Äô ll die
when is there ever going to be a hurricane in new castle county delaware
go to the beach have fun play in the ocean
they got good food
be safe out there
do n't worry donald says that they are not getting stronger and more frequent and donald is a genius
next time a large storm hits just tell yourself that more and more records do n't indicate global warming
i ca n't believe this people work live like this
theyre in the middle of the hurricane just working never happened in my country with any natural disaster
if your gon na be out in a storm like this id very much recommend having a mobile safety bunker so you dont get hurt and possibly killed
trump for 2020 cnn fake news lol keeping it trumping
the news media is probably paid a very hefty sum of money by the insurance companies
the more dinero/money each insurance company is going to
the good book the holy bible warns the following
i hope florida gets hit with even more hurricanes and the death toll rises
a new beginning
so the anti christ is in trying his best techniques to deceive us but he ca n't so how it can be the end times
it 's the beginning of a new and peaceful time
got ta wonder if dems are using haarp to direct hurricans at trump voting
if u want to live there u should know
that reporter is on a sound stage in front of a green screen
but those images can be taken just as easily from inside a shelter a vehicle or other safer location
they do n't really need to stand out there posing against the elements
panama city florida this is the wrath of god on you there is more to come..a big bust in your government to expose you and your corruption to the world for you are cursed there are tornadoes and storms coming to you disaster and violence and no one will visit you anymore
it ‚Äô s amazing how much more steady the reporters are than they were when the hurricane hit nc
quick everyone leave the area danger send in the reporters
supermariologan is dead lol
well i used to live really close to where the hurricane is if i didn ‚Äô t leave last year my house would be gone i didn ‚Äô t even have a basement
they had to send gas trucks for those who were able to walk trees and wires
tell those on that roof at new orleans collisium flagging for help
so many hurricanes i ‚Äô m so tired
wow
i learned not to live in america because nowhere is saf
good thing climate change is just a hoax propagated by the chinese
honestly michael was not a category 5 or even a storm remotley close to 155 mph winds it was a storm most likely with 140 mph winds at landfall what i mean is that iv e scouraged through many hurricane videos at this point and this storm was nowhere near 155 mph winds
look at andrew for example andrew decimated areas soley on wind power where michael did most damage with storm surge
i bet these femenist women here wish they were housewives right about now
nothing is going really good rn and now there 's a storm names after me
i really don ‚Äô t understand why anyone thinks they need to stand in the hurricane to give an update
my heart honestly goes out to everybody in florida
but really quick the reporter in not actually standing in the hurricane
hurricanes are n't real
please tell me how is he able to stand and the first reporter did n't know the name of the storm called it matthew wow
i ‚Äô m pretty sure everyone in that infected area are aware
the bulk of democrats live along the coasts
for once you guys got more likes than dislikes and you know why
cause you report on real news thats why
weather attacks from military nice gains for money-changers
got ta love that cgi
lmao
i live in texas
it 's 90-100mph barely even a hurricane
well as i remember it 's earlier than last year last year it hit about october twenty and it looks like now we are dealing with s that is more hectic than irma which i was talking about before and let 's see what happens texas and florida are in for trouble every single autumn
we are a filthy cancer on this wonderful world we are gifted to inhabit
lucky that im live in cambodia
this is the perfect texture for running
hope y ‚Äô all all safe may god be with you always
really
you said matthew lol you have no clue lady
there is no way i ‚Äô d be doin that lol i pray for their safety
if it was truly as windy as he 1st guy say it is he would be flailing so would his jacket also the whistle of the wind would be loud and clear
nice green screen
so much for causing global warming all there mostly probably is now is warm bodies of water giving off massive potentials for hurricanes to crush everything
this guy stands tall and in place lol
please be safe
everybody please pray for me i live in america/mobile pray for my and god bless you all and my brother is playing fortnite and he doesnt even know what 's coming ily all
i live in georgia
my aunt right now is stuck trapped under her roof that collapsed she couldn ‚Äô t leave with everyone and 911 isn ‚Äô t working
i hope she gets out ok
cnn lol
how are they standing this right after they get paid they die
stay safe everyone
over 270,000 have lost power so far
is john okay
this is a pretty big hurricane the people ahead area should get out pretty strong ‚õà
more intense storms as predicted
every year from now on florida and other eastern states ‚Äô low lying coasts will be mostly under water reducing the land mass in the us
very high
please be safe
man john is a straight savage
iam in it right now
i wish the death cost is 0 and people evacuated fast and also
there is a strong probability that this weather forecast is complete b b u l l s h i t t because my voice recognition will not allow me to spit to swear furthermore i would like to say that this is completely unfounded i look at this hurricane map and it looks like garbage and it looks fake but i will still believe it because it 's from a reputable news source
luckily according to trumpdy dumpty climate change is n't real.üôÑüôÑ
note to self look into making plans for next year 's worm charming festival
if you want to know more about the dangers of transformers look up transformers rule 34
i live in iowa why tf am i watching this
i armed the whole marine side with fully automatic battery powered nerf guns before i transferred
is it for more viewership
oh they will be fine
lol
yikes these hurricanes are way too powerful these days
gods punishment for gay people in new york
michael sure
florida you better not make a m nevermind
i live in panama city and there was sunny with no wind all day long
about that thumbnail i live in panama this is a hurricane
i hope everything ok
fema i 'm sure is standing by
clearly this is trump 's fault somehow
0:13 lmao she was going to say matthew
hurricane michael picks up water so do n't get wet this is a intense weather hurricane michael is one of the most strongest and powerful the eye is calm hurricane will remain until be
welp i need to get really for this
i love hurricanes no school tomorrow
in so many humorous ways
its like a and i just cant believe these monkeys are doing backflips and back to you jerry oh yeah and there is a hurricane coming tommorow just a cat 4 tho so ur good
are you really there
john 's gon na get all the cookie when he gets back to the station d
but climate change is n't real right
what we do n't realize is hurricanes are warm storms
so for most of us we think that after a hurricane passes it 's cool clear and sunny
well tomorrow for this area temps will be in the 90s high humility with heat indices in the 100-110 degree range
i love how all these anchors/reporters scurry out to the storm in order to get some air-time showing them their network being pummeled by hurricane micheal
i 'm liking this more butch weather-torn stance

it can and does happen but they saw more than one
his hair is barely moving only from the breeze of the fan
no way that guy is outside reporting plus we would barely be able to hear him through the massive roar of the wind
this is clear media deception
lmao there is no way hes standing there while trees are bent to the ground nice tv show smh
god make people okay
other winds ‚Äú yea sure ‚Äù
meanwhile trump heads to another klan rally in pennsylvania.oh poor florida just stand your ground everything will be fine
it just does n't look right for some reason
obviously im not saying the hurricane is fake lol i 'm curious as to whether that guy is legit standing in that storm or not
just the first guy the other people are obviously on location
how much you getting paid üòÇüòÇ
wow
ok im going to africa who comin with me
im pretty sure she almost said mathew
oh and do n't forget to get your pets to it 's very important to bring your pets it 's for your own good
wow i hope citizens of north carolina were prepared for this kind of natural disaster
a new trend hurricanes
green screen lmao
why are they standing in a near cat 5
i do not want to see a live death or any at all
how is someone not struggling to stand straight up in 100 mile an hour winds
john is a true weather master
only michael bay has killed more transformers
stay safe if anyone 's there right now
well forget becoming a football player how about a scientist so they take me to mars with them
nice green screen loser
off topic but i just wan na comment that i got some pretty hardy chuckles out the such dry delivery of a few quick jokes john made lol
if you 're not paying a lot of attention he says it so calmly you almost do n't realize he 's cracking a couple jokes in the middle of a hurricane lmao
wow me name is michel

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
please put politics aside and just appreciate a sons love for his father
i would be happy to be able to give my dad a eulogy even half as good as this
i did n't support w while he was president but i always believed that he was a decent man
this eulogy for his father is a wonderful example of that fact
i just wish other presidents are as decent of a human being
you know i 'm no where near a republican
man what an incredible speech
‚Äú a heart that ‚Äô s broken is a heart that ‚Äô s been loved ‚Äù there is definite comfort in that believe me
he was not just my dad but also my best friend hero mentor and business partner of 24 years
long marriage long life successful kids great career life won
rest easy
put your political agendas away and admit that was a touching eulogy for his father
thank you both so much for your service
i find it incredibly inappropriate that there are ads on this video
the older he gets the more he looks like his dad
this was a really really good and heartfelt eulogy many people mock bush junior and his intellect but i 'll say this
i 'd be proud to be able to give such a eulogy
good job junior
what a beautiful tribute to a lovely human being
the best eulogy
a great man and a beautifully profound eulogy
this is so amazing and it 's said so kindly by a great man about a great man and i pray for peace over your whole family and may god bless and keep you all close and know that you are all in our thoughts prayers and our hearts
love him or hate him the man lost both his parents within months of each other and obviously loved them very much and feeling the pain of their loss as we all would if we were in his place
i love at 12:03 he gives a little tap on the coffin like saying to his dad got through this for ya you take care and say hi to robin and mom up there
a fortunate man for his father be alive when he himself is in his 70 's
i will always love the bush family
this eulogy is just so beautiful üò´
this is 100 beautiful it truly showed a sons love for his father both were presidents but in this speech george w was simply a son that cherished his father
these guys made some good dang accomplishments
it feels like my own grandfather died thars how i still feel
i 'm from argentina i read both his books decision points and 45 which i found totally inspiring
i was not a fan of jr as a president but the way he honored his father was heartwarming and with obvious love for him
american cowboys are smart
and i like the full throttle or sleep analogy
good bye for now
2 bush ‚Äô s down at least 2 more to go
i 've always loved bush 's family especially g.h.w he was a solid man with a heart full of joy my tears r falling
he was a great man
a great father a great husband
he is a good soul
much respect and love to the family
i like george w bush 's family and barak obama 's they are really kindheart families
god bless you all more and more
playful little jabs and a wonderful tribute balanced in a speech that inspires others
thousand points of light
say what you want about this man but dad would 've been proud of this speech
i just love bush southern accent
i loved barbara bush she seemed like a very lively nice person she was full of life and optimism
i think this should put political sides apart this is a son speaking about sweet memories of his father
great man and great president
absolute dignity respect and honor
did'nt like him as president but he 's a gentleman funny and very likeable person
this is one of the best speeches i 've ever heard
the best public speech i have heard george jr speak
i love cnn because it always tells me the truth thank you cnn for keeping me informed
what kind of religion george bush jr belive in
such beautiful words to pay tribute and honor his dad
whether you like him or not bush gives a damn good eulogy
lol bill clinton looked high af
if you know in what this family is all involved then you can enjoy the show
george bush just merked every speech obama ever gave that was incredible
nice speech george
your dad would be proud of you
whether you like him or not bush gives a damn good eulogy
wow that was a wonderful speech
there is no shame in crying over the death of a beloved father
3:04 oh jared jared jared you could n't even keep a straight face for the occasion
wow that 's the best thing i ever heard george bush say that was real i may never like them as presidents but that was great i got love for this
your dad was n't a good president i 'm despised him greatly
if you wan na know what really happened to sr watch the end of the movie replicas hes still here
i 'm generally fine about the 41st
seeing president bush cry like this completely made me forget about him as a president with policies i did n't agree with and more as a human being just like the rest of us
he was such a wonderful man and barbara bush the finest of all of our 1st ladies in the 20th and 21st century
mr bush 2 is a great man sure made mistakes what man and woman has not made mistakes big and small
but his love of his parents his wife and kids no one can deny that
the most qualified potus this nation has ever scene and will not see again
i love the bush family from the father and to son
setting aside political opinions bush jr was president when i was ages 10 18 so i feel some kind of strange connection to this man
to watch him stand before the country again not as president but as a man who lost his mother earlier this year and now has to say goodbye to his father and a man with real love and pain in his heart this video made me cry
beautiful speech
i didn ‚Äô t know his father was alive
bush jr is seriously my favourite president ever fair well bush senior
telling the truth is not disrespect bud.but you can respect him for both of us ok
wow that was a beautiful eulogy
love your parents and enjoy them while they are with you
oh it 's the scherf family from germany do n't take my word for it look it up we have the right to change your name do n't we
from the moment i saw george w bush running for president i knew he was/is a good man
at 10:19 you see the presidents seated sequencially from left to right
nice
perfectly said
both father and son greatest president ever
is he really dead if true im glad that evil man is
i expect no less from cnn
was it just me or did george w bush did his dad proud
damn i did not agree nor appreciate w 's time in office but what a wonderful eulogy to his father
a return to decency in the oval office is much needed
that was the only speech by junior i have ever been impressed by could not have been easy
this is great
i understand he lost someone he loved but if he only cried as much for all the ppl he killed the world would be a better place
nice clickbait cnn
you know you 've lived a great life when all living presidents are at your funeral and one of them is your son
but that 's exactly where many belong in the sand man
i 'm a black guy from new jersey and that really move me let 's remember that we are the united states not the divided states
cool bro 2 more to go üòÇ
now you may hope that heaven and hell do not exist and you will find out the truth very soon in the day of judgment
even though i never knew him personally i do know he signed the americans with disabilities act something i am very much blessed was created and i do thank him for that
the gentle taps bush jr made on his father 's casket caught me good
he sound like forrest gump
rip father of the new world order
highly inappropriate
may his gentle soul found peace in the blood of the righteous
a great leader in human history
too many people dont respond with the affection of this man like the comments
george lived an amazing life living to such an old age was a blessing for him
being the president of this amazing country as well
i hope he rests well and is proud that he aided in making such an amazing country this amazing
okay
good with obama good with cnn
lmfao im sure its raining celebrations in iraq
good freakin riddance
i love healthy men
beautiful eulogy from a son to a father he so clearly loved and respected
i love you too
how nice of cnn to run three adds on a funeral eulogy
i actually was thinking exactly the same for those who have compassion for murderers
the world would be a better place if that church exploded
a thousand points of light eh
interesting
i 've always liked w bush
now even more
touching even for a lying war criminal
so beautiful i 'm speechless so beautiful
like him now good man good hart his old man color blind so of him condolence rice all way a his side god bless them
great work for the polite white supremacy
sometimes the headlines need to be more carefully though out more appropriate george w bush delivers emotional eulogy
1:00 in his 90 's he took great delight in copping a feel on a female guest
great r i p
his speech was beautiful a class act
very touching eulogy üò¢
lmao
dang he gave a great eulogy for his pops
classy as always cnn
this is the most coherent iv ever heard dubya
this is just incredibly wonderful
humor love and facts this sums up the key to humanity any party aside
yes he has every right to cry leave him alone you would cry to when your mom or dad dies
greatest republican since roosevlt
now we see these strong men pushed beyond there limits being reduced to poverty for lack of health care and poorly supported facilities and ultimately killing them selves
why bush didn ‚Äô t do more to enlist more troops i can ‚Äô t understand
we all are responsible for americas security home and abroad
there is a place for all with great opportunity to career serve or educational investment
i remember thinking that these men can ‚Äô t keep serving back to back and retain and maintain a positive attitude and healthy mindset
the support contracts for desert storm went to halliburton without any outside-bidding some got rich some died but george bush was our president and these men answered to there commander
i love how in his obvious pain he made his audience laughüíúüíú
this was great
what a great guy
i 've always liked w class a kinda guy
lol
i am surprised cnn showed this funeral was there no news by anderson cooper
this is much better than youtube rewind 2018
giving his best tucker carlson impression
ironic that 's where w and his dad belong
i never voted for bush or liked his politics but that eulogy he gave was the nicest one i ve ever heard it was perfect and so dignified
good one george
i remember watching this part live at my school ‚ù§Ô∏è
i ‚Äô ve never really been a fan of any of the presidents but watching this and seeing that george could hold himself together for over 10 minutes talking about his fathers death then to see him tear up in front of everyone really got me
all i can write today is read history sure the son cries for the dad that 's understandable but this is a show
wow
incredible people
nice play
george h w bush is in a better place now holding his wife 's and daughter 's hand
we all mourn the loss of loved ones
more lies written up by a hired speech writer
thanks for monetizing the video so i can watch purple matress ad during a funeral speech
i love that
g bush 41 did always seem like too much of a nice guy for washington politics
is it just me or is bill clinton for sure stoned
before u speak..read first who u are talking to
what a great speech from a president not known for his words
love your family
damn great speech good president too
he did exceptionally well
i 've commented as i watched at the end idk for sure who he was as a man or a president but i know one thing for damn sure if nothing else hearing his son 's eulogy he was one hell of a great father
i do n't consider bush the smartest guy out there i do n't think any of us do but i think he is a genuine dude
i think he got taken advantage of in office because of his good nature by the ruthlessness and insidious intellect of cheney rove and the like
last words i love you son
that 's more tears than he shed for the 9-11 victims he had killed
that was really touching
what a great speech for your father
much love
he loved his father so much that he did n't go to his bedside to hear his last words but spoke to him on the phone
that 's his type love
there is talk that he was executed makes more sense when i heard he only had minutes to live i called him the man said he has n't spoken all day but you said i love you dad he said i love you too son
i couldn ‚Äô t eulogize my parents he ‚Äô s very brave
w was right on and honestly his stock goes up every day
rip ghwb sir and thank you for your service to and for leading this great country
if i were to do a eulogy for my dad id probably be crying the first minute while im talking about my dad
this guy has wronged every single one of us on a scale incomparable to most things experienced in modern history
classic bush jr staring off the eulogy with some funny stories of his father
i really cried when he started to break into tears at the end
absolute class
please laugh
wow what a fantastic tribute from a son
a great american family
bush when the history books are written they will say that george h w bush was a great president
yo they straight roasted him
does n't matter if your left or right or na this man 's dad passed away respect him and their family 's morning
best speech i 've ever heard from the man
i 'm surprised half the audience is n't full of saudi arabians government contractors
no hate here
wonderful eulogy
i hope my children will remember me with love and laughter
i didnt know murderers can also cry..u have 5000 victims of wtc on ur conscious
yes he cries but he did a damn good job delivering his fathers eulogy that ‚Äô s hard to do i ‚Äô ve delivered two of them
great job w dad will rest in peace
a great eulogy of a great president and loving father
one of my all time personal favorite sayings isüò§ a man dont need no arm no legüò∑ to be thrown in no lake a fire alaive üòå
in fact is hwat the maneuver tossing a thing is know for it dont got no arms no legs and since im top scribe and interpreter of the law well then
great speech bush jr we all love you
we love you george h w bush
were all humans at the end of the day love cry and die all the same
no matter how any of felt about this man you 're still seeing a son grieving his favorite man his father r.i.p mr.president pray for the son as well
how can a man that 's responsible of the death of millions cherish the gift of life
i am lucky i have such good kids
regardless of politics this was a beautiful eulogy for his daddy he would be proud
very proud of trump
nothing said in eulogy about a testimony of whether and how the former president knew jesus christ as his own personal savior
a lot of people want to please people instead of jesus in the world we live in
death is inevitable but it ‚Äô s less sad when you live to your 90s have a long marriage and a great family career
what do you say about dad he loved me even after i did 911 haha
politics aside does anyone else find it odd for people to clap so much for a speech at a funeral
what a wonderfully poignant job w did that he lost it a bit made it even more heartfelt and again validated the great love all seem to have had for george hw bush
bush did an amazing job
love you mr president
very touchy moment
feels cheap to monetize a funeral
11:40 probably the time w has shown most emotion in public
not a fan of the man as a president but i always believed he was at least a likable human being
does anyone remember the whole cop-a-feel moment when senior groped a woman or the fact that both father and son are international war criminals
jimmy carter still alive is a blessing
what a truly wonderful man and family
thank you very much mr president and mrs barbara bush
i miss you both so much
your message and love will live forever
a thousand points of light
this is the single greatest speech of george w bush 's life
very touching
it shows the soul of both men and i leave this speech thinking better of both than i did before
wonderful job w you father would be proud
laughter through tears is one of my favorite emotions
george w bush delivered a beautiful eulogy
i love iraq
we live within realms of extremes
but also love compromise and growth
more of issue by issue
many humans of power have made mistakes
wow
heartfelt touching funny what a wonderful eulogy to a special man
4:45 lol
i love my dead gay son üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
no matter what your views are of any of the bush family that was awesome
cnn recordes this and zooms in on trump lol fake news bahaha
he ‚Äô s very lucky they had long lives they had each other for so long and that he had 72 years with both parents
wow
i did not have sexual relations with that woman
classic cnn
our enemies are innovative and resourceful
give me an reasonable explantion of 8.6 dislikes
he must be a very strong man to go up there and speak about his father and not break down
the killer murderer the real terrorist
many people were killed by george
i shed tears man we 're all created by the good lord and are brought into this world as little children as we mature we all sway away from the perfection and innocence we were created from hence we 're all children of god and
what a great speech
president bush was a great president and great man
i love w as a democrat and hes a great man
dont worry he is in hell
lil bush best speech ever
just shows how close he was to his dad and how proud he was being his son
distinguished guests including our presidents and first ladies government officials foreign dignitaries and friends jeb neil marvin doro and i and our families thank you all for being here
at age 85 a favorite pastime of george h.w
bush was firing up his boat the fidelity and opening up the three-300 horsepower engines to fly joyfully fly across the atlantic with secret service boats straining to keep up
bush parachuted out of an aircraft and landed on the grounds of st ann 's by the sea in kennebunkport maine the church where his mom was married and where he 'd worshipped often
mother liked to say he chose the location just in case the chute did n't open
in his 90s he took great delight when his closest pal james a baker smuggled a bottle of grey goose vodka into his hospital room
apparently it paired well with the steak baker had delivered from morton 's
as he aged he taught us how to grow old with dignity humor and kindness and when the good lord finally called how to meet him with courage and with joy in the promise of what lies ahead
one reason dad knew how to die young is that he almost did it twice
when he was a teenager a staph infection nearly took his life
and he vowed to live every day to the fullest
reuters/jim young a
reuters/jim young a
dad was always busy a man in constant motion but never too busy to share his love of life with those around him
he taught us to love the outdoors
he loved watching dogs flush a covey
he loved landing the elusive striper
and once confined to a wheelchair he seemed happiest sitting in his favorite perch on the back porch at walker 's point contemplating the majesty of the atlantic
the horizons he saw were bright and hopeful
he was a genuinely optimistic man
after high school he put college on hold and became a navy fighter pilot as world war ii broke out
like many of his generation he never talked about his service until his time as a public figure forced his hand
and then another audacious decision he moved his young family from the comforts of the east coast to odessa texas
he and mom adjusted to their arid surroundings quickly
after all he was kind and neighborly to the women with whom he mom and i shared a bathroom in our small duplex even after he learned their profession ladies of the night
he looked for the good in each person and usually found it
dad taught us that public service is noble and necessary that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values like faith and family
he strongly believed that it was important to give back to the community and country in which one lived
to us his was the brightest of a thousand points of light
none of his disappointments could compare with one of life 's greatest tragedies the loss of a young child
jeb and i were too young to remember the pain and agony he and mom felt when our 3-year-old sister died
he was sustained by the love of the almighty and the real and enduring love of our mom
dad always believed that one day he would hug his precious robin again
he loved to laugh especially at himself
he placed great value on a good joke
on email he had a circle of friends with whom he shared or received the latest jokes
his grading system for the quality of the joke was classic george bush
the rare 7s and 8s were considered huge winners most of them off-color
george bush knew how to be a true and loyal friend
he honored and nurtured his many friendships with his generous and giving soul
many a person would tell you that dad became a mentor and a father figure in their life
he played golf at a legendary pace
he was a good golfer
well here 's my conclusion he played fast so that he could move on to the next event to enjoy the rest of the day to expend his enormous energy to live it all
he was born with just two settings full throttle then sleep
he taught us what it means to be a wonderful father grandfather and great-grandfather
he was firm in his principles and supportive as we began to seek our own ways
we tested his patience i know i did but he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love
last friday when i was told he had minutes to live i called him
the guy who answered the phone said i think he can hear you but had n't said anything most of the day
i said dad i love you and you 've been a wonderful father
and the last words he would ever say on earth were i love you too

bush arrives for the coin toss prior to super bowl 51 on february 5 2017 in houston
to us he was close to perfect
he was n't exactly fred astaire on the dance floor
finally every day of his 73 years of marriage dad taught us all what it means to be a great husband
he married his sweetheart
he laughed and cried with her
in his old age dad enjoyed watching police show reruns volume on high all the while holding mom 's hand
after mom died dad was strong but all he really wanted to do was to hold mom 's hand again
of course dad taught me another special lesson
he showed me what it means to be a president who serves with integrity leads with courage and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country
bush was a great president of the united states a diplomat of unmatched skill a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor
we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend a loving parent a citizen who leaves his home his neighborhood and town better than he found it
that we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us
well dad we 're going remember you for exactly that and so much more
your decency sincerity and kind soul will stay with us forever
so through our tears let us see the blessings of knowing and loving you a great and noble man and the best father a son or daughter could have
why ca n't trump be more inspiring and brave like former president george walker bush
wow great title
disregarding what george hw bush did or did n't do or what others claim him to be his son 's eulogy clearly speaks lengths of what a human he was
such a wonderful speech only comes from being taught by a truly noble and kind man
i get that george w bush was n't the best president but some of these comments are inhumane
great eulogy by a son that loved and adored his dad
wow
what an amazing eulogy
very neat to see the trumps the obamas the clintons and the carters all sitting next to each other
to show honor and respect at a man 's death simply being decent
wish there was more of that these days
i wonder how many people were sad when they lost loved ones in iraq because of a war based upon lies
bush you are a really hero i think
sometimes a man who saw his father serving as cia director for two years then as vice president for ronald reagan for two terms and then another term as president it still seems to george w that the bush family did n't achieve its full stature in american leadership
only god knows who is true and who is not in this room
boy the media has really talked sweetly of ghw bush the last few weeks
the left was full of insults
but most importantly
iam not a democrat or republican but iam sure a human with feelings this made me cry
i do n't understand why this service is not in the church of satan as this man his family and all his murderous cohorts are going to hell for sure
he teached you to be a great criminal
what a wonderful eulogy by his son
he rich
if only the sheep would research and discover what old man bush his father and their family was involved in
2:47 bout to catch a fly billüòÇ
im so honoured the youtube a.i gestapo removed my comment.ha ha im so honoured but its too late most of the world is awake
i thought that a war criminal who is responsible for the death of thousands of innocent people had no feelings
such a powerful speech
the authentic emotion humanity and holy spirit of the bond of father and son are very palpable
and all i really wanted the whole time i was at that misery factory called a college was have another martini with my dad and laugh uproariously
i guess some families are denied the holy spirit paraclete bond of father and son far too soon
that was utterly and absolutely beautiful
wow
the amount of people getting but hurt over an ad is just amazing if ads get you this upset then no wonder why america is the laughing stock of the world üòÇüòÇüòÇ
how many steaks he eat for free
i wonder how many mothers father 's have cried tears of desperation at their loss of a son daughters at the hands of the bush 's families lies
on the gulf war the continuing conflict as british americans iraqi's libyans afghanis syrians die on a day to day basis whilst the likes of the bush blair families grow wealthy with the blood of others ca n't stand these despicable wretches the only peace we can have from all of this is that one things certain your paths are pre destined your meeting with god is assured
thousands have perished too date thousands more will die at the hands of the political elite
the only thing war brings is more profit for the wealthy and despair for families who have lost their beautiful sons daughters
we the american people elect these men to be our potus and regardless of our personal views of them there are times when the gloves come off and we stand together this is one of those many times
and i 'm not even being snarky you really would have to have a lot of heart to do that
fantastic speech by his son
actually better than most of his presidential speeches
your dad is in a better place
a true american hero
lol
a sons moving and loving tribute to his father who was also his best friend
your father would be very proud of you on this day george
cray cray thats last time soon will we ppl find u in your ranch and have bush hunting with only 1 bullet per person belivme we ar tu manny after cermony we have funeral on that huge ranch..whatch ur back we give u 1chans to go gitmo
'the best father a son or daughter could have i felt like crying myself
it ‚Äô s good to see the trump ‚Äô s obama ‚Äô s clinton ‚Äô s and the carters sit right next to eachother being civil
on the one hand bushes are dignified and old fashioned
you need to look at your own lack of morals values before you slate others
the best part of this is i do n't even see politics i see a man showing his deep love and admiration for his father
its very touching
that was honestly one of the best eulogies i have ever heard
say what you will about bush but there ‚Äô s no denying he is a good man at heart
thousands of children disappear all over the world for their ritual acts and power sacrificing and violating them the world already knows nothing can be hidden everything comes to light the cracks are many on the wall the lies are not kept anymore they are very we know everything we know and also spread more and more we are like a virus of truth and light in the face of darkness and lies prepare for everything is coming at them
bill looks like he really cared
nicely done gw
a beautiful tribute to your dad
i 'd find something appropriate and gracious to say if i could just stop crying
rip president george h w bush your son eulogized you with the greatest love respect and dignity
excellent speech by the best american president for africa
like most i did not care for him as a president but we all are human and have to walk this path one day
wow such beutiful words
great president greatest country
that was awesome
but as an adult i seem to really like george bush
he spoke this eulogy very well
one of us great son
good lord
'father knows best
god the father knows best concerning every human father trying to know best concerning any son he has or may have yet and on and on til all be fulfilled
and the father of our country too knows best concerning any and all of his patriot sons
and perhaps nostradamus the father of seers and prophets knows best for albert
vs whit president bush s and un started the golfwar and free kuwait frome dictator saddam ‚Äô massmurder ‚Äò
this comment section is more explosive than the middle east
this is the real america spirit unfortunately it comes in a time of sadness democrats.republicans..if we all respect eachother..like this time of grief..we america will conquer the world..100 amen.rip..president bush
what a beautiful eulogy
as much as i disagree with w on his policy and choices while in office from one son who lost his father to another my deepes most hearftul condolences and i admire you sir for that awesome tribute
you are a decent person
wow
it 's pretty obvious all of you are on drugs
hey people you need to stop picking on george w bush and his family he just lost his father how would you guys feel if george was bulled you people lol
beautiful family lovely respectful
many many lives will be justified in january
vince i have enjoyed watching you craig in the video his look s on his face the look s on your face when a man can t get a woman off his mind youall nailed that song never heard such good singing in my life my dream to go to the grad ole opry keep on doing what you are doing love it marvia bailey texas is craig s wife in th video happy holliday s to you all god bless you all god bless america
i ‚Äô m not crying okay that ‚Äô s a lie
and dad was an avid pedophile who also ate children worshipped reptiles and spiders
that 's one impressive record
it ‚Äô s a short life that ‚Äô s for sure
i made sure they lost their salvation and she was killed during a drug buy in a car crash
you killed so many thousands on 9/11 and iraq
former president carter noticed certain persons we 're getting envelopes he searched to see if he received his special envelope he did not
the demeanor of the room changed they all were ready to trample trump but something shook these former powerful persons to look scared
what a priceless look on their faces
i was n't alive for his term but i respect his time serving this country
how many fathers were murdered on 911
very touching
now tell the world more about the millions of people you and your father are responsible for killing
these comments are filled with cancer
seems like his tears were real unlike obama and clinton
the same kind of tears he showed on 9/11 acting is their business
how many families cried because of the wars this family started
this guy that is crying over his father should be crying over his decisions with weapons of mass destruction and using iraq as an excuse to settle things because of 911 this man has killed more people than any mass murderer in prison right now
i hope the whole family will burn in hell for millions of death children and women in the unlegal invaded countries
really cnn
i know it ‚Äô s gauche to bring up politics here but i ‚Äô m a very far left person from the uk and all i see here is a son mourning his father and sharing his humanity
this was very moving i ‚Äô m a democrat and i value the message
