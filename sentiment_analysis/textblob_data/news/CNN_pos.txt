-----------------------------------------------------------------------
creepy joe biden could n't even beat his own meat let alone beat president trump
i like to grab them by the shoulders and smell them by the hair and if you re a famous politician they let you get away with it not trump
easy win trump 2020
repeating the same mistake hillary did in 2016 focusing too much on trump rather than his own accomplishments
if creepy joe wins the primary i will vote for trump
lol i have n't seen these talking heads smile like that since before trump won the election
2020 is looking more and more like trump ploughing through the democraps like a bowling ball ploughing through the bowling pins
i think trump is cute do n't you
in the same speech where trump stated there are fine people on both sides re charlottesville trump said i 'm not talking about the nazi 's and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally
so i guess were basically just making sure trump wins again and we have n't learned anything over these past few years
it must be nice be a trump supporter
trump 2020 for sure
trump we love mr trump 2020
there is no doubt trump is going to win again in 2020
its going to boil down to two candidates bernie and biden and bernie would win but he will be cheated again and then trump will dunk on fuccken biden
what a lot of people democrats/liberals don ‚Äô t know is if bernie wins the primary it ‚Äô s the same as giving trump the election
let ‚Äô s be very clear a vote for anyone but biden is a vote for trump
if biden win the primaries trump will will the election easily
a vote for him is equal to four years more of trump as our president
in 2016 biden helped prevent bernie sanders from running and winning against trump
but biden probably has a better chance of beating trump
we are amazed how much trump is like the third reich in 1933
vigorous joeüë¥zionist joeüòà trump re-elected thanks to joe biden winning the primary
trump 's victory is certain now
cnn should treat biden like trump the way they portray to be so fair and do not vote democrat
this is the best man to get america out of shame made by trump
trump also said that there were very fine people on both sides 339 340 and then added i 'm not talking about the neo-nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally
trump is racist and has economic polices that hurt average americans
biden has good chance of beating trump but the aoc wing of democrats wont let him get nomination as they want someone with a üê± üòÅ
many of you were fooled by trump
if people do n't support the true front runner bernie sanders trump will get another 4 years
i like the other lemmings was willing to jump all over trump until i listened to the whole tape
joe is more gone than trump
even if there were n't the video issues the last thing we need in the white house after trump is an old gaffe machine
i will be registering every person i know who is n't registered i will do my best to get as many people as i can to the polls i will donate money even though i ca n't afford it but it 's that impt we can not afford another week of the lunatic trump let alone an additional term
not a single policy in his ad just attacks against trump
‚Äú trump is going to change the very fundamentals of this nation ‚Äù uhhh yeah
he ‚Äô s framing his campaign on a straight up lie as if people can ‚Äô t look up what trump really meant
this kind of self-congratulatory bs can send people in such a rage they might vote trump again
trump supporters are all negative angry and divisive people charlottesville is a perfect example of that
trump admitted and is proud to align himself with white nationalists
bernie 2020 he has the policy and the most progressive way to beat donald trump
trump said this shortly after saying you had fine people on both sides
hahahahahahahaha omg this is gold he even think he can win over trump ahhahahahahahahaha
slavery vote trump 20/20 for national sovereignty and the free man
trump as our president is apparently the greatest threat to our country according to joe
why are there so many fake accounts here supporting trump
biden i employ you to go back to the old folks home and do n't interfere with trump and his supporters from making america great again
trump must be crossing his fingers that the dnc succeeds in ramming joe down our throats despite the multiple scandals groping abusing office as vp to help his sons company plunder the ukraine the corporate backers of establishment dems would rather lose with joe than win with bernie
honestly trump is probably not a racist
hopefully the young enthusiastic great people of this country get out enough support for bernie or warren to stop this tool from gaining the nomination because that will either be 4 more years of trump or business as usual for the banksters war machine
biden is a humle good guy so i guess stupid america will vote trump one more time
now the dems wan na nominate somebody who can t attack trump for touching women against their will because he likes to do that as well
automatic win for trump come on dems you got ta do better than the same ol same that ‚Äô s why donald won in the first place
trump booming economy america first strong security lowest unemployment for colored people
trump will win again as a result
luckily for donald trump there are dozens of democrats in this election
garunteed trump 4 more years
why do n't they hold biden to the same ethical standards that they hold trump when it comes to his treatment of women
either trump wins again or dems create a toxic atmosphere to abolish their trust here to election time to re elect mr trump
biden is the one trump fears the most
trump is the best president ever
it should n't matter what political party trump belongs to or how wealthy he is
david gregory a cnn reporter just said ‚Äú economy stock market americans being safe ‚Äù are all strengths for trump but obviously he isn ‚Äô t fit to be president because he isn ‚Äô t a nice guy
first of all the attack on donald trump is totally bogus
he should have added except for donald trump is stronger bigger and more powerful than any of these things because i just told you that he has the power to forever alter the character of the entire nation
joe biden lied about president trump just like the media has about the speech he gave on the tragedy in charlottesville when president trump stated there were fine people on both sides he was talking about the ones in favor taking down a statue and the ones wanting to keep it up he was not talking about white nationalists neo-nazis the ku klux klan and the leftist protesters in antifa he flat out denounced white nationalists neo-nazis the ku klux klan and the leftist protesters in antifa
the most powerful economies and stock market under trump like we have
someone needs to tell sleepy joe he is running against 19 other democrats right now not president trump
so biden starts his campaign lying about president trump beautiful
trump now has absolutely nothing to worry about
im happy as fk also not only cnn so cnn has biden trump has fox so all you trump trolls need to eat biden shirt biden 2020 and beyond
the most promising democrat running right now probably the only one to stop trump driving the us against a wall
o well guess that 's it for all the other candidates we know exactly who the dems have chosen to lose to trump in 2020
trump knew how to connect to millennials by doing new things like engaging his demographic through twitter
they shoulda put the young latina woman to duke it with trump
crystal ball says trump 2020 win
he is coming for trump directly
if the establishment pushes biden through the primaries whether legally done or not enjoy four more years of trump for your greed
trump was not talking about nazis being fine
and then will biden or harris win and than trump have a second term and the russiagate will rise again with mueller 2.0
bernard is the only one capable of taking down trump
my first time voting in 2020 and i 'm voting for trump
hillary 2.0 do you want trump to win
biden is how trump wins
will at least be better than trump
trump is going to win regardless
anyone anyone at all is better than trump admittedly i would like to see elizabeth warren win or bernie not sure yet but if it takes biden to bring us home to the business of being america rules america and not russsia stealing america via putans puppets who foy a voice and platform took to have their individual pockets and rise to power the current president and all his cronies who cant wont do their job as a party not due to loyalty to individual 1 but out of fear that they will be seen found out implicated exposed for the disgraceful dishonest we sold our country to an enemy people i dont hate trump or the republican party i simply hate hatred so who ever has the best chance in bringing us back to the nation we have always been both here at home and to foriegn countries america the beautiful peace and more power 2 u
unless bernie drops out or becomes biden 's running mate trump will win
in all seriousness if the democrats want a realistic chance against donald trump then joe biden is not the one let 's get a andrew yang tulsi gabbard ticket why elect old establishment elites
edit i 'll probably end up voting for trump because knowing the dnc they are probably foaming in the mouth for biden and will make sure he gets the nomination shame
hahaha trump will be dancing of joy sleepy joe is running trying to keep hillary and barrack out of jail
having the word lie in your campaign slogan during this trump era seems like pure suicide
just like trump said if obama and biden were so great he would n't be president today
when trump said good folks on both sides he meant republicans and dembulbs not neo nazis of which there few
the rest are just saying best things against trump including the new entrant
talk policies and not bad mouthing trump
i really don ‚Äô t care who it is i just want them to beat trump and be a good president while in office
you 're exactly right we do need to remember who we are trump 2020
i 'd vote for him or pretty much anyone over trump but this his infomercial is pretty lame
good to see biden confront trump head-on with the white supremacy stuff
trump 2020 lol this is great news biden ‚Äô s son has colluded with china before trump was ever thinking about running
good luck in 2020 anything to get donald trump out the white house
all i saw was 3 minutes of biden attacking trump what are your major policy positions sir
nope he is never going to win look at the energy level of donald trump the man got what it takes
i 'm not voting for him i 'm voting for andrew yang but i felt very inspired and proud to be a american.this is coming from someone who voted for trump in the previous election
of course cnn is excited though it was all trump trump trump where ‚Äô s the actual ideas that people vote for
trump is the best thing that could ‚Äô ve happened to america since america was formed
trump never said the racists were fine people he was talking about the people on opposing sides of the statue issue
telling lies about what really happened and how president trump responded which the media is manipulating
that 's what got us trump in the first place
just focusing on the racism and bigotry of trump is not gon na fix the gap of income and equality making the rich and corporations pay their fair share of taxes ending the illegal wars education and jobs
he will split the vote so trump can win he has no chance whatsoever of victory
trump supporters scream about him being creepy but don ‚Äô t care about their president saying he wouldn ‚Äô t kind dating his own daughter
and trump wins again
trump we have a race problem in this country and the american people wants to know how are you going to bring the american people together and end racism in this country
cnn is wet right now biden is running i wonder if they will attack him at all even one ioda the amount they did with trump
if he is the dem candidate trump will win again
how libellous it would be hilarious to see if trump sues for this slander on charlottesville
biden is going to make trump a villain which meets trump on his own terms since he makes his opponents small
no policies all i 'm good trump is bad with loud music ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
the only one who can directly defeat donald trump no one else
trump refers to joe biden as ‚Äú sleepy joe ‚Äù let ‚Äô s be clear biden can do more for americans while he ‚Äô s sleeping than trump could do being awake 24 hours a day
if biden is the best the dems can muster trump wo n't even need to run a campaign he 'll just win by a landslide while sitting with his arms folded
here we go again another win for trump
bernie is also not trump but he actually has policies and a good plan to help all americans
lmao i wonder what my president trump will say about creepy uncle joe üòÇ

Wall

3:21 3:41 that 's exactly how it 's going to go democrats have congress but they ca n't control trump
i could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and crap out more coherent sentences than trump
god bless donald trump keep fighting the good fight
trump that 's right
trump you could wrap america in heat-treated iron and it would n't make it great again
trump in full savage mode
trump has a deal with a construction interest and that is the whole reason for trumps obstruction of the process wake the f up
trump is comical ü§£ü§£
good job trump ‚Äú zombies ‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i do n't know what to do with it we have so much money well president trump there 's always that middle-class tax break you were promising right before the mid-term elections
trump is exposing the true ignorance wickedness and godlessness of the real white man
trump being elected in the first place is a national emergency
trump has bankrupted his real estate business now he wants to bankrupt the usa go figure
trump claims to be the first president to make history you have for being the dumbest president in the wh
but that 's ok because nobody is as smart as trump
how many more things are people going to disagree with trump over the country has improved in nearly everyway
i love you trump ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
fine now bernie can declare a national emergency to dismiss student loan debt and give us medicare for all to help combat the opioid crisis and climate change thanks trump tards
trump just said that we have 'more people coming into the country today than probably ever before
trump clearly does not understand he is the head steward of the nations funds the tax money of the us population is not trumps personal bank account
i have to say i have never known anyone like trump who can speak for so long and use so many words to say exactly nothing of note
next trump presidency is confirmed
say what you will but compare trump 's interviews from the 2016 to now and he has improved a lot maybe not on his ideas but he is much better at speaking and answering like a president
season 3 of dumb-old trump the president is turning out great man great tv
what deal has trump made money on other than the tax cuts for the rich
i know i may be a young teenager but from what i know about government this should not be called as a national emergency please dont abuse your powers trump üò∂
trump 's new har should say loser
trump wants a mulligan for the first 2 years
trump the great divider
lol what a nutshell the only national emergency is trump himself
donald trump is a man who has a hard time remembering the names of world leaders but without prompting of any kind he has regurgitated russian propaganda
donald trump has drawn fresh scorn for attacking montenegro whose people he described as ‚Äú very aggressive ‚Äù suggesting the small nation could be the cause of a third world war
hey america more money in my pocket and my trump family we are the greatest family in america right supporter
we need new wall president donald j trump he sounds like he 's stalling every time he speaks
it 's amazing how much trump hates president obama and he 's jealous of him too
trump and hillary were best buddies when they were spreading that birther lie about obama
we love trump
if i had a dollar for every time trump knew what he was talking about i ‚Äô d have exactly 0
trump you boast about how much money you have and how much you love your country
maybe trump needs to round up all his rich pals and 'pass the hat those crooks and scammers sure got the dough
trump is the best president ever
for those who disagree please make your large checks payable to the trump foundation
and trump admits this is not an emergency he just is throwing a tantrum because he wants a wall now and forgets to mention that he promised mexico would pay for it
donald john trump is one of the most honest and righteous man i ever had the pleasure of working with
donald trump came to hospital to see me after i got into a fight due to my own fault
seems weird how trump is making all these great achievements to better american lives but many do not appreciate his accomplishments
is trump going to have family members hold up pictures of loved ones killed today in shooting duh of course not
trump is about as ready to be the leader of the free world as my five year old maltese puppy dog
in fact my yapping 9 lb dog might be more more adept at understanding the job than trump always a low bar to clear
he he he he the sound of the voices of trump supporters is always about control and victory you are not your brother 's keepers like cain denied himself after killing abel
we know trump has already cost us millions for his golf outings ca n't even imagine how much he has cost the tax payers for lawyers since he was fraudulently elected on his scams
shameful that trump used those poor angel mums as political fodder whilst so many more parents and children that he separated from their parents with no way of reuniting them are treated worse than animals there are now as of this week crisis overcrowding 30 children in cages for 15 that fact that this is continuing with little media coverage will go down as one of the greatest humanitarian travesties of any presidencies akin to some of the racial atrocities of the past
recent events after trump was elected thanks for all believed in him voted for his idea
trump has presented facts he combined with ideas to build the wall constitute the greatest force in the world
mr trump you are a great danger to humanity
fair shake get rid o trump
lol cnn is pure anti republican propaganda they are only saying ‚Äû bad trump ‚Äù he won with clinton and he is a presiden so he is deciting in your country
since people wo n't allow a trump statue with they money him do the wall i think him wants not be forgoten and is why him wants left something to people remember him
so trump is going to declare a national emergency over an emergency that he created then steal 8 billion dollars from the budget to fund his midevil wall and completely reject the democrats bills aimed at realistic border security that would aim at every single sector or the border yet his idiotic supporters still think all of this is great
no construction business with ties to the trump company should be considered for the job since ultimately a big chunk of that money would go straight into the pockets of trump and his family
since he is now making the taxpayers in this country pay for his wall taxpayers which he is not one of trump should be required to take time out of his executive time to report to the citizens of this country what is being done with the money and how much has been spent this report needs to be fact based and not one of his fantasies
bush added 5.85t and trump has already added 2.25t in first 2 years
it is a violation of the constitution set up just to prevent this kind of executive abuse but trump would n't know what the constitution says because he ca n't read above a 2nd grade level no offense to 2nd graders who at least are earnest and willing to learn
trump is great
lol trump is really ridiculous his entire admin gameplan resorts on building a wall across mexico border to trive upon construction interest
trump is great
obama declared 12 national emergencies when he was in office for 8 years just because president trump has it you guys do n't like it but it 's okay for obama to do it right
at least trump is n't swimming in that ocean of innocent blood the way margret sanger and her blood thirsty feminazi 's are
man i love trump
the only thing trump did was come in at the last minute and talk to kim jung mainly because kim jung wanted to meet trump trump was/is a celebrity and he just had to meet him
i am always amazed how trump rarely gives details about anything just assertions and of coarse statements indicating that other people know nothing and remember nothing on trump knows and remembers pompous narcissist so glad he is the the leader of the most powerful country in the world no chance that could go wrong
whole world is seeing there is less unity they should support the national powers they should respect their leader trump
haha i loved when trump called cnn fake news and told them to sit down üëåüèªüëçüèª trump 2020
trump wins
good job trump
i assume the dislikes are at cnn 's expense because trump is the best president and cnn is fake news
trump os the greatest president
trump wins
trump 's the greatest president we 've ever had
clear some room on mount rushmore for donald trump the greatest president in the last 100 years
i wish more people could think for themselves and not just jump on the trump hater bandwagon
it really feels like dems would rather see trump fail than have a safe country
trump is most accomplished president
people around the world wish they had trump for their president who fights what is best for americans
america is so proud of trump
latino for trump 2020
trump wins again
trump goes by his gut statistical wise
american banks are the real drug dealers 2 trump will take 7 billion dollars to weaken the military 's morale
does trump have a speech writer on drugs or is trump 's inane ramble all his own work
trump really wants to get a nobel peace prize
trump knows that no matter what anybody says about him or his decisions his private access to the supreme court will ensure his success
i love trump so much plus he tall and handsome
let 's count how many times trump says billions in this one short video
i do n't care what anyone say 's if trump could he would deport all the black youths of the usa to africa if he could they kill more people than illegal immigrants they deal more drug 's than illegal immigrants they commit more crimes full stop
in the usa was here before trump came to office thank you very much
trump wants to put a stop to it all together its that simple
trump is not telling people that they can not come to america he just wants people to do it leagally and be vetted before they can enter this country which they all should be
the reporter at the beginning who joked with trump and seemed nice will now have to come out and tell everyone how he hates trump or he 'll lose his job
god bless president trump the first family and the entire trump administration
trump said zte got a lot of penalties in a week right
trump yhu sound very badmind
look full disclosure ive been smoking some weed but i feel i still make more sense than trump in that speech
it is a clear evidence that trump is running the show in order to avoid/delay muller investigation prosecution
how many days will trump be able to run the show with border wall national emergency government shut down etc before orange jump suit
oh good trump can get his re-election trophy to display to his followers so he can stay in office and destroy this country more
trump says i dont really need to build the wall now but i just want to get it done quickly
trump really needs that owes puttin 4 the emails he asked 4 remember
they elected trump because he was suppose to be the great negotiator fixer
üòÇ it ‚Äô s funny when trump gets risky questions
thanks trump

its ok there is good people on both sides trump
is n't life under trump and his peachy fans gotten so much smoother and peaceful since 2016
i think trump is calling quits on the make america great again everything just got worse
barr wrote ‚Äú the special counsel ‚Äô s investigation did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 u.s presidential election
although the investigation established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities ‚Äù notes on the mueller report a reading diary by benjamin wittes
trump good people on both sides
it could well be one of the fine people that trump believes are in the neo nazi movement
did n't trump say the jews will not replace us people are fine people yesterday
he must be one of those fine people trump was telling us about
trump will be like well there were good people on both sides
trump and the news need to start educating people about that fact that statistics show that most acts of terrorism that occur in america are perpetrated by white american men america needs to come to terms with these problems and then the country can start to heal
trump and the news need to start educating people about that fact that statistics show that most acts of terrorism that occur in america are perpetrated by white american men america needs to come to terms with these problems and then the country can start to heal
us presidents have always led the free world with peace not anymore with trump
yet another one of trump ‚Äô s ‚Äò very fine people ‚Äô killing innocent people
i suppose trump believes that the killer was a very fine person
welcome to the trump effect
thanks trump
reasonable question to ask when so many planning terrorist attacks so far have been trump supporters and he gets such support from the far right
trump has really gotten to america it 's ridiculous how they are getting away with terrorist crimes but not called a terrorist how many more churches in this world has to go down this month this is crazy
