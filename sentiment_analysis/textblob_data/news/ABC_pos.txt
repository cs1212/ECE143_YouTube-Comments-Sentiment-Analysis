-----------------------------------------------------------------------
make groping great again
theresa may has more of a chance
absolutely love the pandering
look i know we 're all a little iffy about white people nowadays but just so you know and take a look at all these charlottesville guys with tiki torches i 'm one of the good ones now instead of waiting to hear some policy go out and vote for me
biden 2020 one of the good ones
yeah like the first amendment which went out the proverbial window ever since then
i love how joe biden is saying make america great again
joe biden announces that 12 year old penelope griswald will be his running mate for the up coming elections
if a republican was against gay marriage in 1995 they 're immediately homophobic to joe biden but if biden was against desegregation in the 1970s it means only trump and people at charlottesville have ever been racist loooooool
sure joe
he ’ s been running for president before his son was even born lol
hey joe the attorney general wants to ask you a few questions something about spying during the obama administration
the democratic party is like when you go to the circus and see the little clown car and the clowns keep coming out how many can there be
i cant wait to hear what he has to say george nonsense more of obama policy same o same calling republicans racist
maybe he will legalize child touching 😖
and i want more lap dances from your women
abc news what 's he going to do about aoc and what she said about him ca n't wait to see them all turn on each other lol
great job joe you race pimp
thanks for making it easier for trump
really
maybe that is why the democrats want to allow underage voting and criminals in prisons to vote so they can add even more candidates
girls ready for the back massages
i 'm willing to bet all my saving this fool will be the first to drop
i 'm going to love watching the circus of the left
they eat their own grab the popcorn
i remember the last democratic nominee convention sanders had all the votes but debbie wasserman schultz rigged it in favor of hillary it 'll be funny to watch them cannibalize themselves again this time
good god a government lifer is the very last person we need running this country
if biden is so great why has n't obama endorsed his run
biden said because he wants it to be on merit but i think a glowing reference from your boss of 8 years who formerly filled the position you 're applying for would be exactly the kind of merit everyone would expect
how bizarre
this guy is eerily reminiscent of one of the old klu klux klan grand masters of the1960s
he acts like the kind of guy you could imagine driving around somewhere in georgia with a confederate battle flag in the back of his truck
i ca n't think of a better film made 40plus years ago that clearly defines our situation now
what has he really ever done
i 'm aware of joe he 's the one with his hoof in his mouth
get this rous rat of unusual size out of the oval office
for all those great people out there that hold doors and say thank you
i love you 😘
isn ’ t this the old perv who publicly gropes children
i think the likers are mostly located from l.a and n.y
biden is starting his campaign on the fine people hoax
biden claimed — falsely — that trump called neo-nazis who marched in charlottesville virginia in august 2017 “ very fine people ” — when in fact trump said the neo-nazis “ should be condemned totally ” as the transcript proves
breitbart news was founded by two best friends and my mentors andrew breitbart and larry solov … both jewish
these men created a site designed to call out the exact hypocrisy exhibited by biden this morning
trump has the economy doing great
the whole strategy is to bring back charlottesville because you guys have nothing on russia which was your only hope a month ago
yes you fake phony democrat there are good people on both sides
lmao i 'm loving all this backlash against biden in the comments
alllll the nastiness says more about you ⬇️⬇️⬇️🤦‍♀️
the people defending the history had “ fine people ”
one more thing creepy joe sniff ole mika brzenski 's lucy will ya if you do that i 'm sure you will keel over from the stench
the memes that are comming up would be hilarious
i like joe but man those memes are hilarious
if joe biden wants to defend the core values of america he should denounce the democratic party calling it what it really is and pull out of the race
bernie is man and the best choice to beat this racist orange president
thats got ta be the most boomer tier campaign add ever
tell the full story joe half truths
joe budden has more of a chance
correction hair plugs it is you and your demorat ilk that are the true dregs of
society so right back at cha
he offers no polices or issues to fix america
sounds real enthusiastic
wow i don ’ t like trump
is this truly the best candidate the democratic party can produce
best get ready for trump 2020
first words about charlottesville perpetuating a lie that everyone knows is a lie
watch he is the first to drop out
biden is so corrupt he even makes shrillary look honest
keep the swamp elite alive
trump 2020 🇺🇸 keep america great
i fall asleep 2 mins into listening to this old man
the left sure is making it easy for president trump to win again
accused sexual abuser harvey weinstein
you know youre winning when even liberal globalists have to call themselves nationalists and reference charlottesville to be heard
go alt right
all good biden is a savage
good luck😂
good luck joe
he is a good divider for our usa and will sell us out with out a dout do n't fall for his lies vote for trump for 2020 and be safe and happy
biden has been in the dc politics for 45 years and did n't accomplish much and sleep often in the meetings
america would be absolutely f-i-n-e fine with another term of trump
what biden meant to say is that america wo n't survive 4 more years of freaked out democrats spending all of their time fighting their own government
no chance of winning lol
they super want trump to win i see
creepy uncle joe not my president lol
yes 8 years of president trump will make america great again
what a joke wow lmao
oh great another geriatric candidate running against a president suffering from senile dementia
another polished politician i think we need some new young blood
he ’ s pushing buttons like the gop fly that flag
he has the heart of a true loser
joe i 've molested more kids than the pope and muhammad combined biden
joe 's going to stop global warming and racism by letting in 400 million illegal aliens and giving them free college free healthcare free food free housing and free guns
no on biden he is the same old same old
he will never be able to beat trump
he looks so old
he 's obviously had a good bit of work done the slit-like eyes and mouth are hard to look at
the old white man that hates trump too just like you
your team called the deep state has forever changed the nation we just have a couple years off from you well if you can find the truth most of the media is bought by a couple super rich evil men because god 'himself got involved
hahaha this is a joke right 😂😂😂
trump and bolsonaro the best president
4 more year of obama why
why always so old people who are almost retired
f in genius lets run on the charlottesville comment the comment trump made was simply that some people think the robert lee statue should not be removed..some were peaceful others were not
john oliver lol
and more and more is coming out about his corruption and sons dealings
ever since i read about joy reid hating on gays then lying about it i ca n't stand to look at her
why should democrats or independents looking for a better and more dignified life trust an establishment status quo candidate that republicans so gleefully desire
i 'm wise to that trick
and you had better duck because he 's already doing it and if you do n't duck you are about to get creamed by the trump train coming full speed down the tracks old uncle joe
but like they said in the beginning of petticoat junction tv show and there 's uncle joe he 's a movin kind of slow at the junction
sleepy joe how can higher unemployment rates and a weaker economy be better for america
biden is full of 💩
we can not let him win
abc is literally gushing over this guys video the bias is still breathtaking they have n't learned a thing
maxine waters perhaps lol

wow so everybody forgot he 's a kiddie groper now
america is becoming great again
under trump and the dems are once again making easy for trump 2020 to win
he is too old and too out of touch
the establishment democrats are scared that bernie is looking really good guess they will try to do bernie dirty again
they better not
yay joe biden 2020 👍👍👍🗣🗣📢📢 more calm
too old will be 78
he 's going to need the millennial votes to win but remember he wants them to give him a break
i think he could win and defeat trump
not even obama will speak for him trump will eat him alive
good byden joe
now that he ’ s announced it will be entertaining to watch his popularity plummet
gropey joe won ’ t make it the dems want a full on commie not a ‘ progressive ’
we need a good economy jobs etc but we also need a president who respects the office
hahahahaha
run joe run god bless you n i pray that the best candidate win
does n't that make you excited about all those policies he might implement if his corporate handlers let him
lol dis nigga gay af 🤣🤣🤣🤣
most dislikes on this video than likes
lol
biden is not progressive no matter how much the major news media wants to push this false narrative
i do n't understand why the america haters do n't leave and live elsewhere like venezuela
for the love of god we have had enough of left-wing losery
trump will yet again win
they need to come up with better tactics or say hello to 8 year trump
well joe let 's see how far that gets you
trump wins 2020
he ’ s not gon na win
in the same speech where trump stated there are fine people on both sides trump said i 'm not talking about the nazi 's and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally
this is a new low because biden eaving out a clump of the trump speech removes all context
regular people on the right also turned up not knowing the klan and nazi 's were there
when he said both sides he was talking about the regular right and the left that opposed/were for the statue
trump did n't say the neo-nazis were good guys he was referring to the people who did n't want american statues destroyed so biden 's entire campaign ad is a lie and slander against republicans but that 's standard fare for the demorats
i don ’ t see any one who is good enough to run for president in america
i 'm a registered democrat pretty good move on showing that video about charlotte but we are gon na c how the media can fill a candidates head up so big that he thinks hes the chosen one as opposed to the real voters on the ground when those primarys start rolling trust me biden is not gon na be at the finish line
creepy joe good luck
former vice president joe biden announced his 2020 presidential bid on thursday morning with a video warning that four more years of president trump would “ forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation ” if biden is correct trump is right on schedule
américa is a ca n't forget nation slavery church burnings school massacres,911 abuse murders american healthcare proverty homless we have a lot on our minds to remember but the greatest priority is to do something about it
i think it 's too late for him 2016 was the best chance
oh i enlisted in the united states marine corps served in good old rvn march 67 april 68 yup did tet too went to okinawa for 10 months and back to good ole rvn may october 69 win duh president pulled us out and sent us home on the uss iwo jima
i successfully evade dah draft folks
good ole uncle joe
he spent a life time in good ole d.c
he got a lot in common with good ole uncle ho
have fun all in the demo carts socialist workers paradise coming to the united states of america
he is as 'establishment of wasting money free rides sorry about your son but that does not make you qualified
american 's first
so he just straight up outright lies about what trump said about charlottesville the proceeds to claim a domestic terrorist organization are courageous people
he 's off to a good start
no one wants this
if elected lol biden will introduce a law that would allow old white men who can ’ t keep their hands to themselves freedom from prosecution for being creepy
they would rather lose to trump than win with a true progressive who wants to help working people
but you need to address the social unrest and economic disempowerment that can drive people to that radicalization
bl bla blah is nothing new
we also need to get the video out there of biden telling a bunch of south american oligarchs that he ’ s looking forward to the us becoming a minority-white country
tell me again that if i walk into a 7-eleven i better learn to speak arabic
welcome to the race vice president bite me
i can ’ t wait to hear more of your pearls of wisdom
lol
joe touch biden if i am your president i will keep your kids safe hug every individual i encounter i will make sure everyone smells good i will keep your children 's hair comb with my hand comb
love how he implies trump supporters are white supremacists
the president is n't flawless however he 's far less flawed than you
they do n't have any good ideas or ways to help all people rise they just want to divide to get power
not every person who thinks preserving history is important is a nazi for god 's sake
so biden starts his campaign lying about president trump beautiful
the video does n't lie and if you were interested in the truth it 's right there for all to see
do you think this is the real reason biden laughed saying china is no threat america
please just go away far away
biden/avaniti 2020 haha
don ’ t get me started with how many women he has sexually abused in his time
yeah easy win for trump maga
attention steelworkers surely there 's a message going out to the steelworkers of america will support joe biden creep veep
he is dam too old and he approached woman and children inappropriately
biden will be donald trump 's john kerry to bush same old song same old words nothing fresh new
your platform has to be more than just charlottesville it has to be more period
joe it is time to let new blood come in you did your time some good some iffy
i know the primaries are in a year the general election in 18 months so do the country a favor and retract your run
say what you want about avenatti but he is right about 1 thing the candidate that gets the nomination has to be able has to be able to beat trump and that is not going to be easy
charlottesville was a communist freak show of fanatics stamping out american rights to free speech and shutting down a political rally with violence
the democrats will tell us its his turn and tie up super delegates 2016 all over again
first job to have 2800 dinner with health insurer 's and other corporatists
really
haha let ’ s wait for women ’ s filing charges for sexual harassment
like a hundred years old or what
you mean to tell me that in all of the usa they ca n't find any fresh blood someone with some fresh ideas instead of these old guys that are trapped in the greedy 80 's and who have no clue what is going on in the modern world
america needs some fresh ideas someone that is not a corporate puppet someone that can put an end to the rampant greed and corruption that has been drowning america for decades
the only reason pervy biden wants to be president is to lower the age of consent to 6 years old
can ’ t win
this man has been caught on c-span fondling senator 's wife 's and also touching little kids
hillary was not a favorite to not only the right but also to many of the left
many people on the left votes for trump
many said it was a vote for 2 evils
she still won the popular vote
lol i feel like only trumpers have viewed this vid n hitting up comments with negatives
his position is researched and sound
why don ’ t more people support him
i predicted nearly a year before the epic and many ways legendary 2016 us presidential election that eccentric many ways entertaining politically manipulative and natural way charismatic celebrity billionaire donald trump with nationalistic political and economic policy agenda will win first the us republican party´s domestic presidential candidate race and after it the late autumn 2016 us presidential election because my all instincts and my usa knowledge said so
i was right and i was sure too immediately after the late autumn 2016 us presidential election result that donald trump will be a two terms 8 years president if he stays healthy and he is personally willing to continue
the us presidency is quite a hard job full of stress and president trump is relatively an old guy
if joe biden is best what the us democratic party which has been in deep crisis since hillary clinton lost the us 2016 presidential election can offer to the us voters and the us democratic party supporters believe me president trump can win the us 2020 presidential election quite easily
besides president trump´s family saga is like the mythic american dream itself since his grandfather friedrich trump moved from the historical kingdom of bavaria in imperial germany to the usa when he was a young poor 16 years old teenager boy and built with hard work the base of the trump family´s fortune in alaska on the yukon-klondike area during the great gold rush with own hotel-restaurant business there
people commonly love that kind of epic stories
i personally like much more senator elizabeth pocahontas warren as one the us democratic party´s domestic race presidential candidate than joe biden
free hair shampoo for all 13 year old girls
lol
gross haha
trump wins 2020
if joe is atruly to become a real leader he can show it by getting the dems to indo our dumb law which states if one foot is set into the us that person has a right to an asylum hearing
it 's time for a candidate that will take on the special interests and deliver on policy
go enjoy your family joe you don ’ t stand a chance
you can try to apologize and switch positions as much as can but will never be genuine
trump fox and friends claiming that biden attacked trump i 'm not sure anymore when someone tells the truth the media republican trump allies attempt to alter the perception not just the country is more divided than ever but members of journalist organizations as well because if the media act bipartisan they sure attempt to shape public perception the last 3 year 's was a nightmare but also educational because when the unqualified individuals took possession of pennsylvania ave even mickey mouse would have done a better job
they are so excited and happy about it
so many negatives about trump not enough positives to even clap once for her
finally a real candidate
he has admitted to and bragged about groping women and being able to get away with it and he ’ s been accused of sexual assault dozens of times
put a pretty girl in the tailgate of your pickup truck
joe is the most electable candidate
my republican friends say he has the best chance against trump
you wo n't lose that large segment who wo n't vote for a black candidate or a women
get elected first and then use the bully pulpit to educate voters
from wikipedia donald trump sexual misconduct allegations
donald trump has been accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment including non-consensual kissing or groping by at least 19 women trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself can do anything to women including just start kissing them
biden looks good and ready for battle go biden you have my vote sir
joe biden is an amazing guy
maybe that 's what 's wrong with america people like you having nothing nice to say
i ’ m done voting old people and i sure as hell am not voting dem
my state has been blue longer than i been alive
from experience they ruin shit and steal more and more
the absolutely in sane behavior of the democrats is just apalling
it 's did n't work for eight years for the race card holder it will not work for a old white groper
trump will make him look more like a puppet then he does now
bwhahahaha he 's really going to run on this hoax
too old too perverted
joe bidens frequent feeler miles are 56 million one more sniff or grope and he gets 11 year old twins
it 's baffling to see how joe biden is n't even aware of his own history
there is nothing hateful about restrictive immigration and there is nothing hateful about wanting to remain a majority in your own country
he sounds very un-american to me
from 2008 2016 the national debt doubled while biden was vice president now trump is running a higher budget deficit than obama two years in
history biden copied a speech from a british politician and was forced to resign his campaign by his own party
he has flip-flopped on almost every major issue
the likes and dislikes is a pretty clear prediction of how this is going to go for him
bet its even higher then hillary cunton
he must be wise
go home and sniff hair joe no one wants you in the race
i do n't think there is any stopping that creepy touching of children
this old fool has no chance 😵🤢
never worked an honest job his entire life or provided a tangible good or service of value
there you go democrats your candidate is not allowed within 200 feet of an elementary school
the last thing we need in the white house or anywhere in the federal government is this pervy old man
anyone that votes for creepy joy should just leave the country because that will show that supports pedophelia
the dems really have nothing unless you want to be a socialist and bernie has that angle locked down
after trump we all need christ not another president why can ’ t we just throw the government away and love each other the whole world not just us in the “ usa is the best brown people are evil ” bubble lol all it is is a bunch of liars making money and then there ’ s alexandria ocasio-cortez lol she ’ s better than that but yeah all the rest of them just want to make money and watch you all die
i can not believe he ’ s building his campaign on a straight up lie
don ’ t he know people can look this shit up and see the pres wasn ’ t saying the “ good ” people were the nazis
you ’ re better than this joe
non stop immigration for nations is a good thing except for israel
omg..i literally died and came back to life to laugh more
hahaha
sincerely
see how far that gets you jojo
haha
while i 'm here i might as well add one more thumbs down on this 👎
with the help of the dem establishment he is going to damage the true progressive candidates who will win the primary anyway
going to be enjoyable to watch trump rip the dems all over again can ’ t wait for the debates again
i want him to win
then we win
it was filled with hateful rhetoric and lies
desperation is n't a good color for you joe
joe warns that trump could fundamentally change the character of our country as in low unemployment booming economy folks getting ahead all those things need to change back to the obama years with high unemployment banks failing being laughed at on the world stage
joe will have a hard time since bernie is the big favorite
he does n't have a chance against a real leader like trump
he owned up to his touching unlike him
the democrats care more about the illegal immigrants than our own children who go to bed hungry at nights and can be found sleeping under bridges and in cars
it 's hard to imagine anyone being excited about this i am guessing he will be the jeb bush of 2020 and drop out early
he was full of it too
and that 's a good thing and the source of our strength
now they think they are going to meme this whole white supremacy is our biggest problem into reality despite all data and fact shows being contrary
i ca n't wait for the debates to hear what trump says about bidens child touching problem
its time for the old men to step aside
its the young peoples time now
ok now that i 've been caught i promise to stop sniffing little girls hair in public
win or lose the ad with the charlottesville reminder is the reason there will be democratic president come 2020
're welcome
so its 20 against 1 in 2020 lol
0:23 get a guitar and make it look natural coz we are in nashville really a pos compared to what is actually used on that street
wow
he looks very old
i think he 's too old to be running for president
heart filled emotion with 0 substance or logic
this guy is obama 2.0 trump has built the greatest economy in the usa ever
it 's amazing that this man has multiple times stood behind young kids on live tv and grabbed touched got up close and pulled kids in from behind and no one bats an eye
the same tactics that make you buy a product or lead you to believe it is good or great
none of them lose as much as all of them lose
i 'm sure 90 of the people carrying tiki torches were paid soros operatives
you can ’ t win against trump if you ’ re platform is obama ’ s legacy corruption
joe cupboard full of skeletons biden
he will bring good entertainment to the elections
let 's get ready for those though questions
one of his sons is playing a very dubious role in the electricity company of the ucrania and probably deserves to go to jail directly
this is the reason why we keep on running in circles and why we keep on punishing the good and protecting the wrong s.a
yea yea yea we ’ re all nazi ’ s democrats really have to come up with some new material
biden is saying he 's good for america and donald trump is bad biden is not a progressive he have no policy
he 's a cool guy not wearing a necktie
1000.00 tailor made dress shirt 's sleeves rolled up thus proving he 's just a regular old sod like the rest of us
will the dems hold their convention under the big top
so many questions for these clowns
obama better be vice president 🙏🏾
13 million more people were added to medicaid
11 million more people were forced onto food stamps
the percentage of 18-34 year olds living with parents or family hit a 70-year high
the social security disability rolls increased by 5 million
first administration not to achieve a single year of 3 gdp growth
we just keep on winning
do you really believe you have a chance
oh wait you 're a democrat good luck dude
lmao obamas puppet trump gon na win in a landslide
good for him
bernie and boot both have no chance now the liberal media already picked biden for you lol
i see old “ sleepy joe ” is pandering to to low iq crowd and taking comments of what someone else said out of context
much like the republicans did in 2008 2012
lmao
his message is weak and overstated by many presidents
a huge embarrassment is awaiting joe
biden is a typical boomer still thinks it 's hate vs good when he does n't even realize that the most hateful people in 2019 politics are democrats lol in your interview ask him whether he agrees with ilhan omar aoc and the other talib on their various political statements
yay i 'm so excited
will guarantee 4 more years with president trump biden isn ’ t fit to be a night janitor at taco bell
joe biden has become such a social justice warrior
biden/harris is the winning ticket
we love you run biden run
too many others more qualified
we want bernie sanders and bernie is the best candidate to win against trump
joe biden is the best chance the democrats have
nope he is never going to win look at the energy level of donald trump the man got what it takes
joe biden/al franken hands across america make groping great again 2020
old white dude rolling out the racial divisiveness immediately
wow back and white film of biden with john wayne on the d-day beach
joe biden is the democrats last best chance for losing in 2020
he wo n't even last the top 10
just say no to creepy uncle joe and get burnt with burnie lol
sleepy joe is going to get beat down by his own party during the primaries
they eat there own
good luck joe but this video gives the impression that you don ’ t really expect to win
his hatred of trump and conservatives is matched only by his vanity and love for himself
either biden or bernie will be great to have as president of america
with my grand kids more less this country
joe biden is a slave to the international bankers and he has dispossessed the very people he was elected to represent
not one media outlet question the fact that a presidential candidate and vice president launches his campaign on a out right lie
what so he can touch even more of our kids with even power to get away with it when we see these kind of sickies getting into power it should totally validate to all of us we have lost total control of our government keep voting sheep it 's working great
baaaaaaa sheep baaaaa now go walk right side up on the bottom our globe earth because these are the guys in power who tells us so hahahahahahah😂😂😂😂😂😂 and this is who we listen too a child molesting pervert we have totally lost our sense of common sense the elite have stole that from us all time to get it back sheep start asking questions and find ur real answers
he won ’ t beat trump but he ’ ll be the media ’ s anointed one and consequentially will probably win the democratic nomination
he wants to stop bernie
i like joe and what he stands for he may be older but have we looked at trump i want anyone but trump as president i support corey booker myself but if it comes down to trump or biden i am with joe 100
his abit old is n't he
if biden wins the nomination i 'm not voting for him
more old white guys to run the country great idea 💡
oh wait it has failed more than 25 times
but it ’ s ok it ’ s america
republicans are going to dislike this very hardcore
my guy is julian castro bernie and beto but if joe biden wins the nomination i will endorse him
trump will get four more years just because he looks more aggressive in all ways than this nice guy of similar age

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
no matter what side of the aisle you 're on that action is a grab for power over the legislative branch of our government and ca n't be tolerated
6ft deep should be good enough
we currently have 30 national emergencies going on right now left over from past presidents
sure sure this crap is n't because of the wall
who told him about this national emergency idea first
if there was a real emergency at the border why did trump wait so long
i am sure if there were a real emergency all americans would want protection at the border
the only national emergency we have right now is the orangutan trying to destroy our checks and balances
trump needs new crayons and magic markers for his new bill to sign.oh i forgot he needs coloring books this will keep his mind from wandering.🤣🤣
many many guns at the border will work just as well as a wall lets get those duke robotic tikad 's up and running
well trump has one thing right having him as president is a national emergency
the emperor with no clothes is failing in fabulous fashion
thanks comment section
i live in texas and yes we need a wall
making america great by using emergency funds for a vanity project
best potus ever says everyone on the trump kool aid
it is our constitutional right
well as long as it just pertains to the walls construction i ’ m okay with it
this is great democrats will declare national emergency for climate change guns etc
i love the drama this can be like a tv show
how many trump family members companies are awaiting building border wall contracts
world is supporting trump leading sheep 's into oblivion
i 'm quite sure there is a criteria that must be met first
if the president tries to get this done i 'm sure somebody will go to court and fight against it
lol i know whities getting mad they got ta pay for the wall
as a real progressive i can not wait for open season on neoliberals
a beautiful wonderful wall that is strong and
how much does a national emergency cost
trump is an excellent presidente we have one too bolsonaro
good job pelosi
i do n't blame the democrats for this it 's their job to fight for less border security it 's the republicans to help trump support real border security
good job pelosi i 'll give credit where credit is do
america 's true colours on full display
he 's feeling very impotent right about now
trump 4 more years
i love you president trump
great white hope
first time in history a president will declare national emergency on twitter
also he does n't want to get trashed by the right wing media
right now there are about 60 national emergencies
one more wo n't change anything
get them all before you witness the fall of american democracy usa is becoming the greatest carnival show in the world
juggling taxi 🚕 is this fake news lol 😂
thanks for paying for the wall mexico
that is what he wants
actions deserving nation emergency status in no particular order data from official government sources for 2017-2018
education the alarming rising cost of higher education in the us has gone through the roof students can no longer afford college level education despite being the 1 economy in the world thee us ranks 20th in education among all industrialized nations
millions of us citizens die yearly from these conditions despite the fact many of these illnesses could have been prevented under proper medical screening and an affordable insurance plan
the first national emergency is then in washington not at the border
interesting times yeah
wow this guy is unbelievable how can something be an emergency for 2 years
why do you need to build a new wall when you got flex tape
all of you act like he is just throwing a fit but he 's not
i think that he will start a war in south american which will not go over well in central american and most of the united state people are from europe there will be war
trump does n't get everything he wants so he declares a national emergency
of course he wants a national emergency
then he has alllllll power and that is just what he wants tthewhite house nazi mafia boss
since this will be allowed then that s exactly what the next democratic president should do about gun control or obama should have done to protect american citizens
he ’ ll be lucky if it ’ s even close to resolved by the time he ’ s no longer president
good luck you orange nutjob
happy valentine 's day america it may be the last one
i think trump wants out
thanks trump 2020 trump you will win
no matter who 's side you are on a wall is still a better ideal than killing babies or rebuilding every building in america
trump is doing his great job but few people realize he is brilliant
sure he will support whatever trump wants
you ca n't suspend or appeal the constitutional right to bear arms via declaration of a national emergency you abc news doofuses
damn rich boy acts like a damn child during a temper tantrum
good i 'm glad he 's gon na do something right for a change that makes me happy he 's keeping the government open cause our government workers needs to keep there jobs ☺👍
great glad to hear it hopefully next crooked politicians sent to prison
the us has become a great feeding tray full of parasites
as to the national emergency it is a must step for security stability and as he rightly mentioned no borders no nation can exist
the president can clean up the nation like never before and set the native-english antiquity in its rightful pedestal and preserve the social quality
we need the true president to rise up and take him out in the upcoming election
show us a list of all the criminals names why is this so important
haha haha goooood
trump health is said to be good
why can ’ t trump use his own money to build the goddamn wall like damn trump you are a billionaire and billionaire
first we have the longest government shutdown in modern history now national emergency look out trumpetiers this can be the move every dictator do before calling a
curfew a gun grab the biggest fears of any far right trumpet and finally martial law so much winning we need to star learning the national anthem of russia
if obama had even attempted this stunt john boehner and mitch mcconnell would 've had impeachment proceeding immediately but it 's ok for trump to get away with it
thank god mr president we the american families thank you we stand with armed and ready to defend our5 country from the democratic corruption
this wall is for no other reason then trumps ego
we will have a national emergency on gun control or tax the rich or any other democratic issue
good for him
i m just say donald trump stop emergency plan could present a major constitutional test national why
good this should have been done 2 years ago
national emergency awesome getting my rifle clean
that is real danger only we do n't know
she wants to prove the president that she is tougher than him and believe me that is a grave mistake by her
if you are 20 years old and not a liberal you have no heart
if you are 40 years old and not a conservative you have no brain
orange pig-man is insidiously tearing at the fabric of our society undoing all that is good and just undoing hundreds of years of working towards a more perfect union this is frightening
lol
trump the narcissist wants a monument to himself trump wall
0bama had 13 'notional emergencies and the left was fine with that
he works ppl into a frenzy i live in a bordertown
from 38 billions israel aid that should be if he wants that damn border wall
lol tricky position does n't mean shit and this is a national emergency
you elect an old braggart full of flatulence
we should just put landmines much cheaper
i think if you have really restricive parents that you love and respect another way to say it is as a person that running a nation the size korea or small country throug is parents i love you and im a everything you prayed for or praid ford and wanted and it all came true you wanted to be super starz and biollionaires you wante to break the system and everything you go your way you wanted a jock that was good at sports he wanted a son mom wanted similiar things a really smart kind good guy that made or had his choice in girls and women probbly had a bunch of other cool stuff in it for me i got a sister too but it all came true is true
funny how he ’ s been advocating to build a wall since 2015 but in 2019 pre elections it ’ s a national emergency
so many problems in the world and in the country and trump still clings on to the idea about the wall like a kid throwing a tantrum
lmao
do it pres trump you are right
well if they won ’ t give him some meaningful length of barrier why shouldn ’ t he
funny part when he isn ’ t re-elected in 2020 this won ’ t matter as if it was never an national emergency to begin with
sweet lord baby jesus help us all
those people behind him encourages him more
even if he is told no the dems will use it to set up their own asinine plans and go trump did it so we can
top republicans are not worried about precedent they are worried about their major corporate funders who want as much cheap labor as possible
labor for many industries is the single largest expense corporations are willing to push the needle on this issue
get ready
national emergency fund should be kept for real national emergencies where people can die by the thousands like it happened in puerto rico
instead of turning to social media everyone needs to turn to they 're bibles
speak life not hate
ok i dont see why trump is going to call a national emergency.he can do what ever he wants the border bill the wall and they will still find a way to cross over here
chump should spend less time in the white house and more time on the golf course
my ranch is 20 miles from the border in arizona you know how many illegals i have seen in 6 years
this isnt a new problem
its decades old
for a president to declare a national emergency there has to be a consistent problem that has been identified and measures that can be implemented to fix said issue
i think the is exactly why the head of fema put in his resignation
good job trump
just trying to keep his cult followers happy
unless you think terrorism is n't a real things stop trying to make the wall about immigration it 's about security
good
as a point of monetary reference the uss gerald ford cost 12.8 billion so it really ca n't be about the money
he does n't even want it on the whole southern border what 's to stop people from walking around the wall and walking in
so el chapo said he paid american politicians off like pelosi and shiff and our new attorney general was voted in today get your popcorn and enjoy the show folks things are about to get real wwg1wga
hopefully the next president is educated my goodness actually have a ton of words i 'm not going to say we need a real president and not a con man
i am scared for our country on so many levels just saw pompeo you 're next
guess all the people on here talking smack talk about the wall does n't have any family or children that they would have to worry about getting whole of drugs
another democratic win over trump that 's democrats 2 trump 0 now
nancy pelosi if you have a fence around your house to make sure no one 's going to get to your house so you feel more safe do n't think about yourself only think about your country and your people they want to be safe too t
first step in dismantling democracy when you end run around congress but keep supporting trump fools
amazing 2 republicans who whole seats in whie house who live in el paso said themselves there is no emergency
america has become even more undesirable countey since he took office
its a damn shame what the rich can het away with no regard to the american peopl
dump is nothing more than a terriost and tyrant who needs to be put on the othersode of the wall so the mexicans can have their way
yet congress is still feeding this man what he wants he 's like a crying baby wanting his bottle..🍼..get it together congress and impeach this man he 's not only destroying mexicans which by the way he 's so hypocritical because he one 's employed these people smh he 's destroying his own people veterans..government workers fire fighters airlines etc well with all the damn money he has why does n't he buy his own damn wall this is b s a state of emergency for some damn wall there are bigger things going on this world then some damn wall..have you seen the global warming that is hitting u.s so if water over takes half of u.s and the rest fire
thank you donald trump you 're the best person in the world you 're going to build our border wall that we need desperately to get the aliens out of our areas the drug dealers and nancy and chuck is the one of the biggest drug dealers in the world we need to stop them to fire them or put them in jail
we need strong border is do now..congress should geve 20 billion to billed strong wall between mexico and us congress and then should make amnesty bill tougher that who is living in us for 15 years and do n't have criminal record they can apply for amnesty and receive green card with in 6 months but bill sould be together with amnesty bill not only daca amnesty for all whom living in us for 15 years and they have to proof that they resident here for 15 years border wall and amnesty together 2 way street thanks for listening
imma tell y ’ all right now trump supporters or not if you ’ re middle class and he does this state of emergency 🚨 you ’ re going to feel it in your wallet for a while
children are giving us the news o
it 's just ludicrous as is your system to elect that person not on votes won but on 'electoral votes being used by only a fraction of the people mostly won by who hast the most money in their campaign
does the american 'elite all major parties even care about the normal average american
it must sound like 'socialist talk for most of you it 's just social not left nor right and that is put in your constitution the better parts
such a beautiful natural country you have going to waist for not recognizing there is a whole world around you that is not american and negating the real problems in the world instead of starting war after war
the main point is that not a single person or limited group of persons should have this authorities to plunge a country in a ravine
its all occult the repub aint your buddies whats going on here its called the unholy union of opposites where 2 opposed sides are really work together towards the same goal the destruction of america and they are repub and democrat same face different mask 2 sep wings on the same bird opposites yet they both fly the same direction this is not bad judgment its just part of the plan we loose he set the date for feb 15 he dosent have to shut it down or sign it he set the date he can chang it he wont because we got sold out you are aware that maga reversed an old jewish trick comes from sumeria agam meaning swamp å.w
al maga reversed agam the meaning is “ escape route way out going out departure or outflow sumerian original agam which translates as swamp
i ’ m mexican and we are surrounded by walls we make all types of walls and people are very happy when they are done
as the earth continues to heat up countries near the equator will experience hellish heat waves and flooding
here in the us we have our own demons to deal with
add in rising sea levels and a shrinking us land mass who needs more undocumented immigrants running around
the us population will experience it 's own migration trends and that 's going to put a strain on local and state governments
we must save ourselves first
it 's a shame and treasonous for democrats to impede any presidential action that secures the safety and continuity of the united states
and tell george soros the hungarian jew who worked with the nazis and got rich off the executions of the jews and his puppet president obama that their services are no longer needed
there is a new sheriff in town
this is funny to me because it is so obvious there is no emergency trump has the mind of an 11 year old
lol
this is an all around win win
this day is almost as epic as election day 2016 and watch now
enjoy your dictatorship america
what happens if we piss the mexicans and know we will pay more money for fruits and vegetables
if it was such an emergency why didnt the republicans deal with it before giving themselves a big tax cut for the rich
why doesnt he put in the first billion
what kind of dirt does dump have on mitch and the gop
trump ’ s procrastination tactics like the military thoughts of france before ww2 were the same in the end and the whole army was wiped out
no one liked it when obama did this
are you going to go to the boarder and help so a service member can see their child be born or enjoy a holiday after already losing so much time with them from fighting a real war in iraq
individuals who want the wall built are safe and sound at home not making a single sacrifice
love it
all the american should step in and take nancy 's and chuck 's fences down around their homes and that way they will have open borders and they can allow all the people in the world that do n't want do n't have a right to live in america they can live with them in their home so i want to support nancy and chuck for them to them to remove their fences immediately if if you agree please let me know and we will make a petition for them to remove their fences around their homes
and we will elect him again
the money is coming out of presidency fund you might as well do something great for the united states jesus we rebuke the shutdown until he 's out in 2020
ho hum yes trump such an emergency that you did n't do much about it for two years the republicans were in power in both senate and congress
so not a real emergency just made up to try to destroy the democrats win in congress maybe
like it so far and thank you so much republicans you made your damn beds go lie in them
just in the first two months of 2019 it has cost taxpayers 35 billion dollars to house feed and provide medical care to illegals
thank you mr president for following through on most of your promises
good
ok and ivanka
the so called christian nations are the real lost tribes of israel whom god divorced and sent out of his sight and scattered them.why for false god worship sacrafising to false gods often their own children idolatry and occultism.this the lost tribes of israel are still doing to this very day.the majority.see jack flaws videos on the lost tribes of israel.enter the norman/viking invasion of europe cause god s people did not follow their god and they still don t.the majority.read daniel 9 and psalm 106 kjv.god poured out a curse on his own lamentations 5 kjv.tell me if you think the fake jews who rule the entire world sound like god s people in lamentations 5 kjv how many poles were killed in nazi many irish died in the irish potato famine how many orphands did these events produce how many iriah or polish children have been abused raped or killed in catholic run orphanages and in catholic churches by edomite/german popes priests and nuns how many children in bulgaira and romania are warehoused in institutions how many have been adopted by freemasons/satanists in order to make them loose their salvation how many in usa are in foster homes today these are likely the real lost tribes of israel.the catholic people.not the church.not the edomite/german popes preist and nun who rule over god s people for their sins.they will continue to rule over god s people until they repent and acknowledge their sins
speaking of which i 'm the internet police and i need your username and password to verify that you are a legal citizen
trump is a great great great man and president 😃
there are several groups of not so nice people threatening to crash the united states
they ’ re too consumed to get all those people to vote in more dumb o crats
are you aware the usa builds walls all over the world
how much stuff do you have in your hair my friend
build that wall very high mr president
i hope americans get smart on the president declare national emergency
but maybe the president is trying to create one just look at this headline havana reuters cuba said on thursday the united states was moving special forces closer to venezuela as part of a covert plan to intervene in the chaotic south american country using the pretext of a humanitarian crisis
when they were built they experienced less crime not to mention jordan has a wall that we paid for and they experienced less problems with immigration
so instead of sending money to help rebuild huston california and puerto rico we 're sending money to defend against a non-existent emergency in order to make trump feel better
meanwhile people are going to be losing their land to build this wall compiling no doubt hundreds of lawsuits against the government that our next president is going to have to deal with because trump sure as hell wo n't answer them
it 's truly astonishing how much liberal whining there is about this impending declaration
trump is resorting to this tactic not exactly because there 's an emergency down at the border but to fulfill his campaign promise of building a wall to help secure the border
obviously the standard generic retort to this is that but the wall is n't even effective or something along those lines but what can i expect from liberals who are dense beyond belief
everybody reading deeper into this knows the wall by itself is n't going to be that effective
it 's part of a larger strategy needed for decent border security
trump is fully aware that the democrats are going to be nothing but obstructionists so there 's no point in wasting time with legislative formalities
this is only going to get worse as more caravans reach the border
got ta love him ❤️🌹
a perfect quite knock out punch
stunning
winning
first
i love this president
first
keep america safe
first
yeah 🇺🇸 first comment
love trump soooo much
first
but then again when democrats get into power national emergency may come in handy over gun control climate change medicare for all etc
finally got a president with balls to do what 's right
good
trump is one of the great presidents
great news
thanks to the democratic party 's stubbornness and unwillingness to protect americans president trump is doing his constitutional duty by having a secured border and keeping out foreign invaders
good it ’ s about time
those who are n't are n't real americans
the demoncrats have showed they are the united states of americas new terrorists from within congress
and the crowd goes wild
good
make america great again
feds need the immigrants social security numbers to lower the national debt
most immigrants will go to farm fields sewer systems and garbage disposal industries

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Synagogue shooting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
what a great way to end your life
that man will never be free
no name 👍🏼 no face would be better chipper shredder would be best 😉
not guilty
fresh 🐟
am i right
instead of being a good person he became the devil
hey kid enjoy prison rule 1 don ’ t drop the soap
did exactly like the quebec one in the mosque down to calling the cops and giving up
a good pianist must be an angel abc logic smh
how does a not guilty plea even work here
his face never again to feel the graze of fresh air or the warmth of sunlight
too many hugs from uncle ted
kid probrably played waaaaaay too much gta5
great he can play amazing grace at the prison chapel
sure plaster this man 's name and face everywhere no consequences what so ever smh
man amazing he was n't ruffed up if he were brown he 'll be 6 feet under
omg he kind of looks like elliot roger
apparently doppelgängers exist
how in the hell did he plead not guilty it makes no sense he took an innocent life he deserves to pay
i wonder what justice the victims impacted by this event would consider fair for him
yeah we really need that boarder wall smh
he had a damn manifesto the weapons in his car multiple eye witness 's and surveillance video but he is allowed to pled not guilty
❌ this young adult needs adequate time in a cell and lots of counseling
ever notice how these creeps pretty much never shoot themselves or shoot it out with the cops
kill this clown im really bouta go to work tomorrow to pay for this shitheads meals
i would love to hear the 911 call he made please release it
he wearing glasses now 🤔 trying to look all smart and inacent
okay
i guess the warmer weather is getting people to start using their guns more
why does he plead not guilty when he turned himself in
a loser in life trying to make a name for himself by murdering innocent people
oh for 🤬🤬🤬🤬 not guilty
oh he 's still alive
these guys take a perfectly good
six more months of life
incredible this kid threw his life away over crazy stuff he read on social media
here 's hoping he 's fresh meat in prison
so easy
🤦🏿‍♀️ he 's not pleading not guilty
with all sincere respect and i mean no harm when i say this but he is officially trolling right now
really
loser through his whole life away and accomplished nothing
19 years old
he 'll get a chance to get his piano keys played while locked away have fun baby mozart
if they would have arrested him as soon as he admitted the fire he might not have been able to kill anyone
thing is he 'll be fine in prison and out in 4-5 by being a good piano lessons teacher to fellow inmates
youtube shadow banning conservatives normal straight americans
free him immediately
lol white like me
well thank god he was a coward or more people could have been hurt
he looks happy
so many mass shootings in 5 days today was yet another one in a college then a shooting rampage on a neighborhood after the san diego mass shooting a few days after that another one
hey jussie smullet got off free maybe this guy will get away with it
why is he still alive
his face looks like spencer from good luck charlie just wider
not guilty yeah the justice system are amazing huh
it 's hot as hell in las vegas
good luck
this is face of a real terrorist not the muslim mexican etc these same people who live right in the middle of everyone
“ make sure he gets to vote ” bernie sanders
the american attack or new zeland
there is more to this
19 year old
only if he knew jesus christ 's words especially love and forgiveness
love and forgiveness always
enjoy prison for the rest of your life kid
oh what a nice clean cut neo nazi and he plays the piano how precious
is the death penalty ethical or should we do away with capital punishment
now politics and their supporters are going to move in and create more laws and infringe upon our rights as law abiding citizens including our dearest the freedom of speech
0:18 lol he called the police himself
he committed betrayal against god and his servants may allah sent him to a special place in hell where judas resides
jaw need to be strong because he going to be sucking a lot of dicks for the rest of his life.🤔
pleading not guilty
drop a mini drone filled with fentanyl in his jail cell
so that reporter guy is overly attractive for news
lol not guilty
best execute these monsters and remove them from the gene pool
the media does this all the time when these white kids shoot up schools and churches everyone acts so surprised and wants to lighten the mood by showing us their softer side but when black boys do something they ’ ll go back to when he was in daycare and hit someone with a damn toy to prove that he ’ s a beast 🤬
the once great country is finished
they should used him for clinical trials instead of using innocent animals
let me get this right he goes and kills people then gets caught
this guy is sick please watch the greatest story never told we must prevent this from happening again at all costs
wow
we ca n't figure out how to better secure our schools churches and high traffic areas
same for the rest we let live
he is a handsome freedom figther
death penalty will save many other life in the future
another white mass shooter taken alive
what a waste of good hair
you do not know who you are hurting other than those indicators but that does not tell who those people are really are
i do pray that this leads many jews to repentance and faith in christ jesus
i wonder what kind of psych drugs his parents put him on when he was in grade school
wow someone ’ s going to be passed around in prison quick
enjoy the life full of unwanted dickings ya american terrorist
he 's just a teenager but i need to help orient him to the things that will become normal in the us
if 300 ira members and 500 loyalist set northern ireland on fire even going as far as making their own guns and reaching out to gaddafi and the plo for guns can you image the damage from 10,000 americans and a limitless supply of military grade weapons 3d printers and iso 9000 tooling
anything and everything is available online
right now there are thousands of abandoned ap mines on the chilean border with peru anyone can carefully dig them up disarm them and ship them in pieces
justice has been served and ready that anyone that are a bully that they do n't have everything but other they do have something of the feelings kind goodness and of the hope of a big family that 's right because maybe a people already poisoned in mind already they can not even handle the body attitude or even sucking of violence but at the end justice always come first
this kid was clearly contaminated by the 4chan and alt right internet ideology it 's obvious he will eventually mature and grow out of it
why show his face that 's exactly what he wants fame
19 years old and he 's gon na ruin his life with possible imprisonment
yep looks like incel right winger
free palestine
i wonder where america ranks among the most dangerous countries in the world high as willie nelson id asume
there is no way this white man once an amazing pianist could be capable of such a crime
now murderers can kill freely without having to worry about getting sentenced to death
it 's the illegals specifically mexicans who are bringing the most heinous crimes to our country
that would be the real justice
im 100 sure if he was black everyone would be racist in the comments
with all the evidence it 's a shame that he 's even allowed to plead not guilty
wonder if tumblr would think this guy is cute
it 's good to be white man lol
as a christian we have to own the fact of our antisemitism in christianity and teach against it and come to the fact jesus is a jew and was trying to change that era judaism to deal with that time issues same issues found in all religions
i do n't support the particular course of action he took nor the targets and the flawed execution but his manifesto was right and jews do n't get any sympathy from me
first they said he used an ar15 and it jammed
we lost a good boy here people
he 's a good kid just could n't take it anymore and lost it
he wanted to be caught alive and be tried in front of the media
he wants this publicity because this publicity is how they encourage others to follow suit
radical right wing terrorist
making white power powerful in prison pay attention things are happening there too
wow he 's a jew too
life sentences at 18 to 19 yrs old is a long ass time
how is it cops can murder a kid playing with a toy gun at a park and countless other unarmed innocent ppl yet every single one of these mass shootings they arrest them without any problems
good
good thing governor newsome basically got rid of the death penalty here in california
the new zealand shooter thought he would cause a race war and nothing happened then this dork kills one person and decides he is a self proclaimed christian and pretends god is on his side
lol
hmm it 's almost like he just wanted everyone to see him being mean to jews just a big cohencidence im sure
any day they can easily pick up a gun and do the same thing
youtube needs to get their shit straight and take action against antisemitism
i can tell by looking at him he ’ s not even full white he ’ s got something else in him
now if we can just lock up/murder the other few million white supremacist that plague this country we 'll make america great again
i ’ m very impressed how people throwing rocks and judging like they are saints
his kind are mentally unstable and sometimes easily manipulated no wonder they go physco
in the meantime drumpf is going to hire him into some kind of acting position in his administration
bernie sanders thinks this animal should have the right to vote and decide the future of our country while he 's in prison
looks like a fine gentleman trump
lucky ignorant bastard
hes so smart
lol they really brought up him playing piano
thank you women ’ s march for helping create so much anti-semitism america
they logically thinking that if jesus can be white why not then the entire hebrew nation which was by then a diaspora anyway
the islamist side-stepped the entire issue by forbidding imagery of any kind
the language itself can be considered jargon and has nothing to do with the true language of the hebrews
edomites constituted a part of the jewish people herod being one of their descendants ” the standard jewish encyclopedia 1966 doubleday company inc garden city new york pg
why does the jewish encyclopedia mention that edom is in modern jewry
that is their own writings not the klan
edom is in modern jewry
edom idumea the jewish encyclopedia new york london funk and wagnalls company 1904 vol
edom idumea the new standard jewish encyclopedia garden city ny doubleday company inc 1977 p 589
they the edomites were hereafter no other than non-israelite jews
flavius josephus the antiquities of the jews grand rapids mi dregel publications 1960 book xiii chapter ix verse 1 p 279
george friedmann in his book the end of the jewish people pointedly states that the europeans claiming to be jews are nothing more then hebrew speaking gentiles
the late president of egypt gamal abdel nasser stated on television you the jews will never be able to live here in peace because you left here black but came back white
koestler 's hypothesis is that the khazars – who converted to judaism in the 8th century – migrated westwards into current eastern europe primarily ukraine poland belarus lithuania hungary and germany in the 12th and 13th centuries when the khazar empire was collapsing
in the last chapter i have tried to show that the evidence from anthropology concurs with history in refuting the popular belief in a jewish race descended from the biblical tribe
i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee
jacob israel the first israelite and the progenitor of the black hebrews
ham:1.the youngest son of noah born probably about 96 years before the flood and one of eight persons to live through the flood
they are the true hebrew israelites of the torah/bible
and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them
jesus told the israelites that their land would be trodden down by gentiles until the time of the gentiles end and the real israelites black people would be taken captive into the all nations no other race of people other then black latinos natives indians people have been taken captive into all the different nations as slaves the israelites were slaves in egypt 430 years god said in the bible we would go into slavery again for 400 and ironically the first slave ship came to this modern day egypt aka america in 1619 the 400 years are almost up and that explains why black people are returning to their true identity
another trump supporter making the us great again
false flag shooting pushing more globalist agendas
not so powerful now
ohhhh yeah maybe you should have just been happy being part of the human race instead
full grown men feel the mounting hostility aimed at them and can fall victim to the impulse to lash out can you even imagine how it is affecting young men
you tell a kid from borth that he is a villain he has a high probability of becoming one
social media is a cancer
i love how tough jews are
usually armed and always brave to face a threat
the more trump tries to paint a picture that 'brown people are the enemy the more his people show their true colors
ahh look at the cute smug on this pale face
oh he will get his day not in court but in prison where boys like him will turn to real men
let 's see what kind of cahones he will have when he enters the prison population
hilarious not even his dear momma will be able to help his white hiney why becusse some of the dudes black white and jews will gi e it to him in the rear oooh
he will get some suffering in the little ole brink and will cry baby tears lol lol hope he dont comitt suicide while in there cause he sure gon na feel some good pain lol lol😂

look at every other news agencies comments of happiness and congratulations and then look at fox news comments
someone needs to take out the trash lol
dman the baby is lucky
it is necessary to hear good news every now and again congratulations harry and meghan
🤣🤣🤣 um ok so many people
every new parent wants to show their baby to the world even non-royals
of course we all have the most beautiful baby in the world
their new baby will be star in the royal family
it was amazing seeing the happiness in his heart for his first born
his mum would be proud
baby after mum spencer mum would love that harry
super danks yes
i know she is with harry in spirit and love for her youngest child
elton john so wonderfully described diana with the song candle in the wind that he re-wrote to sing at her funeral elton john could n't have done any more to make sure we all remembered and loved princess diana and now her sons along with their father and step-mom can go forth and make a wonderful life for this little boy who harry is so absolutely smitten with
good night good
relax man they are still in awe of the whole experience
i want to see a baby very close is he red headed like his father or cute like his mom
harry we had a boy thanks for congratulating us
ok
be careful to get your facts straight before uttering words you ’ ll have to retract later on
meghan markle may be the most recent in our lifetime but certainly not the first
for those interested please do a google search for britain ’ s previous mixed race royals
fascinating history that obviously most everyone including historians have chosen to overlook or even deliberately deny
surely that 's not good news
great
people here actually believe this is for real
congrats to your new son
first comment always wanted to try this😂
time to 'come clean harry
who 's your real dna daddy
love meghan with your entire heart and soul harry
she is your mate in more ways than one
a very special royal
men cant get pregnant
slut 's live too smooth to believe
i don ’ t care what they do with your children but costing millions for your ok looking clothes isn ’ t someone who cares about the poor
i happen to make a good living but i would never spend that kind of money on clothes if i was on tax payers salary
good use of tax dollars good thing uk have no other issues to deal with
we the world audience really do n't give a damn bout our royal baby sussex not ever-becoming king of england/commonwealth babysussexisalreadytheprinceofourhearts
because the queen has full custody over all royal children
lol that would be the best
but anyways congratulations to the surrogate for delivering a healthy baby and to the prince and his hag for the new addition to their family
stop trying to convince us these people are important
he wasted no time getting her pregnant and she 's related to them too
no different than will and kate and the amazing work they ’ ve done
abc news youtube licentie prince harry and meghan markle welcome baby boy congratulations
the little guy should be called mohammad in loving memory of diana
god willing muslim too 😂
harry loves babies more than meghan so i 'm sure he will be a great dad
i wish people cared this much about children in the system
did they really call him agon🤔

Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
i am so sad to lose this breathtaking and historic church
the oppressive tyranny of the macron regime should take full responsibility
crying 😭 right now i ’ m glad i had a chance to visit it in 2012 on my first trip to paris
i love paris and the french may god bless the people of france 🇫🇷
so tragic seeing this breathtaking icon destroyed
the sheer scale of the treasures lost is most heart wrenching
before the fire is out it 's easy to see many of the stone walls will need to be torn down and rebuilt because time has not been kind to the stone itself
the soft stone was saturated with moisture from the elements
luckily the fire crews have at this point kept the fire from destroying the bell towers
thankfully many priceless treasures were saved thanks to the help of hundreds of first responders the faithful tourists and passersby running in and out of the building as fire raged above them
fire crews are in the towers tending to hot spots and stopping flying embers from catching the timbers alight
my heart goes out to all like me whom cherish notre dame not just as a religious icon but as a stunning example of seemingly impossible architecture shrouded in the rich history of france and the world beyond
let 's us all do what we can to rebuild this iconic beacon of paris for future generations to admire and learn the role notre dame has played in over 850 years of history
the mighty can fall
the people can help the mighty rise up once more
it is the seat of the first child of christianity
i hope everyone is okay and i hope it can be fixed up
wow i ’ m full on crying
macron did it lmao 😂😂😂😂
old
its survived so much
same date 94 years ago communist blew up one more church and kill 200 ex0m
sky is full of heavy smoke
sad such a beautiful building and so much history lost
france needs to start fireproofing its other iconic cathedral at chartres
the advantage of this happening in france is that the superior artistic taste and technological skill of the french ensures that whatever rises from the ashes will be both breathtaking and fireproof
who else was watching the live stream
is the hunchback okay
i am not french but i am catholic and this is very heartbreaking
my favourite and special church
this cathedral fire is a tremendous loss to the world and the arts
the notre dame is over 850 years old
it was built in the 11th century and is about 10 centuries old
this is a historical monument not just for religious faith but of art to a good portion of humanity
when ever i see this i think back to the halloween tree and how they rebuilt the beautiful cathedral i will neve see it the same way anymore
wish they rebuilt such beautiful place
not the first fire
so noble and righteous and pure
they ’ re drawing a conclusion to the cause of the fire saying it was because of construction.wow that was an easy and quick investigation
that just look extraordinary to see that famous church caught on fire yesterday
for what it 's worth perhaps some silver lining can be had by salvaging centuries old wood knocked down in storms in the southern united states
good
thank you and good bye🌹🌹🌹
this is suddenly becoming “ the hunchback of notre dame ” ending
you ’ re welcome
she calls notre dame a popular attraction
so much history just lost
oh boy i just woke up from this coma and cant wait to see how my favorite church is doing
if so then who would be most suspect hmmm someone who hates christianity maybe a group new to france that does n't hold this place sacred
just seen a video not very long ago saying that the cathedral was falling apart
prayers to paris 🙏🏻 i love there 😭❤️🤧
why are many non muslims modern muslims pointing their finger towards extremist muslims
very fishy
it 's a sad day and a huge unfortunate loss for the world as the cathedral is well known and loved by the world
under building seven logic this thing should have collapsed and free fallen into it 's own footprint by now
they rebuild the cathedral in pairs and they rebuild the temple of solomon in jerusalem what a wonderful year and many more to come
this is coming from a true christian not an atheist claiming something he is not
also a monarchy would unite france more than a republic would
it 's unlikely to be renovations but maintenance and repairs on a many centuries old structure
good job that ’ s what happens when you don ’ t bully the shit out of your electrical apprentice
i 'm not directly saying he started the 🔥 but he 's been trying to disrupt france and build his own building in paris this was a disbursement of epic proportions
so paris investigate any new contractors being added to the team of restoration team
streamed live 5 hours ago that 's not live
that 's great hopefully the vatican 's next
may god comfort the people of france and shroud them in his glory during this most saddest day
calm down they can rebuild
and you are one of the participants in the destruction of serbia for 90 years through economic sanctions
the fire occurred exactly 1 month post the mosque incident why
and many promise to rebuild the cathedral and to what god exactly
perhaps karma is catching up for what the european french has done to many non-whites with destruction as a return and as just a beginning
hold fast the dogs of war
i guess i better not upload to instagram that selfie i took of me smoking in the notre dame cathedral a few hours ago
babylon the great city destroyed 😎☝🏼 the sexual immoral church one day☝🏼
i 'm sure they 'll replace it with a big beautiful mosque
a church with gargoyles has burned good
playing that black card great work
sins of the priests who have sodomized so many children going up in flames
wake up civilized world
it was probably a muslim starting the fire haha
lol
good riddance

Hurricane michael
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
so many people going to be homeless along with pets scared stray animals
seems the tax money from cannabis legalization would come in handy
so much disaster all over the world and yet people still continue to be unkind and hurt and harm people
when will we learn to live in peace
all employees make sure you park company vehicles under the hotel 's driveway roof
we upgraded to full coverage while saving 5 by switching to geico
my thoughts and prayers for everyone in florida and everyone who lost their homes in hurricane michael thoughts and prayers from new jersey may god be with you and may god keep you strong y'all are going to rebuilt from this florida strong
another huge tax cut for the wealthy will fix all this in no time
sooooo is this a turning point of how we build buildings near the ocean
do we need to find a better way to build power lines so that they are protected during major storms
also why are n't the windows hurricane proof if you live near the ocean it should be in building codes..so much destruction..ya know the trees do the most damage so what next
dear precious one it is so important for you to know that we always have our lord jesus christ 's attention and that his strength brings confidence security and protection to those whom loves him
jesus cares so much about you and wants you to always come to him in prayer
he is the “ most high ” the “ almighty ” psalm 91:1
his position is exalted and his power is limitless yet he is accessible to us
one young weaver was happy and successful while the others were always experiencing trouble
when the boy was asked why he was so successful he said “ didn ’ t you notice how often i called for the king ” they replied “ yes but he ’ s very busy and we thought you were wrong in disturb him so frequently
the boy answered i just took him at his word and he was always happy to help me
our savior jesus christ is like that king only much much greater
he is loving and kind enough to care about our smallest concerns and faintest whisper
call upon him by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our savior
welcome the righteousness of jesus christ into your life
you will then be secured and justified in salvation
you will be rewarded greatly and your life will be forever changed.❤️❤️❤️
please find comfort in praying the following prayer with me dear lord jesus it is amazing to me that you my lord and savior and father god who created the universe care about me and want me to come to you in prayer thank you for loving me so much
may father god bless you in the mighty name of jesus christ
i love it when i hear about hurricanes blasting red states into oblivion
it makes me happy

i would like to know why you guys do n't build your homes out of concrete the damage would not be so severe because where i am we do not build houses out of wood and in 2017 we had the most powerful storm came true and that was hurricane irma my country got a direct hit and i had no damage to my home
wow that 's just amazing
we got fires and earthquakes out here in the west but a massive storm like that affects more people in a short period of time
now you guys have a idea of what we going true after last year category 5 hurricane in p.r
thanks god the hurricane when fast and now is time to get united and work together to rise again
americans make houses extremely cheap
why is there so many hurricane happening in such close time frame
the footage they captured was intense
imma send prayera so everything gets fixed instead of donating food
was almost a category five wow
spray it with oxy clean and it ’ s good as new ” billy mays
god speed and good luck
wow
the history it 's not worth it men stay safe
lol god pulled out that 2 card on yall
wow what did michael jackson do now
am not from there but may god the father show his mighty love on you
be wise
but i pray for those in florida georgia and please do not cause more destruction
cheap construction
i live in south carolina and we 're supposed to have effects later on
be safe
you look a lot prettier when you smile
i live in florida
it was completely normal weather here in st lucie
keep safe and thank you for the exceptional coverage
sometimes you sort of forget how powerful nature can be
we love climate change 😭😭😭😭
thank you governor rick scott a for leading the people there you do an excellent job
people from panama city beach are y'all ok
stay dry and safe florida people
wow watching this i get flashbacks from maria it was exactly like this wow i hope everyone stay safe
a great concert of michael jackson shake shake
i hope everyone stays safe
florida deserves it lmao
prayers and peace for the wonderful people in the florida panhandle
adult me feels for those who live in that area and little boy me is like cool
yeah but according to repubs climate change is n't man made and is not an important issue lol vote them out
none of us are safe
geo-engineered storm directed at americas red state hope and prayers to all of you to stay safe
welcome to the end times
incredible footage
thanks abc great coverage very brave reporting
stay safe guys and girls god be with you
i will it what is going on on youtube incredible

more like check in parking area roof yes
awesome coverage by david muir
be safe
i have family in panama city so i been anxious sincei heard it was going to hit and they lost power so i have n't been able to get ahold of any of them
this seems to be the most raw micheal footage
stunning
this news crew took too much of a risk
here in south florida we have n't experienced anything
it is written that god so loved the world he gave us his only begotten son yeshua that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
he rose again the 3rd day and has assured us of our redemption
i pray you all accept this wonderful gift from god today by making him lord of your life
all you need is faith as a mustard seed and sincere words from your heart
he will hear you make you new deliver you from your sins and from the judgement headed to this earth
these kind of storms will become more and more common as the effects of climate change become more prevalent
instead of sending thoughts and prayers why dont you help fight climate change instead that will help wayy more
good luck and stay strong yall
mother nature really doesnt like florida
congratulations michael you doing a good job
hey gop climate change is real
so blessed that we don ’ t have this here..keep safe people as long as your love ones are ok the rest is material possessions
it will be a battle but stay strong 🙏
is their anyway to make those walls more sturdy after the pass
did he drop a new album
i live in florida
the earth is having birth pain is ready to spew so many sinners off her
the map projects the storm headed directly our way in athens ga
stay strong the people of florida
welcome to the end times
i hope my grammy is ok
i live there i 'm evacuated my best friend lost his house
i love seeing god work
we filipinos are used to that kind of storm
right wing nuts are saying today
a good guy with a hurricane would 've stop that bad guy with a hurricane
got ta love climate change it 's all fake news right
�your face would look better between my legs.�
be humble people
i got lucky it was just some rain and some wind
this is sad best beaches in the world
we have not been able to get current news for our area all day
even this weather report is old
1969 i think is when hurricane camille came through and spun off so many tornadoes
it 's a good thing we do n't send our money to other countries now
damn they got it real good
ight they got the name right
o hopes and prayers to all of you in the hurricane
very fine news reporting
for all these things occurring worldwide are just the beginning of sorrows more to come
be strong florida
hope they have good incurrence
guide and protect them in they precious name amen
man alive
the easy part is over
202nd comment lmao
thats right michael parge the wicked
wow prayers from ukraine
so happy my relative moved from florida months ago
that escalated quickly
i ’ m originally from the panhandle and i lost my house in hurricane ivan years ago
the only good thing about a storm is how strong it makes the community afterwards
keep praying maybe trump will care about you lol
florida needs to be wiped off the map anyways lol
great reporting david be safe buddy👼🙏✝️📖📑👣💛✝️✝️✝️
im embarrassed for all of you that see this is a funny thing
thats exactly how hurricane maria felt like like civilization was torn down
like 21 playing out in real time
some of us still do n't believe the end is near this is nothing
that force coming through right before the hotel pillar gives way and the roof comes down is uncanny
that ’ s an easy 150 to replace the windshield in her car
stay safe all 🙏❣
i 've got a my niece in georgia lord keep her safe and her family.😦 she 's in the path
every people safe after hurricane
wow
real news on abc while cnn and msnbc continue non stop propaganda on donald trump
florida gets another hurricane for the year first irma now michael
the end is near
i love florida but my god they always get hit with hurricans
a moment of silence for all of those who will not be able to play cod tn 😔
damn miami is lucky this year sorry for the panhandle have a nice day
just build lol
this is the beginning more to come
build concrete homes instead of wood
is tampa ok
whilst telling them it ’ s fine
ok but y would u live near a beach y not live in the middle like 2 or three hours away
chemtrails haha geo storm real time the movie showed yall 🐑
i hope that anyone hit by the hurricane has a quick and safe recovery❤️🙏🏾
thanks obama
free dollar store reparations
hope they got those rooms for free
the most high is bringing judgement to america
so many climate change alarmists
noooo i live in georgia
let 's see i can fly
i 'm lucky that i live in nj and no hurricanes often come here
hope everyone is safe and with their families😌
muricans why do you live in card houses lol
okay soooooo maybe just maybe climate change is a real thing 😬
well michael will most likely be retired
nature always wins
i hope they will be safe again
i understand that this had occurred and this was just one of the second most biggest hurricanes since 1969
i ’ m so scared my great grandma and grandpa live in florida and we ’ ve went to that beach before 😭😭
i just wan na know how they got all those good shots in that wind and the camera stayed stable
mother nature really doesnt like flordia
some one tell trump that climate change is real
first kinda
don ’ t worry it ’ s just the hurricane mod
looks fun how much to go
fast clean up ahead not katrina we white folks in deez parts
hurricanes are so interesting
the earth is so beautiful isnt it
so sad for all involved glad the hotel gave shelter for the people still nice people around
damn i ’ m over here in miami with some good ass weather
just imagine that in 3 more weeks that area would had get hitted by a cat 5 hurricane
wow florida just ca n't have a break
weatherman mike seidel would have loved to be there to experience the real storm named in his honor
i ’ m not in panama city but i was in santa rosa and we left to a shelter during the storm we came home and our area was okay
do n't worry floridians i am sure trump will arrive soon to throw you some paper towels if you 're really lucky he may even dedicate a golfing trophy to you
wow i love that
natural disasters is powerful than gossiping
i hope u guys will be ok
micheal the original father form the vampire diaries
more hurricane is coming if people not going to do something
it escalated from a tropical storm to cat 4 that quick
god is trying to wake people up because there 's a much greater crisis ahead
much much worse and more widespread than this
lmao my package of clothes might get lost
right in the middle of the action
be safe
stay strong
i live in marion county florida
wtf what kind of people dislike these types of videos
oh wow
lmao
news reporter as you can see here young kyle jenkins is going on a shooting rampage right in front of me lets follow and investigate
so much focus on roofs good report on roofs
be safe everyone
1 economy on the planet you 'd think americans would build more solid houses
comments are a real shitshow here
very happy about hurricanes hitting us much deserved punishment for denying science of climate change you can pray to imaginary powers all you want reality of the world will hit your delusional person anyway
pray that everyone gets out of this hurricane safely
i have an old high-school friend in mexico beach named chuck guard
i hope he is okay
natural disasters is gods punishment for our sins
thanks for doing professional news coverage
i didnt know that hurricane was going to be this strong
epic
we were totally destroyed by hurricane irma last year never ever have i experienced a storm that powerful shook our apartment for 2 hours tore roofs off toss boats cars all over the place
may god be with those people that were affected by hurricane michael stay strong 💪🏾 and stay prayed up
it doesn ’ t matter how much you pray these people still lost everything
president panama city and mexico beach have been nearly wiped off by a hurricane
i wish we could help but amurica first
funny how the largest pop of unbelievers for global warming get get hit the most
we most get accustom to this weather
dade/broward/monroe not sure if palm beach has them too
do n't worry people the whole country will taste gods wrath
i hope all people there are safe
wonder why things are getting so intense everywhere
isaiah 29:6 thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire
this is great reporting but it 's important to note that this hotel is in panama city beach where the winds were only 100 mph category 2 strength
get right with god people we 're living in the end times
who knows if things will get worse or better there are more hurricanes then ever
wow 😳😑☹️
this reporter is brave and handsome no homo
as someone who is not personally effected from the hurricane but has a lot of family in mexico city thanks for the prayers
my grandmother and uncle lost their little convince store and houses but were luckily evacuated to another uncle in tallahassee
thanks again

i live in alabama and we ’ re going to be in red zone tonight i think
why not built concrete buildings where there 's risk of hurricane
i live in raleigh north carolina florence brought a little bit of rain and wind and it was right off the coast but michael brought a ton more rain and a lot more branches/trees came down
looks fun
i live in new bern
i live in panama city beach and stayed because we couldn ’ t find a hotel for 4 dogs and a cat
i was lucky but sadly not everyone was
many years ago i lived in japan a pet of my master yoshi mimicking his movements from my cage and learning the mysterious art of ninjitsu for yoshi was one of japan 's finest shadow warriors
his only rival was a man named oroko saki and they competed in all things but in nothing more fiercely than for the love of a woman tang shen
shen 's love was only for my master and rather than see him fight saki for her hand she persuaded yoshi to flee with me to america
i remember it well as my master returned home to find his beloved shen lying on the floor and then he saw her killer
i could not imagine a solid cat3 or higher coming thru
am i the only one thinking how much stuff you could steal
oh my i 'm so glad i did n't go there for fall break cause that 's where i usually go for vacation that 's really scary i hope they are all ok
there 's too much destruction that 's reminiscent and quite similar in nature to that of hurricane andrew
my 20 year old concrete house can withstand and storm
haha
would be nice to get real reporting rather than these overpaid abc dorks
be safe everyone
may god make them suffer more for what they 've done to middle east
people of florida stay strong
man i sure wish a hurricane would hit the white house xd
super
time is precious
i have the best way to aviod this kind of tragic disaster get the hell out of florida 😎
you live on a coastline and built a house from wood
i think they were testing a new weapon
trust me if we had built a wall a beautiful wall a wall so treemendus like just treemendus huge all around florida paid for by the animals in mexico the island of florida would be safe
perfectly safe believe me
fortunately michael was a fast-mover
this is why the florida coast used to be simple 1 or 2-story reinforced cinder block structures they could withstand hurricanes and were cheap to repair
i had a friend that lived in virginia and he moved 2 weeks ago he thought hurricane florence was going to hit us but luckily it didnt
all my best hopes and prayers may be with you
panama city a beach full of homos and white snobs
if your gon na live in fl better have a brick house reinforced with concrete and steel beams built 20 feet above your ground level or your shit is gon na get messed up eventually
pray people are safe and no one lost their live
i ’ m a 8yr old kid loving this my life is a lie now
wow
say do you wait for us anything except one of the two best things martyrdom or victory while we await for you either that allah will afflict you with a punishment from himself or at our hands
lol
wait you mean something significant is trending on youtube
did i accidentally jump into a new timeline
quit naming hurricanes friendly names and people would be more quickly to evacuate
lol
they all doing everything to make us believe global warming is real smh
concrete structures elevated safe ground underground electrical infrastructure etc
well when you live right on the water front what did you expect
wishing a speed recovery hopefully you being on the main land bring all the help needed asap unlike p.r
we are cleaner than weve ever been as a whole
all we as a race can do is use our advancing technology to build better structures its out there
its a coastal area the ocean is vast and powerful
i was on a destroyer in a hurricane in the atlantic there will be many more hurricanes in the years that follow
how ironic that the human race can send cameras to other worlds but we cant build a hurricane proof home
however is demonstrated fact that with the planet warming these storms will become more severe with greater catastrophic flooding and winds
as the populations also grow along coastlines more people and property will be in harms way
aside from measures to ensure we do n't contribute to the planet 's warming what we need are investments in infrastructure smarter storm barriers that one day can help weaken the storm off the coast hurricanes are starved of warm ocean moisture when they go across solid terrain before it actually gets to the main populated lands
we need private/public partnerships that build smarter roads bridges and bulildings that can withstand category 5 or greater wind speeds and better storm drainage back to the oceans
none of which were any fun
i really wished they evacuated when they has the chance but they didn't we did n't because we lived here
cool water park
i lived in okinawa for a while and they get hit by cat 4 and cat 5 hurricanes all the time but their houses and buildings are concrete so they 're barely inconvenienced
thank god i live here in cali we don ’ t get those type of disasters like that but bless those who lost their homes and the lives as well
im getting hit by it right now
it was n't the roof of the hotel it was just the port cochere which you would expect to have problems in a major hurricane
lol
that 's why i do n't live in florida
wow
nothing new here
people do you think david muir or lester holt is a better reporter here
i just hope people don ’ t leave the pets behind we all have right to live
“ the most alarming part of the sentence ‘ we are facing crisis ’ is not the word ‘ crisis ’
an explanation as to why there are so many climate change deniers
if you say you love us so much then why put us through this
sears is better than the storm buy sears to show bezos wrong help sears now now after hours gets 80 cents per share because sears is good
hope they work better than the prayers after the last hurricane
entertaining rappers at the white house oh ok👍
hoping everyone except the trump supporters are safe
hay trump puerto rico wants to know what the relief aid looking like for this one
are you going to throw more paper towels at them
damn micheal really had to do it to em
good ole tough palm trees..🌴 however on a more serious note many messengers of god have been warning you all of these days..especially the bible of which most of you mock..worse and more worldwide disasters coming sorry to say
nice
because donald trump said global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese for economic gain
how dare anyone equivocate with donald trump a true and genuine stable genius
it 's sorta hard to feel much sympathy for people in a state that elected a governor who banned his own environmental protection agency from doing any research planning or even mentioning the term climate change
i mean how many times does mother nature have to prove her point before the message starts to sink in
btw if you 're reading this and plan to respond with some version of but hurricanes are n't a new phenomenon do n't bother
the woman with the children why are they on the first floor
bcz the temperature is increasing there are so much energy available in our atmosphere that 's why the hit and intensity of this storms are hell monster
welcome to our puerto rico hurricane maria world
or do we take measures to learn how to control hurricanes and send them right back to africa
they should just stop making wooden houses on the coast i mean its common sense i live in cancun and all the houses are made of concrete and when hurricanes hit you dont see this kind of devastation
wow
i sure do wish you would overdramatize the carbon that we put into the air as much as you guys try
i truly can not believe the leading light of the free world and democracy still uses timber construction in high risk storm zones
i can feel their pain down here in tampa and it feels like we dodged a bullet again if you live in florida you 're beginning to feel that it 's just a matter of time before it 's your turn global warming people the latest report says we 've got 10-12 years to do something significant or events like this will become normal
this is great
tons of people will get insurance money and new cars
why not show the good parts
how americans can brave the storms and rebuild
why do people even live in florida
ppl got to learn to leave their homes behind even if they just go out of state and stay with strangers or sleep in the car its better than staying in the disaster zone
what kind of country is this they must make hurricane shelter near coast line citizen
great great coverage
i ’ m curious why do people stay yeah i understand the people that can ’ t afford it but for those who are able to leave why do they stay
climate change is true that 's what climates do they change
i live here
for all you people chiming in on this speaking of global warming and what not about the storms how about you do some research and check back the last few years most of the hard-hitting hurricanes happened between the end of september and the middle of november it 's nothing new it 's just that time of year
now we go for a live briefing from the white house “ it ’ s gon na be a rough one ”
god doesnt want people to live in florida
ask who created fema way in advance of the destruction of new orleans
i pray that everyone would be safe so as the animals
two deaths so far
they were lucky
d
wow
i do hope everyone is ok but at this point come on people stop rebuilding in what could literally be considered a runway for hurricanes
ig this is what happens when to many people say rain rain go away please comeback another day
why do people live in these areas
funny how they get ads just saying
this is what you get when you have too many gays
i ’ m happy i don ’ t live in the ya that place is probably going to wiped off the earth considering all the natural disasters like hurricanes and yellow stone wich is overdue already
vote trump for more hurricanes
if this keeps up living in these coastal areas may not make sense anymore unless there are significant improvement to infrastructure
hopefully all the families and furbabies are safe
i live on a tropical island but never saw this yet
ok i live in mauritius and all our houses are made of concrete even the roof.i mean i know what is the feeling of seeing your houses and trees and everything being blown up like this but i still do n't understand how a country like the usa still build houses like that
the coke capital of america where most dealers from latin america reside has finally got the second call from god
if you live there either deal with it or move
i not care about the people but i wan na know if the animals are okay
funny song
making this hurricane out to be a cat 4 when in reality itd been a cat 1 the whole time
this is what happens when humans live off from others misery god is watching you can ’ t go to church or other religious dwellings in the latin world and then bring illicit drugs to harm a flourishing society and live of its misery look at puerto rico and all others it ’ s time to stop doing all this and start using the land to help and endure humanity
there are things that we could all do that our oligarchy corporate owned and controlled government of the elderly rich could do but the people are too propagandized by the oligarchy ’ s media and their churches to be willing to act to save ourselves and future generations
you the american people are responsible for this especially those of you in the media
so this small punishment but big punishment is about come against america with complete destruction no one will survive except those that god want them to be survive and your government n rich people n elites will run into their special underground bunkers and the people of america will be the victim
exactly like floods and fires
those illuminati occult devil worshippers could not stop these huricanes occuring in the us hmmm thought they are so powerful as the world depicts them lol
the most maddening for me was how some people implied that buildings in the caribbean lacked codes
fast forward to now and yeah tell me trolls how did ur precious codes stand up
i will support all of you guys and will rebuild back every single home with mr donald trump and his cabinet god bless america and american people we love you guys❤️😁👏🏻❤️🇺🇸
“ woah hurricane michael more like hurricane tortilla ”
i ’ m so happy this happen lmao hahaha
i ’ m from miami fl and i ’ m glad it hit north lol
abc jika di malaysia bermaksud=ais batu campur ais kacang sebab asal usul saya tanah islam malaysia bumi ni tanah islam tetapi disifatkan tanah arab kerana menurut al-qur'an yang diwahyukan dalam bahasa arab kerana disifatkan agama islam hakikat rasul muhammad dalam malaysia berbangsa melayu pula ada yang lagi hebat dari kuasa allah saya hanya penyampai berita gembira dan duka tapi benar apa yang dikata saya allah akan kotakan laksanakan insyaa allah amin
if hillary was president everything would be ok
being homeless.they loves to make fun out of them so how does it feel
do n't think that just because your country does not get bombed like syria then you wo n't be able to face such calamities
don ’ t know why this mf america builds all houses mostly on wood and stuff they should start building houses of cement or brick blocks america is dumb as hell
haha god is punishing florida for being gay and republican
this right after us in nc and nc coast still reeling from the last one is getting more rain and we are without any reason to believe our potus when he says no worry
they are spending all of our money caging kidnapped children and creating huge tax breaks for the one percent
so i guess it 's kind of hard to care or feel remorse when you were given the choice but chose to stay
lol still can ’ t get this weather thing right can we
most high ai n't playing y'all keep sinning
gods right hand is named michael
votelibertarianparty if you want gun rights and gay marriage
it looks better than mosul iraq after the us troops left it
will it take a tree branch going right through a reporter and pinning them to a mcdonalds to get them to change practice
yes a few people died but most did n't and are good
it looks so beautiful 😂😂🇺🇸🇺🇸😸😸

Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
his eulogy was beautiful
this is a beautiful eulogy
to convey the love between a father in son to an audience who will never understand that the words you speak will never do the relationship justice
great job 43
i love george bush he has the best sense of humor
i did my own dads eulogy this year and i know that it is hard that was a great speech
that truly was a beautiful eulogy
watching the end left me in tears i ’ m crying right now
however i can honesty say i have developed a true honest respect for this man his father and his family
his presidency has high points and certainly with some criticism same as any other presidents
but his character is unique and his love for his family is tremendous
beautiful service to remind all the politicians in that room what kind of public service ethic should be
was one of the most touching eulogies i have ever heard
mr.president i must say you had a awesome old man during his lifetime
during his term as president he passed one of the powerful civil rights legislation the ada american with disability act which gave the disable more opportunity for employment and lift most of the major burdens that the disable encounter
i always liked george w he has a great sense of humor
great eulogy
how our 43rd president was able to keep it together i will never ever know a beautiful eulogy indeed🙏
probably the best speech he ’ s ever given
man its refreshing to see a wise leader
not the smartest man but wise and honorable

aww such an awesome eulogy by his son rip george hw bush
i 've really learned to appreciate w
no matter what your politics as a president a man and as a son his character has shown me that he has put his best foot forward
his after office life has been great
his generosity with his time and his thoughtfulness with our troops has been outstanding
i 'm sure it was hard for him to say goodbye to his father
he did it with love and honor i wish him and his family well
great family

for sure there was true emotion shown by bush towards the loss of his father
it is often the most of times the loss of a parent

he sounded like an amazing man and a great father to his kids
awww i know how hard is to say bye for ever to your father beautiful eulogy great job this moment touched me
i hope you 're in a better place
powerful
great how he spoke of robin and his mum at the end

salute to a wonderful speech mr bush
beautiful and touching
beautiful
beautiful speach
we love you
lmao 😂😂😂 i like how they turn the camera to bill clinton at 5:18 when he says “ faith and family ”
she said gw was beyond kind and gentle
seeing those photos was thr first time how tall he was
amazing what the fear of death will d ok to the mind and others that feed off it for the pursuits of living
the clergy look like they 're contestants on the price is right
very touching eulogy from his son to his dad rip pres ghw bush
such a great speaker
look at how many people paid their respects to this man
so beautiful
lol he does not deserve this
as a person who lost my dad at age 15 and my mother in may i can relate to w s humor and tears beautiful speech w
rip 41 much respect 43 my condolences to your family
love 🇺🇸
this was absolutely beautiful
i always liked w even though i disagreed with him at times
he might not have been the best president but he sure loved america with all his heart
i ’ m not crying you are 😪
such a great family
wow everyone is there
moving eulogy warm and full of humour and love tears here as i think about my own dear dad
inset distracting pictures for “ the news ” is complete disrespect for the man delivering his father ’ s eulogy
your father fought well to keep our country peaceful and safe
this a beautiful and touching eulogy that you 've written
your father was very proud of you becoming president
the dalai lama said that george w bush may have not been the best president but that he is a great person i think this just further proves that point
amazing to watch so many amnesiac americans just repeat whatever the news tells them to think
lmao look at trumps face
that ’ s was so sweet ❤️
i wish i could love this instead of just like it
i ’ ve always loved the way that family holds theirselves they ’ re very humble
lol lol omg
george w bush did good job remembering his father and mother
so moving beautiful speech 😢😢😭😭
rest easy sir
w gave a great eulogy about papa bush
papa bush was a genuine man of great integrity who was well-mannered and thoughtful
both ronald reagan and george hw bush were great presidents
beautiful eulogy indeed
i just love how the camera zoomed in on bill and hillary c
they ’ re such of a great family bless them during this time
this made me laugh and cry rest in peace
good lord it must have been awkward to see president trump next to former president obama i know i felt the edge lol
no words could describe the love of the father and his child
beautiful sincere moment
the bush and ford family and lady bird johnson family seems to have a genuine family bound
but that last minute of that speech completely ripped me
well i was never a bush fan but at least i really think that this family has their morals straight and are human beings miles apart from the trump family
beautiful
i sincerely hope president pumpkin was not in attendance
a lovely eulogy from a son to his father
very nice
its like my favorite vegetable
beautiful
look at the clintons looking so happy
think again not a mean bone in the bush family a family of profound class dignity respect and humility
so the weapons of mass destruction gives a eulogy for the new world order
beautifully delivered
why does he laugh at the end
btw good eulogy
it was great to see george soros among the people
i love how trump always has his arms crossed like a petulant toddler
beautiful 💖
i still ca n't decide if the bush family members are shills for the new world order that h.w
's famous no new taxes promise
hahahah hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
that 's awesome what a great life with tax payers money i 'll eat some peanut butter sandwiches
president bush your dad is a great dad not just not be still is
that guy please for the love of all things sacred stay off the comments section
many of us are not that lucky guess money does buy you a long healthy life
come on dont be coy
bush and god bless the bush family broccoli never set well in this family either such a wonderful family
so many clueless and heartless people in this thread
george snr was old school and showed great humility and to see jnr crack shows we ’ re all the same really out of our roles.god rest amen sir
the first time i voted for a republican was for him
all this eulogizing and white-washing about the good old days of h.w
remember the iran-contra scandal in the early 80 's under bush-reagan in
nicaragua just so americans could continue to have cheap labor and
instability in their own countries thanks to bush 's legacy
thereby killing almost 300 innocent passengers midair including 66
for the united states — i do n't care what the facts are so much for a
thousands of young men for the possession of weed
shit that many states have deemed legal and medicinally beneficial ever
actions are justified
shit about power and money not about innocent lives god or
president bush we loved that you wept
americans are so gullible and easily brainwashed
get real
an amazing person and a great american just died
thanks for your service and god bless you forever and ever in his almighty presence rest in peace dear president george bush
being nnative texasian i wouldnt feel right not showing up they dont know texaian well
oh may he rip dad an president bush he was a father fo the whole world may good god protect him an his wife..may lord be with his family n give u guy 's strength n make u strong jesus christ name amen with much much love
then on my death have the mass of people kindly eulogize me
i wonder how many fathers he and his father killed
how many kids he left without a dad
we shouldn ’ t judge about the dead that ’ s right
thousands of innocent people
absolutely slaughtered
a great man
he may not be perfect but we can see from his family that he ’ s been a good father to his children and a faithful husband to his wife and thus a good president to his country
lol
no matter if we are republicans democrats or independents we all need to be united as americans and the bush family taught us about family life and love ❤️ rest in peace 41 you 'll be missed but i know your happy to be with the love of your life and your daughter robyn in heaven and i 'm sure there will be plenty of vegetables in heaven
this was a beautiful service
one of the most beautiful eulogy of walker bush giving speech about his greatest iconic father herbert walker bush have ever known
once again i ’ ll always have president 41 and his beautiful wife of 73 years a part of my heart and always cherish these precious memories
he celebrated 911
he helped so many people
our white house is filled with hostility unprofessionalism and extreme rhetoric
conspiracy theories and lies have warped the minds of many fellow americans
it is wonderful to know that carter clinton bush and obama will continue the philanthropic achievements of george h.w
the flag over the president 's casket the men and women in uniform along with the former presidents and first ladies give me hope that professionalism will return to washington
love
george w bush eulogized his father beautifully
truly a remarkable family that shows love honor and humility
people can sure learn a thing or two from the bush dynasty the true definition of an american with value and morale
i really don ’ t understand why he ’ s not next to the mother and father bedside when they passing away only phone call
was beautiful though
i have n't always had that relationship with my own father
seeing this and sully the service dog at the casket choked me up no end especially given my unconditional love of labs
i 'm completely in awe of this man 's incredibly rich life
i was born1990 so of course i have no conscious knowledge of him or his presidency but when you lose an admirable parent friend comrade etc someone who all sorts of people speak of in high esteem it guts me like a knife
ok guys its enough
as much as my heart has been moved still doesn ’ t excuse the condition this world is in
with the exception that ghwbush was a great president towards the end of jr 's speech which i hated senior as potus the rest was very touching and humorous
very touching speech hopefully trump learned something
41 was truly a great man my parents were democrats and when i was young he was president my parents bashed him constantly as an adult i didn ’ t really know much about 41 i was young when he was president but now i know what a truly great man he was this was heartbreaking can ’ t not cry
i ’ m touched by the last words “ dad ’ s with robin and holding mom ’ s hand again ” long love stories will continue he misses her too much so he comes to find her and his young deceased daughter
a thousand points of light
maybe one of the last great presidents
him and reagan both had great senses of humor and h.w
was n't a fan of 'reaganomics which makes me like him more than reagan even
he did it for the good of our economy for our country
although his eulogy was probably the best one i 've ever heard in my life it does n't excuse the fact that george w bush is a war criminal who should be executed for the thousands of people he has killed from home and abroad
president bush jr a very very nice eulogy and i am sure your dad was listening and laughing too
lol
no matter if you 're conservative or liberal that was beautiful
senior bush is an excellent example of a faithful and dedicated husband
married to one woman for 72 years and faithful to her alone oh my lord they do n't come like that anymore he is a rarity
you set the bar very high who can come close
good job little bush in the shades way showing that garbage trump how to be a real president man and human
and what i like was how gb 1 said how his father loved everyone
that is the keys to america is that we love one another
he loved the clintions he love the obama he just loved everyone
and that is the greatest commandment that we love one another
it is a smashing one of a kind guide for learniing amazing eulogy speeches minus the normal expense
ive heard some interesting things about it and my m8 after a lifetime of fighting got excellent results with it
absolutely a beautiful memorable n inspiring funeral
mr choo you 're right
great eulogy
democrats and liberals demonized and called bush sr every name in the book was when he was alive
we may all have differing opinions of all three of the people that i mentioned but this very video just shows the love that a father showed to his family and his country
i do n't care if you are republican or democratic i care if you will just take a moment to put politics aside and remember a father and a husband who wanted nothing more than to make his family proud and who tried his best as all presidents do
may you rest in peace george h.w bush thank you for your service to this country and thank you for loving your family and friends as yourself
what raises this particular service a few notches beyond the norm is its an attempt to rehabilitate jr who was neither a war hero nor a marginally competent president
a truly great man of america pass away but his heart remain to us may his soul rest in peace i did not born during your time as a president but listening thru news was able to know you i was in grade 4 when jr g.w.h.bush president in u.s.a philippines
after i heard of his passing i asked god a question and the feeling i got was one of utter and complete peace
this corpse is worth seven thousand dollars
this war criminal killed many sons fathers you will ever care to count and caused so much grieves to millions
although he cried for his father i hope he could have sympathy for those innocent lives died in vain due to his decision
good riddance
i always loved george 43
well good thing is that he is now where he belongs
i am glad bush senior died now the rest of the president 's need to die and every one of color know 's they are all part of the illuminate
bill clinton appears senile for sure looks lost
we may never be able to reverse the damage you and your father caused
because than we are all rich
9 for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor so that you through his poverty might become rich
should n't you first mourn for the thousands of people you killed
then we could all have one good last laugh at the expense of the millions those two caused to die
i 'm hoping the first person he meets in hell is saddam
unfortunately many americans still love the current president
between those 2 bastards with their unjustifiable wars the wold is better without them let 's not do this when a piece of shit dies and everyone pretends that they were greatness that 's a lie and absurdity
this was so touching i could n't finish it
millions of innocent souls were killed and you will be judged for it in the day of judgement
nice but bush family is the family war not needed and opiates
i do n't how will trump eulogy will be do n't know how someone will do it honestly and the truth
