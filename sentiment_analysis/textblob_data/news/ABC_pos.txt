if a republican was against gay marriage in 1995 they 're immediately homophobic to joe biden but if biden was against desegregation in the 1970s it means only trump and people at charlottesville have ever been racist loooooool
thanks for making it easier for trump
biden claimed ‚Äî falsely ‚Äî that trump called neo-nazis who marched in charlottesville virginia in august 2017 ‚Äú very fine people ‚Äù ‚Äî when in fact trump said the neo-nazis ‚Äú should be condemned totally ‚Äù as the transcript proves
trump has the economy doing great
wow i don ‚Äô t like trump
best get ready for trump 2020
trump 2020 üá∫üá∏ keep america great
the left sure is making it easy for president trump to win again
he is a good divider for our usa and will sell us out with out a dout do n't fall for his lies vote for trump for 2020 and be safe and happy
america would be absolutely f-i-n-e fine with another term of trump
they super want trump to win i see
yes 8 years of president trump will make america great again
he will never be able to beat trump
the old white man that hates trump too just like you
trump and bolsonaro the best president
f in genius lets run on the charlottesville comment the comment trump made was simply that some people think the robert lee statue should not be removed..some were peaceful others were not
and you had better duck because he 's already doing it and if you do n't duck you are about to get creamed by the trump train coming full speed down the tracks old uncle joe
under trump and the dems are once again making easy for trump 2020 to win
i think he could win and defeat trump
not even obama will speak for him trump will eat him alive
trump will yet again win
they need to come up with better tactics or say hello to 8 year trump
trump wins 2020
in the same speech where trump stated there are fine people on both sides trump said i 'm not talking about the nazi 's and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally
this is a new low because biden eaving out a clump of the trump speech removes all context
trump did n't say the neo-nazis were good guys he was referring to the people who did n't want american statues destroyed so biden 's entire campaign ad is a lie and slander against republicans but that 's standard fare for the demorats
former vice president joe biden announced his 2020 presidential bid on thursday morning with a video warning that four more years of president trump would ‚Äú forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation ‚Äù if biden is correct trump is right on schedule
so he just straight up outright lies about what trump said about charlottesville the proceeds to claim a domestic terrorist organization are courageous people
they would rather lose to trump than win with a true progressive who wants to help working people
love how he implies trump supporters are white supremacists
so biden starts his campaign lying about president trump beautiful
yeah easy win for trump maga
biden will be donald trump 's john kerry to bush same old song same old words nothing fresh new
say what you want about avenatti but he is right about 1 thing the candidate that gets the nomination has to be able has to be able to beat trump and that is not going to be easy
many people on the left votes for trump
i predicted nearly a year before the epic and many ways legendary 2016 us presidential election that eccentric many ways entertaining politically manipulative and natural way charismatic celebrity billionaire donald trump with nationalistic political and economic policy agenda will win first the us republican party¬¥s domestic presidential candidate race and after it the late autumn 2016 us presidential election because my all instincts and my usa knowledge said so
i was right and i was sure too immediately after the late autumn 2016 us presidential election result that donald trump will be a two terms 8 years president if he stays healthy and he is personally willing to continue
the us presidency is quite a hard job full of stress and president trump is relatively an old guy
if joe biden is best what the us democratic party which has been in deep crisis since hillary clinton lost the us 2016 presidential election can offer to the us voters and the us democratic party supporters believe me president trump can win the us 2020 presidential election quite easily
besides president trump¬¥s family saga is like the mythic american dream itself since his grandfather friedrich trump moved from the historical kingdom of bavaria in imperial germany to the usa when he was a young poor 16 years old teenager boy and built with hard work the base of the trump family¬¥s fortune in alaska on the yukon-klondike area during the great gold rush with own hotel-restaurant business there
trump wins 2020
trump fox and friends claiming that biden attacked trump i 'm not sure anymore when someone tells the truth the media republican trump allies attempt to alter the perception not just the country is more divided than ever but members of journalist organizations as well because if the media act bipartisan they sure attempt to shape public perception the last 3 year 's was a nightmare but also educational because when the unqualified individuals took possession of pennsylvania ave even mickey mouse would have done a better job
so many negatives about trump not enough positives to even clap once for her
my republican friends say he has the best chance against trump
from wikipedia donald trump sexual misconduct allegations
donald trump has been accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment including non-consensual kissing or groping by at least 19 women trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself can do anything to women including just start kissing them
trump will make him look more like a puppet then he does now
from 2008 2016 the national debt doubled while biden was vice president now trump is running a higher budget deficit than obama two years in
after trump we all need christ not another president why can ‚Äô t we just throw the government away and love each other the whole world not just us in the ‚Äú usa is the best brown people are evil ‚Äù bubble lol all it is is a bunch of liars making money and then there ‚Äô s alexandria ocasio-cortez lol she ‚Äô s better than that but yeah all the rest of them just want to make money and watch you all die
going to be enjoyable to watch trump rip the dems all over again can ‚Äô t wait for the debates again
joe warns that trump could fundamentally change the character of our country as in low unemployment booming economy folks getting ahead all those things need to change back to the obama years with high unemployment banks failing being laughed at on the world stage
he does n't have a chance against a real leader like trump
i ca n't wait for the debates to hear what trump says about bidens child touching problem
this guy is obama 2.0 trump has built the greatest economy in the usa ever
you can ‚Äô t win against trump if you ‚Äô re platform is obama ‚Äô s legacy corruption
biden is saying he 's good for america and donald trump is bad biden is not a progressive he have no policy
lmao obamas puppet trump gon na win in a landslide
will guarantee 4 more years with president trump biden isn ‚Äô t fit to be a night janitor at taco bell
we want bernie sanders and bernie is the best candidate to win against trump
nope he is never going to win look at the energy level of donald trump the man got what it takes
his hatred of trump and conservatives is matched only by his vanity and love for himself
he won ‚Äô t beat trump but he ‚Äô ll be the media ‚Äô s anointed one and consequentially will probably win the democratic nomination
i like joe and what he stands for he may be older but have we looked at trump i want anyone but trump as president i support corey booker myself but if it comes down to trump or biden i am with joe 100
trump will get four more years just because he looks more aggressive in all ways than this nice guy of similar age
if there was a real emergency at the border why did trump wait so long
trump needs new crayons and magic markers for his new bill to sign.oh i forgot he needs coloring books this will keep his mind from wandering.ü§£ü§£
well trump has one thing right having him as president is a national emergency
best potus ever says everyone on the trump kool aid
how many trump family members companies are awaiting building border wall contracts
world is supporting trump leading sheep 's into oblivion
trump is an excellent presidente we have one too bolsonaro
i do n't blame the democrats for this it 's their job to fight for less border security it 's the republicans to help trump support real border security
trump 4 more years
i love you president trump
trump does n't get everything he wants so he declares a national emergency
i think trump wants out
thanks trump 2020 trump you will win
trump is doing his great job but few people realize he is brilliant
sure he will support whatever trump wants
trump health is said to be good
why can ‚Äô t trump use his own money to build the goddamn wall like damn trump you are a billionaire and billionaire
if obama had even attempted this stunt john boehner and mitch mcconnell would 've had impeachment proceeding immediately but it 's ok for trump to get away with it
i m just say donald trump stop emergency plan could present a major constitutional test national why
trump the narcissist wants a monument to himself trump wall
so many problems in the world and in the country and trump still clings on to the idea about the wall like a kid throwing a tantrum
do it pres trump you are right
even if he is told no the dems will use it to set up their own asinine plans and go trump did it so we can
ok i dont see why trump is going to call a national emergency.he can do what ever he wants the border bill the wall and they will still find a way to cross over here
good job trump
another democratic win over trump that 's democrats 2 trump 0 now
first step in dismantling democracy when you end run around congress but keep supporting trump fools
thank you donald trump you 're the best person in the world you 're going to build our border wall that we need desperately to get the aliens out of our areas the drug dealers and nancy and chuck is the one of the biggest drug dealers in the world we need to stop them to fire them or put them in jail
imma tell y ‚Äô all right now trump supporters or not if you ‚Äô re middle class and he does this state of emergency üö® you ‚Äô re going to feel it in your wallet for a while
this is funny to me because it is so obvious there is no emergency trump has the mind of an 11 year old
trump ‚Äô s procrastination tactics like the military thoughts of france before ww2 were the same in the end and the whole army was wiped out
ho hum yes trump such an emergency that you did n't do much about it for two years the republicans were in power in both senate and congress
trump is a great great great man and president üòÉ
so instead of sending money to help rebuild huston california and puerto rico we 're sending money to defend against a non-existent emergency in order to make trump feel better
meanwhile people are going to be losing their land to build this wall compiling no doubt hundreds of lawsuits against the government that our next president is going to have to deal with because trump sure as hell wo n't answer them
trump is resorting to this tactic not exactly because there 's an emergency down at the border but to fulfill his campaign promise of building a wall to help secure the border
trump is fully aware that the democrats are going to be nothing but obstructionists so there 's no point in wasting time with legislative formalities
love trump soooo much
trump is one of the great presidents
thanks to the democratic party 's stubbornness and unwillingness to protect americans president trump is doing his constitutional duty by having a secured border and keeping out foreign invaders
looks like a fine gentleman trump
another trump supporter making the us great again
the more trump tries to paint a picture that 'brown people are the enemy the more his people show their true colors
keep praying maybe trump will care about you lol
real news on abc while cnn and msnbc continue non stop propaganda on donald trump
some one tell trump that climate change is real
do n't worry floridians i am sure trump will arrive soon to throw you some paper towels if you 're really lucky he may even dedicate a golfing trophy to you
hoping everyone except the trump supporters are safe
hay trump puerto rico wants to know what the relief aid looking like for this one
because donald trump said global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese for economic gain
how dare anyone equivocate with donald trump a true and genuine stable genius
vote trump for more hurricanes
i will support all of you guys and will rebuild back every single home with mr donald trump and his cabinet god bless america and american people we love you guys‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüëèüèª‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
good lord it must have been awkward to see president trump next to former president obama i know i felt the edge lol
well i was never a bush fan but at least i really think that this family has their morals straight and are human beings miles apart from the trump family
i love how trump always has his arms crossed like a petulant toddler
very touching speech hopefully trump learned something
good job little bush in the shades way showing that garbage trump how to be a real president man and human
i do n't how will trump eulogy will be do n't know how someone will do it honestly and the truth
